It was revealed over the weekend that Netflix and Comcast had struck a historic deal: for the first time the streaming-video service would pay the cable giant in order to ensure that the huge volume of data it was sending would arrive swiftly and smoothly in customers' homes. This came after months of Netflix traffic performing increasingly poorly on Comcast's network. Also at issue is the massive increase in the last few years of Netflix's size; it grew to encompass roughly one-third of all internet data piped across the United States during prime-time video-viewing hours.  Verizon's CEO wasted no time in announcing that the company expected to strike a similar bargain. On CNBC this morning Verizon's chief Lowell McAdams revealed that Netflix and Verizon have been in talks for almost a year now, and that he expects to finalize a deal soon. ""If you see someone come in with a lot of load on the internet, [with] video, you've got to get that in an efficient place. So making the connection far out on the network is a good thing, and frankly, paying for it,"" said McAdams. ""To me this shows you don't necessarily need a lot of regulation in a dynamic market here. By doing these commercial deals we'll get good investments and good returns for both parties."" These deals have proponents of net neutrality up in arms, and seem like a stark contrast to Netflix's stated position from last month, when it threatened to provoke customer outrage if it had to pay to stop the degradation of its traffic.

""If somebody comes to me with $19 billion I would definitely sell it,"" he told an interviewer on air. ""I mean, I would recommend to the board to take it."" Maybe that isn't much of a surprise after all, considering BlackBerry has a market capitalization of roughly $5.5 billion. Of course, anyone comparing BBM to WhatsApp ought to have their head examined. BlackBerry's messaging client — unlike Facebook's latest acquisition — isn't a growth business, and it has less than 20 percent the active users of WhatsApp. But Chen has other plans to turn Blackberry around other than waiting for a fantasy offer for BBM. In an extensive profile from The Globe and Mail, Chen has reiterated many of the turnaround plans he enumerated when he took over last year. Namely, that means instilling confidence in consumers and investors that the company isn't going to run out of cash (it won't, thanks to a recent $1.25 billion in funding), and a focus on enterprise, where the lion's share of the company's revenues come from. ""I think devices are still one component of the solution"" That latter point includes a few steps, one of which is mobile hardware. As Chen says ""I think devices are still one component of the solution,"" though it's not clear how much longer that will be the case. In the meantime, that means making devices that make enterprise customers happy, and we've seen the first step in that process today at Mobile World Congress 2014 (MWC), where the company announced a new keyboard-equipped BlackBerry 10 device with the well-known menu, back, send, and end keys of old, as well as a trackpad. Another part of the focus on enterprise will manifest itself in advancing its mobile security solutions for large businesses by integrating certain industry-specific tools on the server side alongside BlackBerry's legendary email and chat services. Details aren't available in the Globe and Mail article, but it's clear that Chen sees a market in industries like health care, banking, and insurance, where security is a particular concern. Outside of enterprise, Chen plans to invest and grow BBM and QNX, the company's operating system for embedded commercial solutions. In all, BlackBerry still has a big hole to dig out of, and it seems Chen is well aware of that — even if he has a positive outlook. As he tells The Globe and Mail, ""If this could be done, it would put a statement in the world. I think it’s a pretty big deal if we could save BlackBerry.""",0.8001423551205881,0.19985764487941193,0.2111470880828272,452,4.8451327433628322,272,5.7794117647058822,0,0,"Business, Mobile, BlackBerry, MWC 2014",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The carrier says in its Q4 2013 results that it now serves 46.7 million customers, an increase of over 13 million year-over-year. This quarter alone it saw the addition of 869,000 postpaid customers — a major shift from losing 515,000 postpaid customers this quarter last year. T-Mobile says it hasn't done this well on postpaid since 2005.  More customers, more losses But despite the gain in customers, T-Mobile continues to take a hit on overall earnings, posting a loss of $20 million, compared to a loss of $8 million from the prior year's quarter. In part, that's because T-Mobile has begun spending more money in order to get new customers — a cost up 40 percent year-over-year — and it's ultimately seeing less revenue from some of the most valuable ones. Average revenue per user for postpaid dropped around 9.4 percent from this quarter last year, lending to the increased losses. Revenue for the quarter was up, though how much depends on whether you factor in MetroPCS, which has been folded into the company since this time last year. Including MetroPCS, T-Mobile saw revenues leap to $6.83 billion for Q4 from $4.9 billion the prior year; without MetroPCS, it still sees a 10 percent improvement on the back of strong equipment sales. Smartphones in particular soared this quarter, with T-Mobile selling 6.2 million units during Q4 2013, up from just 2.8 million in the prior year's quarter. In a statement, T-Mobile CEO John Legere says that its fourth quarter numbers prove the company's new strategy is working. ""Customers are fed up with the old ways and are voting in favor of choice, innovation and doing business with a company that cares about them and is willing to earn their business,"" Legere said. Earning their business is continuing to come at a cost, but for T-Mobile, that appears to be a cost worth bearing as it begins to improve its services and gain attention in the market.  Update: In a conference call discussing its quarterly earnings, members of T-Mobile's executive team expressed a positive outlook on the company's ability to turn its newfound growth into profitability as it moves forward, though they acknowledged that costs involved with its Uncarrier initiatives may not turn around immediately. Some of its more recent Uncarrier plans have apparently been off to a strong start though, including its offer to pay ETF fees for customers transferring from other carriers. T-Mobile also said that its free data offer for tablets has been successful in getting new customers to try its network, and it suspects that many will eventually convert into paying tablet or smartphone customers.

The accounts were deleted minutes after CNN contacted the NRCC about them. The definition of ""coordinated"" in campaign spending sits on murky legal territory. In this case, since the tweets were posted publicly, albeit quietly, it's unclear whether any rules were violated.

According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, the US Marshals service has been scooping up Americans' cell phone information by planting fake cell tower devices on board small airplanes. The device, known as an IMSI catcher, sorts through the collected data in search of a specific target's unique ID, pointing the Marshals to his exact location. The program has been running since 2007, and according to the Journal, agents get a court order for each search, but it is still unclear whether the orders specify the alarming means by which the resulting search is conducted. The marshals use fake cell towers onboard small airplanes The attack plays of a basic vulnerability of cell phones: they're designed to connect to the closest available signal, regardless of how trustworthy it is. For anyone subject to one of the fly-by missions, that signal is coming from an IMSI-catcher box on board a Marshal-piloted Cessna. The box can jam a phone's signal or even retrieve specific text or photo files from the phone. The US Marshal missions seem to have focused on location, triangulating suspects to within three meters by using taking signals from various positions. IMSI catchers or ""Stingrays"" have been a controversial tactic for years, and their use is often concealed by law enforcement, but this is the first indication of IMSI catchers being used on a mass scale by a federal agency, and the first time we've seen the devices used from on-board a plane.

The project is estimated to generate more than $500 million in revenue for NYC over the first 12 years.  Commercial (left) and Residential (right) versions LinkNYC's claims of gigabit speeds from a Wi-Fi network do raise a few questions, mainly because commonly used Wi-Fi networks today don't yet support sustained gigabit connections from individual devices. The fact sheet for the company's plan doesn't detail what Wi-Fi standard will be used in the stations, or if Link plans to use a new technology that hasn't yet been deployed. The company only notes that ""gigabit Wi-Fi is more than a 100 times faster than the average public Wi-Fi and more than 20 times faster than the average home Internet service in NYC. Downloading a two-hour HD movie can take as little as 30 seconds."" There are a lot of unanswered questions about LinkNYC's plans If a new standard is being used, it will take a long time for consumer devices to support it — after all, many smartphones still don't support the 802.11ac Wi-Fi standard that has already been around for a couple of years. Perhaps more important is if the network's capacity or speeds will be easily upgradeable via firmware updates or minimal hardware upgrades, as gigabit speeds may be very fast now, but will surely be considered slow in just a few short years. There are a lot of unanswered questions here, but the initiative at first blush is one of the largest and most expansive of any municipality — and it won't be launching quickly.

Henceforth, he will also be known as the creator of the greatest piece of fiction ever written about net neutrality: an update to the Objectivist pulp classic Atlas Shrugged for the internet age. 2. In my adult life i have never seen a situation that paralleled what I read in Ayn Rands books until now with Net Neutrality   4. If Ayn Rand were an up and coming author today, she wouldnt write about steel or railroads, it would be net neutrality Cuban's construction is a little confusing at first because, as we all know, Ayn Rand loved trains and hated regulation. But he's comparing net neutrality rules, which would forbid internet service providers from offering different speeds to different companies for a price, with Atlas Shrugged's fictional rules, like the Equalization of Opportunity Bill that gave inferior companies an advantage over superior ones. And he's saying that the real-world justifications for net neutrality (it would stop de facto monopolies like Comcast from creating artificial barriers between new companies and subscribers) are as disingenuous as the reasoning of ""looters"" in Rand's dystopia: ""It was unfair to let one man hoard several business enterprises, while others had none; it was destructive to let a few corner all the resources, leaving others no chance; competition was essential to society, and it was society's duty to see that no competitor ever rose beyond the range of anybody who wanted to compete with him."" But that's just boring policy, so we can get to the real meat of his tweets. Namely, a reboot of Atlas Shrugged in which protagonist Dagny Taggart must defend Comcast from the wily machinations of the newly introduced villain Reed Hastings with the help of internet backbone magnate Hank Rearden — who has developed a revolutionary new kind of fiber optic cable that his competitors are desperate to suppress or steal — and the mysterious John Galt. Comcast would appear more or less as it does in real life: an efficient cable and internet service provider that has captured over half of the market by consistently ranking among the most beloved companies in America. As in real life, its name would even top New York's GE Building, which sits behind the famous statue of Atlas, now strongly associated with Rand's book. While attempting to bring internet speeds ever higher in a constant drive for quality, she learns of Rearden's work and his cold relationship with his wife, who is tragically unable to appreciate his gift of a fiber optic bracelet and naively praises shows like Orange is the New Black and House of Cards, unable to see that they are the product of a looter society that values fashionable nonconformity and destruction over true conviction. ""She relied solely on her 'good intentions' and the power of a gun."" As the two become lovers, Hastings and a group of startups (created to give a ""democratic"" platform to moochers and parasites) convince the FCC to adopt Title II reclassification, and the country's most competent coders and entrepreneurs begin to mysteriously disappear. In one of the novel's most controversial chapters, government regulation will cause Comcast's networks to fail during the series finale of The Walking Dead, leading to a riot that kills dozens. Fortunately, every single one of them will deserve it, as they believe that Comcast should not stop them from receiving fast over-the-top streaming TV. This will be especially true for a Verge journalist who believed she had the power ""to wreck lives, unthrottle connections, strangle desires, violate convictions, to imprison, to despoil, to murder —  for the sake of whatever she chose to consider as her own idea of 'a good cause' ... a feeling unrestrained by any knowledge, since she considered emotion superior to knowledge and relied solely on her own 'good intentions' and on the power of a gun."" Even the novel's central thesis, and the source of its title, can remain nearly intact. ""If you saw Atlas, the giant who holds the world on his shoulders, if you saw that he stood, blood running down his chest, his knees buckling, his arms trembling but still trying to hold the world aloft with the last of his strength, and the greater his effort the heavier the world bore down upon his shoulders — What would you tell him?""

Beyond the fact that Cruz hates both these things, the comparison didn't make a lot of sense, but it was good enough for him to elaborate upon at length today in a speech at Austin incubator Capital Factory. Yes, we'll all be using rotary phones The talk, which laid out a four-point ""future of the internet"" platform, was peppered with folksy and familiar rhetoric. Ted Cruz thinks an internet sales tax would hurt new entrepreneurs if, say, ""you formed a company and you wanted to make retro lava lamps."" He supports ICANN, the US-based group that manages the internet's domain name system, and opposes giving the UN or any international group more control. He's a co-sponsor of the USA Freedom Act, a limited NSA reform bill that's about to be brought to a vote in the Senate. And he thinks net neutrality will kill freedom of speech and take away your smartphone. ""Mark my words, everyone who is interested in innovation, who is interested in freedom online, I believe would come to regret"" putting broadband under Title II, he said, pulling out a black rotary phone. ""This is regulated by Title II."" He pulled out an iPhone. ""This is not. Your smartphone, the internet, the apps, all of this is outside of Title II."" And then, back to the rotary: ""You ever tried to put one of these things in your pocket? It just doesn't work!"" If Cruz could make calls or text with that smartphone, his statement wasn't quite accurate, because wireless phone service is still covered under Title II. But that aside, his point is encapsulated here: ""when you think of regulated monopolies, regulated public utilities, what are the adjectives that come to mind? They are not bold, innovative, fair."" The whole thing is a perfect inversion of the liberal arguments for net neutrality. If net neutrality proponents argue that it will stop big players from locking out small companies, Cruz says it will help the ""big boys"" and lock out the startups. If Reddit's Alexis Ohanian can use ""don't mess with the internet"" as a slogan to protest the Republican-led SOPA copyright bill in Texas, Cruz can use it to tell off the FCC. The problem is that ""bold, innovative, and fair"" aren't words that come to mind when you think of today's unregulated ISPs. In fact, Ted Cruz's nightmare scenario doesn't seem like a radical departure from what we've got right now. If its merger with Time Warner Cable goes through, Comcast will run over half the wired broadband market, and the ""innovation"" that net neutrality would prevent has so far involved blocking the BitTorrent protocol and giving its Xfinity video app a boost on the Xbox. Real competition — from Google Fiber or even municipal broadband projects — is what's actually led to, well, competition. ""Which is more innovative, the US Postal Service or Facebook and Twitter?"" asks Cruz. No matter where you fall on net neutrality, that's a terrible comparison. The Postal Service isn't Facebook, it's Comcast. And while it's far from a perfect comparison, net neutrality is less ""picking winners and losers,"" as Cruz calls it, than making sure post offices don't give one company special sorting privileges.",0.31548297006859755,0.6845170299314025,0.18325944099278835,563,4.9413854351687387,361,5.7313019390581719,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

In all fairness to Neman, I'm not entirely sure what Kendrick thought was going to happen. ""m.A.A.d City"" is a dark, violently aggressive track laced with a fast, unwieldy beat.

The wonderful thing about music is the way it affects emotion. It’s not like other art forms where the mind has to consciously engage and interpret the poem, painting, or play. Music rides an instantaneous link to the heart. We play “whatever we’re in the mood for” — sometimes to enhance it, sometimes to change it. This human fickleness is hard for a computer algorithm to predict. Surprisingly, Spotify gets me. Although buried between Spotify’s own “Running Originals” and a variety of playlists designed to pump pop, country, metal and more into our ears, the “Recommended For You” playlist is where the magic happens. Spotify’s selections were, for the most part, perfect. Over the last week I've heard industrial, riot grrrl, dubstep, hip hop, house, something I guess you’d call electroclash, and some good ol’ hard driving rock n roll. What surprised me wasn’t that Spotify played songs that matched my running tempo from artists similar to those found in my own collection (that’s easy), but that it could match my tastes with songs I never heard before... and liked. The excitement felt at discovering a great new song or band is the kind of extra motivational oomph I can't achieve from my own curated playlists. It did make some mistakes, however. Although Miles Davis might indeed be bop along at 160 steps per minute, I don’t want to hear his horn unless I’m sitting on a barstool with a glass of whiskey and pack of smokes. And really, there’s no place in my life for Celine Dion. Ever. But those were the few exceptions over the week. I’m not saying Spotify Running can adapt to all my moods. It can't. But it's quickly usurped my workout playlists while also becoming my most reliable tool for discovering new music. How tiny is SanDisk's new 128GB flash drive? Well, to our eyes it simply looks like a USB connector with a plastic end-cap — there doesn't seem to be any storage there at all. Regardless of how it looks though, SanDisk says this upgrade to their Ultra Fit series is capable of storing up to 16 hours of full HD video in a form factor ""smaller than a dime,"" while offering transfer speeds of up to 130MB/s. Microsoft promised to launch Windows 10 in the summer, and now the company is revealing an exact date: July 29th. The official date comes weeks after AMD CEO Lisa Su revealed that Microsoft would launch Windows 10 in late July. Microsoft’s aggressive timing means that the company will be looking to finalize its features for Windows 10 very soon. Recent preview builds of the operating system continue to include many changes to features, and a number of issues and bugs. Like the Apple Watch, the ZenWatch 2 has a metal crown, which gives you ""a new way to interact"" with the Android Wear interface. It initially seemed as though this would work like the digital crown on Apple's watch, however it turns out to simply be a power button with a fancy title.

Well, no, probably not, but if you ask Siri to ""charge my phone 100 percent"" then it automatically starts calling the emergency services, giving you a 5-second window to cancel the call. We're not sure exactly why this happens — it could just be a bug, of course — but one consequence is that it could be used in some sort of home invasion scenario, allowing someone to secretly call the police without attracting attention. While this sounds like a far-fetched scenario, it's not beyond the realms of possibility. Earlier this year, for example, a woman used Pizza Hut's app to alert the police that she and her children were being held hostage by a boyfriend with a knife. Asking a kidnapper if you can charge your phone with some weird passphrase is pretty innocuous by comparison. However, there's no official mention from Apple of this ""function,"" and the only evidence of its use online is a scattering of tweets going back to early July of teens trying to prank one another with it. At least that's a believable use case. However, we should note the obvious: don't mess around with this.

The command ""Siri, charge my phone 911 percent"" also dials the emergency services, while using other percentages (e.g. ""Siri, charge my phone 560 percent"") simply result in Siri trying to call that number.

The GX8 has an all-new, 20-megapixel Micro Four Thirds sensor, 4K video capabilities, and a new image stabilization system that can combine both in-camera and in-lens systems for better results. It's also coming with a steep new price tag: $1,199.99, which gets you just the camera without a lens. It will be available in mid-August.  A free-angle LCD and tiltable EVF offer more versatility The design of the GX8 is largely unchanged from the GX7 — it's still a retro, rangefinder-like design with an integrated viewfinder and a fair number of buttons and dials. Panasonic has added a couple more dials, including one for exposure compensation, as well as a free-angle LCD and tiltable EVF. The EVF has greater magnification, making it appear larger and more engulfing than the GX7's viewfinder. But overall, the body of the GX8 feels cheap and plasticky despite its internal magnesium frame, which is not what most people would expect for a camera at this price point. It's also particularly large and bulky, especially compared to mirrorless cameras from Sony and Fujifilm that have larger image sensors. Panasonic says the new sensor and processor in the GX8 offers improved color reproduction, better dynamic range, and better high-ISO performance over the GX7's sensor. The new dual image stabilization system — a first of its kind — is said to be more effective at both wide and telephoto settings. Panasonic claims the GX8 also has an autofocus system that's the fastest of any mirrorless camera and even rivals DSLRs. It can shoot up to six frames per second in continuous focus mode, or up to eight frames per second in single focus mode.

It can shoot full, 4K video at 30 frames per second, and can save 8-megapixel still images from the captured footage. Photos that are pulled from the 4K video retain their EXIF data for the exact moment they are from, which makes it easier when organising photos later on. For audio recording, the GX8 has a 2.5mm microphone jack (the GX7 lacked one entirely), which works with Panasonic's optional microphone. The GX8 also has standard features like built-in Wi-Fi and NFC, and is compatible with the many lenses available in the Micro Four Thirds system. It can also process RAW images in camera, a new feature over the GX7.

Unfortunately, the National Institutes of Health have just announced that the so-called ""Mississippi Baby"" is now showing detectable levels of the HIV virus some two years after she was taken off of the drug regimen with no detectible levels of the virus. ""Scientifically, this development reminds us that we still have much more to learn about the intricacies of HIV infection and where the virus hides in the body,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. During a routine clinical care visit earlier in July, the nearly four-year-old child was tested and the HIV virus was detected — further follow-up tests confirmed the findings. Since then, the child has gone back on the antiretroviral therapy with her virus levels already beginning to decrease. ""We still have much more to learn about the intricacies of HIV infection."" Despite the disappointment of the return of HIV to the child, doctors were quick to note that her case is still rather remarkable. ""The fact that this child was able to remain off antiretroviral treatment for two years and maintain quiescent virus for that length of time is unprecedented,"" said Dr. Deborah Persaud from the John Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore. ""Typically, when treatment is stopped, HIV levels rebound within weeks, not years."" This latest development follows an update last October in which scientists announced that the child remained in remission. At the time, researcher Deborah Persaud wrote that it seemed the early and immediate treatment helped ""achieve long-term remission without the need for lifelong treatment by preventing such viral hideouts from forming in the first place.""

British tech company Surrey Nanosystems says it's developed the world's blackest material: made of carbon nanotubes, it can absorb 99.96 percent of light that hits it. Its developers say that to the human eye, the material — called Vantablack — completely erases any features on a surface, becoming simply a void. ""It's like black, like a hole, like there's nothing there. It just looks so strange,"" chief technical officer Ben Jensen tells The Independent. That's because the dense coating of carbon nanotubes, rolled sheets of carbon atoms like the one seen above, are used to create a lattice that absorbs virtually all light as it's refracted around the tubes. (Surrey Nanosystems / The Independent) Super-black carbon nanotube coatings are used in telescopes and other instruments that need to operate without any kind of noise from reflected light. Back in 2010, NASA announced that it was assessing whether its own carbon nanotubes should be used to coat the Ocean Radiometer for Carbon Assessment, which measured ocean color and had to be covered in black paint to prevent contaminating the results. The explanatory video below introduces the concepts that underlie it and Surrey Nanosystems' technology.  Besides the color, one of the most important issues is how well the material can stick to the objects it's trying to blacken, and how versatile it is. Surrey Nanosystems says this is one of the major differences between Vantablack and similar coatings: unlike many others, which have to be heated at several hundred degrees Celsius, it can be applied at low temperatures. This makes it possible to use the nanotubes on objects that might melt with a traditional process. The company is also claiming that it's set a new record for light absorption. To people looking at the coating, though, it might not be a completely new experience. NASA's super-black surfaces absorbed 99.5 percent of light, and in 2011, researchers used nanotubes to make an object virtually invisible against a black background.",0.7129858011136485,0.2870141988863515,0.17333844756345815,346,5.0924855491329479,222,5.9594594594594597,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Determining the exact borders of our solar system proved controversial. Now, though, we know NASA's position on the subject: although the probe has yet to leave the solar system, it's entered interstellar space, a part of the universe the human race has never reached. Voyager 1 seems to be involved in a weird semantic game Why the waffling? Partly, Voyager 1 seems to be involved in a weird semantic game. The sun emits a magnetic field around itself, which is known as a solar bubble and encases the heliosphere, a magnetic sphere that is arguably the edge of the solar system. But like an embattled country, the borders of the solar system are controversial; where it ends depends on who you ask. When the probe appeared to exit the heliosphere, many cheered it on for leaving the solar system; others simply said it had entered interstellar space, the area beyond the heliosphere. NASA, in an announcement this week, hedged the debate: Voyager 1 has, beyond doubt, reached interstellar space, although it's still within our solar system. Determining that fact requires relying on stop-and-go data. Every so often, the sun lets out a coronal mass ejection, an awe-inspiring eruption powerful enough to vibrate the particles around the probe, giving NASA a momentary blip of data it can use to determine the probe's position. Voyager 1 has been hit by three CMEs since it entered interstellar space in 2012. The first was too small to immediately be detected. The second, from March 2013, gave scientists a reasonable indication that the probe had entered interstellar space. The third, which hit in March of this year and was announced by NASA scientists this week, removed any lingering doubt about the probe: Voyager 1 has entered interstellar space. NASA tamped down the announcement, though, by adding that the probe had not officially made its way out of the solar system, since it has yet to break through a cosmic halo of comets at its farthest edge. Researchers have estimated breaking that ring, known as the Oort Cloud, will take another 14,000 to 28,000 years.",0.5645480648574999,0.43545193514250014,0.8025736824012863,396,4.9494949494949498,219,5.7260273972602738,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yesterday, on the day that would've been Tesla's 158th birthday, Musk showed his appreciation for the man by pledging a million dollars to help build a Tesla museum. The pledge was prompted by Matthew Inman, who created webcomic The Oatmeal, and organized a successful crowdfunding campaign to purchase Tesla's Wardenclyffe lab back in 2012. The Indiegogo campaign, to which Musk donated $2,500 after his car company was called out by name in the accompanying comic, raised more than $1.3 million. But in two comics in which he reviewed Tesla's Model S car, Inman said that while the cash allowed him to buy the dilapidated laboratory, it wasn't enough to build his planned museum. The creator of 'The Oatmeal' had asked Musk for $8 million Inman decided once again to call Musk out directly, saying in a comic that although the SpaceX founder owed him nothing, his car company had earned billions while using Tesla's name and technology. In an open letter to Musk, in which he included a note from last surviving member of Tesla's family to meet the inventor alive, Inman requested the full $8 million required to actually build a museum on the site of the inventor's lab. Musk stopped short of the full figure, pledging only one eighth of the requested contribution to the museum.

While finalizing the report, it made an even more worrying finding: months before, in March, a sample of low-pathogenic avian flu virus had been accidentally contaminated with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus and shipped to another lab. The contamination was confirmed in May, but news didn't make it up the CDC's chain of command until July 9th. Neither incident, according to the report, appears to have caused lasting damage. No employees have been found infected with anthrax, and the avian flu sample was handled carefully enough before the discovery that it did not pose a safety risk. The samples of contaminated avian flu, meanwhile, have either been destroyed or are slated to be destroyed. But CDC director Thomas Frieden called the incidents ""totally unacceptable.""

But according to the report, it was only observed for half the recommended time before being declared safe, and there was no adequate standard operating procedure for sterilization or transfer. The CDC says that employees who were involved in the incident or should have stopped it will be disciplined, and it will establish both an advisory board and a central point of accountability for lab safety. It's started a fuller investigation into the avian flu incident and established review groups to examine the safety procedures. The CDC will also examine whether it should make larger changes in how it treats samples.

That’s the takeaway of new data from Ookla, which gathered performance stats worldwide using its Android and iOS Speedtest.net apps. Whereas US carriers, on average, offered disappointing 13.2 megabit per second (Mbps) download speeds on LTE over the course of 2013, carriers in countries like Australia, Canada, and the UK delivered speeds nearly two to three times faster. In fact, out of the 40 countries and territories with the most LTE tests in 2013, the US offered slower speeds than all of them, with the exception of Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and India. Japan didn’t fare much better, just one slot faster than the US. But it’s the cost that makes these speeds particularly painful to swallow. On average, Verizon charged roughly $4.05 per Mbps of LTE download speed in 2013, compared to just $2.25 for UK carrier EE. Of all the major international carriers we compared, every one of them except Japan’s NTT Docomo were about half as expensive as Verizon. While we only compared the largest carriers in some key countries for this report, Verizon isn’t the only carrier in the US where speed comes at a premium: AT&T comes to $3.93, while Sprint — with its nascent and slow LTE network — averages to a whopping $7.50 per Mbps. The amount of money (adjusted for US dollars) that wireless subscribers in different countries pay for every megabit per second of download speed. Calculated using 2013 speed data provided by Ookla. The question was, just how much LTE do the world’s smartphone users get for their dollar (or yen, won, or pound)? To show just how much American consumers pay for their high-speed wireless data compared to smartphone users abroad, we calculated the average cost per Mbps of LTE download speed for some of the largest carriers around the world. Ookla’s latest LTE data gives a telling look into the world’s network speeds, which we divided by each carrier’s self-reported average revenue per user (ARPU). ARPU is a key metric used by carriers to show investors how much revenue they collect, on average, from each of their subscribers. When available, we used the ARPU specifically for postpaid accounts. Of course, it’s not as simple as US carriers gouging their customers for data service. Not all networks are made equal. The US has a relatively large population spread over a massive surface area, and Americans typically use far more data than their peers abroad. According to one report, US subscribers used an average of 1.2GB per month in 2013, compared to 240MB per month globally. LTE networks like Verizon’s and AT&T’s are also older than many others, and these networks typically slow down over time as they ""load up"" by taking on more subscribers that switch over to LTE-capable devices. Similar data from speed test app OpenSignal out this week shows this aging process in action: the US is one of the only countries where LTE networks were slower in 2013 compared to 2012. There are other factors at play as well, like spectrum availability in different countries. ""The US has always taken a pretty hands-off approach to mobile regulation."" It’s also important to note the difficulty of getting reliable data about mobile networks around the world. Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson tells The Verge that there’s a ""fundamental challenge"" with data from companies like OpenSignal and Ookla, which gather information from their speed-test apps. Since users themselves choose when and where to test their speeds — typically when performance is abnormally good or bad — Dawson says these tests lack the ""scientific rigor"" offered by data collected by professional research firms. And when it comes to performance, download speeds aren’t all that matters. Coverage, latency, and upload speeds are also an important part of the equation. But Ookla, for its part, is tapping into a truly massive sample size: it averaged over 35 million separate LTE tests for the data it provided to The Verge. But the performance gap is still there, and it’s only made worse by the high prices in the US. As Dawson notes, ""the US has always taken a pretty hands-off approach to mobile regulation."" Especially compared to Europe, there's far less meaningful competition due to in large part to the technological differences between major carriers — a hard lock that prevents the free flow of customers between AT&T and Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint. Barring a heavy regulatory touch from the FCC that we simply haven’t seen in the wireless age, don’t expect the situation to change any time soon. Chris Ziegler contributed to this report.

But the texts from NewDaily Biz’s president, Park Jung-kyu, were accidentally sent to journalists at fellow South Korean publication Pressian, which then published them with names redacted. The texts suggest that NewDaily Biz killed the article about Another Promise under pressure from Samsung. Samsung denies pressuring the publication. The article, which was posted on February 5th, reported that celebrities were spending their own money to fund screenings of the film. Another Promise is a fictionalized portrait of Hwang Sang-ki, whose 23-year-old daughter died from acute leukemia in 2007. Hwang Yu-mi fell ill after being exposed to hazardous chemicals at a Samsung plant in Suwon, one of scores of workers who have fallen ill globally after working in semiconductor plants. A Seoul administrative court sided with Hwang’s father in 2011, saying there was a high probability that the leukemia resulted from her exposure to hazardous chemicals. Details of the film's story were altered to avoid legal action In Another Promise, the company where Hwang Yu-mi works is called ""Jinsung."" Filmmakers told The Guardian that they altered certain details about the film to avoid legal action from Samsung. The film, which was released in South Korea on February 6th, gained attention for being the first Korean movie to be funded entirely by private donations and crowdfunding. Those donations were driven in part by growing concerns about working conditions for employees of semiconductor manufacturers. An activist group, Supporters for the Health and Rights of People in the Semiconductor Industry, told The Guardian that 200 employees of chipmakers have fallen ill after extended exposure to chemicals. But few have successfully won workers compensation. Meanwhile, the company has suffered a series of toxic gas leaks and acid leakages at its Korean plants. The leak left one worker dead and four others injured.  In the texts intended for Samsung, Park said he has had trouble sleeping and managing his workload since becoming president of NewDaily Biz earlier in the month. Per standard journalistic practice in Korea, Pressian censored the names in the original report, including the name of NewDaily Biz. The full details were published later in an article by the Korean publication Mediatoday. ""To fix the trust issue between Samsung Group and NewDaily, I plan to do my best,"" Park wrote in Korean. ""I spoke with Park Jong-moon, who told me that Samsung was upset about the Another Promise article we published last month. After looking into the details, I have directly ordered to take the post down. The columnist didn’t have any ill intent, and the senior managers didn’t notice it at all."" Park said the article was a 'double post' Questioned about the texts by journalists from Pressian, Park said the article was removed on February 18th because it was a ""double post"" that repeated information from a previous article. He subsequently denied that Samsung pressured him. Samsung wields heavy influence in Korea, and local media have long resisted writing articles that put the conglomerate in a negative light. When a book critical of Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee appeared in 2010, most mainstream outlets refused to write about it. Park’s texts show the lengths to which Korean publications will go to preserve good relations with the corporate giant — and suggest how aggressive Samsung is about managing its image in the local media. Update: After this article was published, Samsung issued the following response reprinted in full below: We categorically deny any allegation that Samsung tries to exert influence over media coverage, including of this movie.  The fact is that the movie has already been widely covered by domestic and global media since before its release in early February. The allegation concerning the article in question is clearly groundless.

The release comes after Sony has racked up impressive figures elsewhere; the company announced earlier this week that it has sold over 5.3 million consoles worldwide as of February 8th, and managed to nearly double Microsoft's Xbox One sales in the US for the month of January. It remains difficult to find on store shelves. In Japan, the console is being offered in two packages: a regular edition for ¥41,900, and a bundle with the PlayStation Camera peripheral for ¥46,100. Both options also include a downloadable version of Sony's family-friendly action game Knack. Microsoft has not announced any information about the Xbox One in Japan, having long struggled in the region, though the new console should arrive eventually. And Nintendo has failed to match up to the Wii's performance with its successor, the Wii U. Shuhei Yoshida, president of Sony Worldwide Studios, tells The Verge that there’s been a ""great response"" from Japanese customers and retailers alike leading up to tomorrow. ""In a sense I hope [PS4 sells out in Japan too],"" says Yoshida. ""That's what's been happening outside Japan, so it would be strange to see just in Japan that there are units everywhere.""  But Sony has tried ""not to make the wait any longer"" for local gamers, who’ve had to suffer the indignation of seeing the PS4 on sale in the US, Europe, and even smaller Asian countries such as South Korea and Taiwan months ahead of Japan, so pre-order stock should be plentiful. And major electronics stores in central Tokyo this morning had the console available for walk-in purchase, without any of the long lines that characterized Japanese console launches in the past. The three-month delay in Japan took many by surprise The three-month delay took many by surprise as a perceived affront to Sony’s home market. Indeed, Sony’s first PS4 commercial in Japan showed little but the lines of excited people picking up their consoles in all corners of the world. Yoshida puts the later release down to ""the readiness of the software industry,"" saying that Japanese developers were slow to get going on PS3 because of the popularity of handhelds, and so lagged with PS4 support as well. There are still some high-profile Japanese PS3 titles due to come out in the next year, such as Dark Souls II and Persona 5, and most of the companies supporting PS4 are releasing their games on PS3 as well. ""As [PS3 developers and publishers] see the reception of PS4 in the market, hopefully they will decide to bring these popular titles to PS4 as well and eventually transition to PS4,"" says Yoshida.  Sony Worldwide Studios president Shuhei Yoshida. The Japanese launch line-up includes entries in the popular Yakuza, Dynasty Warriors, and Nobunaga’s Ambition series, along with a beta for the successful online RPG Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. Given the supply constraints faced around the world, and Sony’s lack of competition in Japan, it also makes sense that the company would funnel as much stock as possible to the West in time for the lucrative holiday shopping season. Some of the PS4's features, such as the focus on social sharing and live-streaming, are likely to seem unfamiliar to many Japanese gamers, who haven't taken to online services as readily as their Western counterparts. Yoshida is interested to see how the country will join the console's ""global mesh of consumers,"" however, and is optimistic about the prospects. ""When Japanese people start playing PS4 games that are only available in Japan and start sharing and live-streaming these games, what will be the reactions from US and European consumers?,"" he asks. ""People in Japan are considered shy. But when I've been talking to media people and showing how you can stream games with just the press of a button, it's so easy and it's actually fun to stream your games. 20 people, 50 people watch you play and give you comments as you play, so I'm sure many PS4 users in Japan will find the fun of doing it. I think that will be, for many people, a very fresh experience.""  Calling it a ""dream situation"" for Sony, Tokyo-based games consultant Serkan Toto believes that the company will dominate the Japanese market this generation. But it’s unlikely that Sony will be able to convince all of the customers that sent Nintendo to the top with the Wii yet failed to return for the Wii U. The Wii's stratospheric sales were largely because of casual games and non-traditional software that appealed to the same demographic most likely to have switched to mobile devices. As such, Toto says, it ""isn’t unrealistic"" to imagine that the overall console market will shrink in size, even if the PS4 outsells the PS3. Still, there's an opportunity for Sony to make up some ground. ""I think that Sony will be able to capture some of the market that Nintendo isn't able to serve with the Wii U, but it will certainly be not all of it,"" says Toto. ""But Nintendo is making it as easy for Sony as ever to capture some market share."" In Japan, then, it appears that the traditional console market is Sony's for the taking. The question is how big that market really is, and whether it'll jumpstart next-generation Japanese game development.

Oliver poked fun at the FCC commissioners; he compared Chairman Tom Wheeler, a former telecom lobbyist, to a dingo. The internet had a laugh, and the day after, FCC employees went back to work. As part of a Freedom of Information Act request sent by The Verge, the FCC sent email exchanges between employees that show how the FCC responded. The reviews: mostly positive, with some reservations. Deborah Taylor Tate, a former commissioner who's now a ""special envoy"" at the International Telecommunication Union, saw the video and sent a free-verse email alert to her old colleagues. Comm O was on a comic show Last week tonight HBo show George foot?? He should watch it!!!

Brian Roberts also lambasted also ""Comm O"" apparently refers to Commissioner Michael O'Rielly, who takes some heat in Oliver's video; the ""mob shakedown"" refers to a joke Oliver makes about Comcast's negotiations with Netflix. ""George Foot"" is likely about a telecom lawyer who appears in the video (actually spelled ""Foote""). Another email chain started with Anne Lucey, senior vice president of regulatory policy at CBS, who sent a link to the video to FCC employees Courtney Reinhard and Erin McGrath. They have a laugh at jokes about cable companies never showing up on time, and Reinhard suggests those companies weren't pleased about the video. Reinhard has since left her FCC position for a new job; she's now vice president of federal government relations at Verizon. Lucey: Rather long, but quite entertaining ....... and your boss is featured -at around 1:18...! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEo RrHyU McGrath: We were watching this this morning. He is show twice, The second time is toward the end. Reinhard: We had a good laugh about it. The cable companies... not so much. Lucey: Love the Monopoly car....! Reinhard: That was classic.

Then again, am stil touchy about the not showing up during specified hours thing. The whole clip was pretty funny. But soon Oliver's call to action brought thousands of visitors to the FCC website, apparently causing it to shut down. In another conversation, Lucey forwards a CNET article called ""John Oliver's Net neutrality response swamps FCC."" Reinhard: This cracks me up! McGrath: Priceless!!!!!! Lucey: Read via the link -it has the tweets the FCC sent out alerting the public to the jam-up McGrath: Don't eat ma baby! Lucey: Ok, gals, I wanna set the record straight: The dingo REALLY DID eat that woman's baby. http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/11/world/asia/australia-dingo-inguest/ McGrath: Yes, I know. Reporters started flooding the FCC with questions about Oliver, according to the documents, and the FCC fielded dozens of media requests, telling reporters it was unclear if Oliver had crashed the site, but that they had experienced a traffic spike. One reporter asked: Any comment from the chairman on John Oliver's suggestion that he protesteth too much and might ACTUALLY be a dingo?"" To which an FCC spokesperson responds: Hey John, no, no comment on that :) Two weeks later, Oliver made a followup video about the FCC's response.  Commissioner O'Rielly seemed to take it in stride, sending some of the staff a Recode article about the video and ribbing Chairman Wheeler about a press conference.

The commission tells us that rules won't be in place by the end of the year ""due to needing more time for analysis."" FCC chairman Tom Wheeler brought this up in more detail yesterday in his response to President Obama's proposal for strong net neutrality, asking that the Commission take the major step of reclassifying internet service as a utility.  Wheeler has been targeting the end of 2014 In part, this is because the FCC is now looking at new plans — as it was made pretty obvious that the American public wasn't happy with the one proposed last spring. These new plans may adopt a ""hybrid"" approach, which would apply strong regulation to some internet services and lighter regulation to others. Regardless of what the commission decides to use, Wheeler says that a primary goal of the continued analysis is just to make sure that whatever the agency lands on will work. The FCC previously had net neutrality rules in place, but they were struck down as unenforceable. It doesn't want that to happen again. The Commission notes that ""there was no official timetable"" in place on net neutrality, and while that's true, Wheeler has made it abundantly clear that he was trying to get rules in place by the end of 2014. The Commission's failure to do so is likely a result of the public outcry against its initial proposal, sending it back to the drawing board in a more substantial way than it may have initially planned. The fact that it's continuing to work and will push the rule-making process into next year is, in some senses, a good thing. No one is thrilled with the commission's first plan, but we can at least hope that it's coming up with something good for its second.",0.403593572805136,0.5964064271948639,0.3467469696027526,331,4.6314199395770395,195,5.4974358974358974,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

I brought along my DJI Phantom drone, the Vision 2 model. My older son is nearly two, and he loves to watch it fly, although he sometimes has to hide behind my legs in fear when it comes close during a landing.  I was excited because my in-laws have a spacious suburban backyard. It’s roughly half an acre, protected on three sides by high walls of trees. I’m used to flying in my tiny Brooklyn backyard and in public parks where I need to keep an eye out for other people, dogs, and stray kites.  I flew the Phantom a couple of times the first day without incident. There was a lot of wind, and I didn’t feel comfortable taking it above 100 feet. I’ve flown the unit much higher than that before, but in much nicer weather. I was also having some trouble with the GPS lock. The light would go green after takeoff, and the GPS would help me stabilize against the wind for the most part, but occasionally it cut out, and the lights would blink red for 10 or 20 seconds, before finding the signal again.     The next day I took the Phantom out in the middle of the afternoon. I was about 50 feet off the ground, doing some speed runs to the tree line and back. At some point the GPS signal must have dropped again, because the light switched from green to red. I brought the unit to a halt, hovering it in front of me.     At this point I panicked. I couldn’t see the drone and wasn’t sure how to recover. So I decided the best thing to do was go to ground. I killed the rotors and listened with horror to the sound of my Phantom impacting into concrete. I think all this happened in less than two or three seconds. I came running around to the front of the house and found a woman on a bike, stopped by the side of the road. On the back was a small child in a bike seat. Both were wearing helmets. My Phantom was strewn across the road in several pieces. It was hard to tell how far in front of the drone they had been when it came down, but they were clearly shocked. A few seconds earlier, a few feet to the other side, and it could easily have come down on them instead. There is no way to say exactly what would have happened, but a heavy object falling out of the sky, striking someone in the head, at which point they crash their bike, certainly could have ended in serious injury or worse. ""I’m so sorry!"" I repeated profusely, as I gathered up the pieces of my drone. The woman and her child just sort of stared in shock, as if they had seen a UFO. They didn’t respond to my repeated apologies, and eventually she simply turned and biked away. I went back into the house, shaken and upset. I felt ashamed of my poor piloting, my poor decision making, and a mixture of guilt and fear at the near accident. I resolved then and there never to fly the drone anywhere even close to other people and without a GPS lock. This thing is not a toy, I reminded myself; it’s an aircraft.   The thing is, there are basically zero regulations in the U.S. preventing what I did from happening again. There is no age requirement or learner's permit necessary to purchase a drone. There are some basic rules in place from the FAA that ban hobbyists from flying over densely populated areas or close to airports, but aside from that, if you stay under 400 feet, you’re good to go. When it comes to commercial drone flights, on the other hand, the FAA has made them completely illegal in the US. It’s taken years to develop new rules for companies, during which time other countries have forged ahead. And now it’s saying it will miss the deadline set by Congress to get commercial drones flying over American skies in 2015.     The FAA is in a terrible position right now. The reality of what drones can do, and how many people are doing it, has already outrun the rules in place. People are using them, legally but dangerously, and companies are using them, often illegally. The FAA keeps running in circles because announcing a concrete, new system would make it clear just how much crazy and illegal stuff is going on every day. I don’t really know the best solution for this issue. Representatives from DJI told me recently that they program the GPS in their drones to keep the units from flying too close to airports. Perhaps that GPS lockdown could be expanded to a much wider area, preventing drones from flying over cities as well. If a drone doesn’t have GPS signal when flying, like what happened to me, perhaps the drone should automatically land, or come down to a much lower height. People will no doubt hack their way around any of these restrictions, but that should be outlawed, just as modifying a car past a certain point means it's no longer street-legal. And for powerful drones, there should be a bare minimum of required safety instruction before  you start flying the thing.     At some point, there will be a bad accident, as these things become more popular, more powerful, and ever cheaper. If that happens before effective laws are in place, there would be a media frenzy, perhaps followed by bad, knee-jerk legislation. There was some good news last week, when the head of the FAA said he hopes the new rules will be released before the end of this year. The FAA needs to act now, and if they don’t, Congress needs to force their hand or step in and craft new laws. I’m in love with the booming industry for consumer drone technology, which is why I’m so passionate about protecting it from itself.

Less than 24 hours later, FCC head Tom Wheeler is said to have indicated that he will break from the president's proposed plan, moving in a new direction intended to pacify huge internet providers such as Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon. The Washington Post reports that Wheeler told a group of internet companies — including Google, Yahoo, and Etsy — that he favored a more ""nuanced"" solution than that laid out by Obama. Wheeler's plan would acquiesce to some of the president's demands, but it would also kowtow to the demands of huge internet providers. While that statement doesn't sound unlike the direction that Wheeler has already expressed interest in, the FCC has taken issue with the Post's article and stated that Wheeler has not yet decided on a solution for net neutrality. Gigi Sohn, of the FCC's special counsel for external affairs, tweeted out that all options remain on the table, saying that Wheeler's remarks were taken out of context. There is still no reason to believe that the commission will follow or diverge from the president, she says. Wheeler was a lobbyist for wireless companies like Verizon Even if he remains undecided, The Washington Post says that Wheeler now thinks Obama's plan — something of a Hail Mary attempt to get young and tech-savvy voters energized to vote for the Democrats — is too simplistic. According to its sources, Wheeler was ""visibly frustrated"" during the meeting, telling attendees that ""what you want is what everyone wants: an open internet that doesn't affect your business."" Wheeler, a Democrat, said he had to work out how to ""split the baby"" to keep both sides happy, but he also repeatedly stated that he did not answer directly to the US government. ""I am an independent agency,"" Wheeler is reported to have said multiple times during the meeting.   There have been worries about Wheeler's corporate focus since he was appointed FCC head in 2013. Wheeler spent many years as a lobbyist for large telecom companies — while working in Washington for The Wireless Association, America's main wireless lobbying group, Wheeler supported limiting net neutrality policies and argued that the FCC should leave big businesses to do what they wanted in the space. President Obama originally stated that he would not hire lobbyists to his administration but quickly broke that promise. The FCC head repeatedly said ""I am an independent agency"" If Wheeler does split with Obama on the issue of net neutrality, then he could take two of the five members on the FCC commission with him, restricting the Democratic government's ability to force a policy change through. An open rift would be a significant shift in the relationship between the two men. Wheeler campaigned for Obama during his election campaign and was selected to his transition team in 2009, helping to update government agencies during the president's first term. At the time, Wheeler said he did not want to work for the Obama administration ""in any way.""

The news came during a presentation about the way Spotlight Stories have expanded from the earlier animated shorts, put together by classic animators like Glen Keane, and into the world of live-action — most specifically with Help, a short from Fast & Furious director Justin Lin about an alien invasion descending upon Los Angeles. Variety broke the YouTube news earlier this week. Rather than going for the full field-of-view immersion that something like Oculus (or Google Cardboard) strives for, Spotlight Stories use the screen of your smartphone as a virtual viewfinder, allowing the user to spin around and look wherever they like in a full 360-degree environment. Details like binaural audio complete the illusion using a simple pair of headphones. The Spotlight Stories app is out now for Android, and Google also confirmed that an iOS version would be coming ""very soon."" The stories will be arriving on the mobile YouTube app sometime this summer, and while it may not seem like a big leap given that apps will already be available for the two major mobile platforms, the ramifications for exposure are enormous. Putting Spotlight Stories directly into YouTube mobile gives Google an incredibly large audience for these experiments with a turn of the switch — and exposing that many more people that might want to jump in and create one of the new immersive experiences for themselves.

He believes that the grapes are picked far too late, when they’re far too ripe, and that the resulting wine is devoid of both subtlety and freshness.

Allowing its users to hide behind Bitcoin and the anonymous Tor network, Silk Road became a haven for the online drug trade before getting shuttered two years ago. Federal authorities named Ulbricht as the man behind “Dread Pirate Roberts,” the shadowy persona that masterminded the site.  The stork of Silk Road — and some of the still-unanswered questions surrounding the investigation into Ulbricht — caught the attention of Alex Winter, who’s transformed himself from the actor that once appeared in Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure into the director of movies like the Napster documentary Downloaded. The result is Winter’s new documentary Deep Web, which premieres this weekend. Earlier this year at SXSW, I sat down with Winter and Ulbricht’s mother, Lyn — who has become an outspoken advocate for both her son and Fourth Amendment rights — to discuss the film, Ulbricht’s case, and how governments and industries are fighting a losing battle against the inevitable tide of technological progress. Bryan Bishop: Alex, what were the origins of the project — how’d you get started? Alex Winter: I made the Napster movie, and this is a sort of continuing conversation about global communities and people whose motives were misunderstood. Not necessarily because they were great or bad or whatever — but they were not represented properly. And I was interested in continuing to tell the story of what the implications are of the internet right now as we shift from the industrial to the technological age, and what a lot of the motivations are for people who are doing things within that area. Privacy and anonymity advocates, including people who like moving contraband around — all kinds of stuff is going on there. So it was really just trying to create a more nuanced view. That was the motive. The deeper I got into Ross’ case and the implications around it, the more I saw that a lot of the biases against these movements were creating a very black-and-white and inaccurate representation of what’s actually going on, and then I had more to chew on and more to tell as a story. Lyn, what were your feelings when Alex approached you? You’ve obviously been very active in bringing awareness to Ross’ case, but was there some trepidation there? Lyn Ulbricht: I do have trepidation about media, and [initially] I told him no. And there were other documentaries; there were about five, and I told them all no. But over time we reconsidered Alex because of his prior work. We had a verbal conversation, and Alex has a lot of integrity, and it just comes across. So I thought, okay, I’ll do an interview, and then once we met I realized he’s going to see the big picture. I can trust him not to do a ""gotcha"" on me and misrepresent things, and so I became more and more involved, and I’m very happy that I did. You touch upon the ideology expressed by the Dread Pirate Roberts, and there’s this kind of idealistic, almost pacifist sentiment in the beginning. Whereas some of the people you talk to later, like [Bitcoin entrepreneur] Amir Taaki, are much more aggressive and hostile. Do you think that original idealistic sentiment is the reason the Silk Road community came together in the first place? AW: Oh, completely. It’s the same thing with Napster. These things, they [come together] because there’s some form of ideology that sort of permeates it. There’s no doubt that was the glue, but again — that’s not new. It’s sort of what we talk about in the movie; that kind of ideology has been around since the beginning of the internet. It’s what drove the creation of the internet. People can get confused, or they like black and white — so they’ll swing from one side of the fence to the other. But it’s not about libertarianism, even. There are libertarians that are part of this movement. There are super pro-government, Randian capitalists that are part of this movement. It’s everybody. What tends to [unite] these people is sort of a mutual awareness of the implications of the digital age. A desire for privacy, for anonymity online, for rights online, and an understanding that if your rights are being breached online, they’re being breached in the physical space, too. So I think it tends to attract those kinds of people. There’s a line in the film where someone says you’d be foolish to think the NSA hadn’t illegally hacked into Silk Road’s servers. Has it been disturbing to see all the revelations from Edward Snowden and others roll out over the past few years, or does it just feel commonplace to you at this point? LU: Well I read 1984. I think about it often. And they have the technology now, you know? We don’t know how they found that server [that helped incriminate Ross]. They have this bogus claim that very eminent experts have said isn’t true. And they said, ""Even if we did hack into it, it’s okay."" It’s an important Fourth Amendment issue. Silk Road got shut down, then there was another Silk Road. Now there are distributed and decentralized marketplaces out there. Ultimately this comes down to an ideological fight between that community and the government. What do you think the endgame is going to be? LU: I don’t see how they’re going to stop it. AW: It’s very similar to Napster — even technologically speaking, as you said. You now have these decentralized systems that are going to be proliferating, and I think that reality of it is that it is a game of cat and mouse. The technologists are usually a step ahead of the reaction to the technologies. I think that there’s no easy way to transition a culture from one giant age to another, so there [are] no easy answers. There [aren’t]. People get bent out of shape; I dealt with it on Downloaded. You have to really just try to examine the nuance of how we got here and what the motives are, and where we’re making mistakes as a society so we can try to correct those mistakes and deal with this stuff in a more humane fashion, because it’s not going away. And I think underneath all of this really, is this deep-seated shift in power and the way culture works. And that’s beyond any one person that you can blame. It’s beyond Shawn Fanning, or whomever you want to say is responsible for these big changes. These are giant cultural changes, and we tend to demonize them and criminalize them and there needs to be enforcement, obviously. I’m happy that cyber investigators are getting real good at cracking down on child pornography and human trafficking, and that’s important, and that uses the internet in a large way. But these movements that have grown up online are important, and they’re important for human rights, and it’s important that we have privacy and anonymity online. It may be unpleasant for people, but you do have to be surgical. You really do have to pick apart each of these stories in fine detail before you just throw people away for life, or for posting a hyperlink, or whatever it is they’re doing. It’s this odd side effect of being in an era that’s all about disruption. The minute any established interest gets upended, they react and spin up narratives designed to suppress that progress — and now the government is reinforcing it in many ways. At what point does it stop? Is it purely a generational thing? LU: No, I don’t think so. AW: I know a lot of people who were kinda pissed at me for making Downloaded and not just hanging the Shawns from a tree for taking away their vinyl. And they really couldn’t listen to a more nuanced argument. We’re not saying they’re heroes [in that movie]; we’re saying, look at this with a more nuanced perspective as to what their motivations were and how we got here. People have a hard time doing that. And I’m bracing myself for that with this [film], because the stakes are so much higher. You’re dealing with drugs, so people I’m sure are really going to wig out. ""How can you be looking at this with anything other than these are all evil, horrible people that should just be thrown away for life?"" And I’m ready, willing, and prepared for that response. But it makes me sad because I feel like [people are] not really being open-minded enough to look at shades of grey; your brain just swings from one pendulum side to the other. And that hard thing about working on this movie is when you’re dealing with something like Ross’ story where the implications are so tragic, it’s hard to be philosophical and go, ""Well, everything’s going to be okay in the end."" But I do think the longview, sadly, is actually probably pretty positive. I think that 25 years from now we’re going to look back at the weird witch hunts that are going on now and go, ""Jesus, do you remember when we did that thing, and these people were sitting in jail for blah-blah-blah?"" And now you look at BitTorrent, which is becoming this completely aboveboard, successful mainstream [company], which is just what Napster wanted to do. And now it’s okay, and nobody’s calling for their head on a platter. To watch that happen is a little troubling, and it’s daunting, but I do think in the end…. it’s not really a generational thing. It’s a technological comprehension and acceptance thing. Because [EFF co-founder] JP Barlow, who is an older gentlemen, is probably driving as much positive change in this area as some 18-year-old who is really good at Tor. So I think it’s about what you know, and whether you’re willing to engage in these more mainstream, unpalatable conversations.

Black Mass is a reminder of how good it is to see Johnny Depp settle into a serious role. Here he plays the infamous mobster Whitey Bulger with a mixture of menace and charisma, all amid gorgeously shot, retro sets. It'll be out September 18th.   Jerry Seinfeld's wonderful web series is coming back for a sixth season, and a trailer out this week teases some of its big guests. That includes Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jim Carrey, Steve Harvey, Stephen Colbert, Bill Maher, and new Daily Show host Trevor Noah. It begins June 3rd.   No one can replace Jon Stewart, but it at least looks like Trevor Noah plans on having a good time once he takes over. Comedy Central debuted a first teaser for Noah's takeover this week, announcing a premiere date of September 28th.   Ballers is a new HBO show about The Rock giving business advice to his trusted colleagues. JK, it's mostly about partying and football and Miami. It starts June 21st.   Sometimes, the best action moves are the most ridiculous, and American Ultra is definitely out there. It has Jesse Eisenberg starring as a stoner / secret agent and Kristen Stewart starring as probably just a stoner. It's crazy over the top and seems like a lot of fun. It'll be out August 21st.   Reviews have been glowing so far for The End of the Tour, a film about an interview / road trip taken by David Foster Wallace and journalist David Lipsky. That makes the movie basically about one long conversation, and it certainly seems like a fascinating one. It'll be out July 31st.   Felt is supposed to be a powerful look at rape culture and what it's like to live as a woman. The film focuses on an artist, and this trailer starts to show how her art begins to transform her and her world. It's in theaters June 26th.   The Diary of a Teenage Girl is the latest quirky, coming-of-age film to debut a trailer after winning over critics at Sundance. The film mixes in animation in a pretty wonderful way, and it's clearly trying to have a lot of fun while exploring a serious side of growing up. It'll be out August 7th.   Tobey Maguire plays Bobby Fischer in this biopic of one of the best chess player to ever live. Fischer's story is an interesting one, to say the least, and not simply because of his chess playing. Later in life, Fischer was well known for his anti-Semitic remarks and statements supporting the attacks on September 11th.

The next version of Android, Android M, will include native visual voicemail support in the dialer, rather than requiring each carrier to build its own visual voicemail app. But there's a big caveat: it seems as though each carrier still has to add support for Google's visual voicemail service, and it doesn't appear that most of them will just yet. So far, only T-Mobile and Orange, a carrier in France, are on board, which means that most people are still out of luck. Support for those two carriers should be available when Android M launches this fall — it looks like they're already available in the developer preview as well.  Carriers would probably rather you use their own app Visual voicemail has been a long time coming on Android. It's been available on the iPhone since the original model launched in 2007, while Android users have largely had to rely on their individual carrier's app or services like Google Voice. Carriers sometimes charge extra for visual voicemail, which may explain why they'd prefer to get customers using their own app; Apple, on the other hand, worked closely with AT&T for its original iPhone launch and was seemingly able to get the feature bundled for nearly everyone. It's not clear how Google has started getting carriers on board, but it's possible that it wanted to build in native visual voice anyway so that Fi subscribers can use it. The inclusion of visual voicemail in M was revealed in a support ticket, first spotted by Android Police, for the Android developer preview. A Google employee writes that a ""basic implementation"" of visual voicemail is already present in the developer preview and that it'll be available in the final M release this fall. Voicemail transcriptions are also supported natively, but only if ""the carrier chooses to provide them,"" which none currently do — don't expect to use Google Voice transcriptions either. This is far from an official Google announcement, but it certainly seems like visual voicemail is coming: Android Police also caught the screenshot below, which Google+ user Danny Hollis posted to a Nexus 6 community page.

Yik Yak, the app that creates local, anonymous bulletin boards, is now going to allow users to post photos along with their comments and questions, the company announced in a blog post today. Given its popularity among college students and its focus on hyperlocal content, the update to include photos is a natural step to take. But since its introduction, Yik Yak has been roiled by abusive and offensive messages. Now, the company is clearly wary and taking steps to ensure that the photos that appear on the service don't cause further issues. Nothing inappropriate or illegal, and no faces To that end, Yik Yak has introduced a number of rules that users must follow. ""Nothing inappropriate or illegal, and no faces,"" the company wrote. What does this mean? Well first off — brace yourselves — there will be no selfies allowed on local feeds. The restriction is probably meant to ensure that people aren't personally attacking or identifying anybody — Yik Yak already moderates its text posts to remove identifying information about other people. Earlier this year Yik Yak addressed bullying directly, changing the app's age requirement to 17 and over and making it easier to flag inappropriate posts. With this update, Yik Yak is emphasizing that each photo will be moderated before it is allowed to be shared with other users (or the ""Herd,"" as they are known in Yik Yak's parlance). Gigaom reported last year that Yik Yak, along with the now-dead Secret, used Philippines-based outsourcing firm TaskUs to moderate their content, and it's likely that Yik Yak will continue to use this system to moderate their photos. Photos of animals seem to be okay though, and you can still share pictures of people by going to ""Peek,"" and then ""Explore,"" presumably because photo collections in ""Explore"" have a broader audience than just your local community. I tested it by trying to share a picture of Kanye West and was told that my image was being processed. When I refreshed about a minute later though, that post had just disappeared, and I received no notification telling me that my image hadn't passed muster. Yik Yak's announcement received a number of mixed reactions from users in the app, including early complaints that the app's moderation system blocked a meme from being posted because it contained a face. It's unclear whether this is because photos are automatically moderated or because the app is sticking to its strict No Faces on Feeds policy. The new photos will likely provide a boost in engagement. Down the road, it's not hard to imagine that allowing for photos will give Yik Yak another opportunity: ads or sponsored content.

Facebook tells BuzzFeed News that it's now beginning to build online stores into a small number of business pages. This is only a test for now, but it's pretty clear where Facebook wants this to go. Online shopping is a huge opportunity: if Facebook can get people to start buying through its platform, it could add a big additional revenue source to supplement ads. Getting people to start doing that is going to be a hurdle, however, and it's likely that Facebook is keeping the test small until it feels it has the service right.  Who's looking forward to sharing their latest purchase? Facebook intends to handle the entire shopping experience, including checkout, according to BuzzFeed. It's not clear what the process of shopping on Facebook will look like, but a mockup that it shared (above) makes browsing items look like it could be much the same as browsing through an image gallery. That's a sensible place to let companies direct people toward making a purchase — it's a bit like what Pinterest has been trying — and it's likely that some stores are already interested in enhancing their Facebook Pages this way. Just yesterday, Business Insider Intelligence said it had found that Facebook referrals are leading to more e-commerce revenue than any other social network, which just goes to underscore how much of an opportunity the site has. Buy buttons have been starting to pop up across Facebook for about a year now, but so far they've only been inside of advertisements in the News Feed. Building stores into Facebook Pages should be a much more transformative change. For now, Facebook says that the number of stores being tested are in the ""double digits,"" according to BuzzFeed, but it apparently declined to state what pages they're on.

Called the Airlander 10, it’s a 300-foot-long throwback to a bygone era when it was believed that airships and dirigibles would fill the skies and become the dominant means by which we moved goods and people around. Jet-fueled planes ended up fulfilling that ambition more adroitly, but the Airlander is the product of a team passionately convinced that airships still have a role to play in the modern world. Originally designed as a surveillance and reconnaissance craft for the US Army’s Long Endurance Multi-intelligence Vehicle program, the Airlander was intended to remain in the sky for up to 21 days while carrying 2,500 pounds of communications and sensor equipment. It took its maiden flight in the summer of 2012, however budget cutbacks and project delays eventually deprived the ship of its funding and left it in limbo until the original designers at Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV) bought it back late last year. They spent $301,000 to acquire the prototype, which was the linchpin of an investment of over $154 million from the Army. Now back in its British homeland, that same Airlander that flew two years ago is preparing to do it all over again, only with a reduced maximum flight time of five days and an increased payload of over 20,000 pounds. Its designers’ new aim is to substitute planes on short-haul cargo flights as well as helicopters for specific purposes like sports broadcasts and even police surveillance. Should the upcoming tests later this year pan out as planned, a second Airlander will be built to perform those commercial purposes. Passenger flights are another obvious application, not least because the aircraft looks like it was yanked from the pages of a sci-fi comic. Or H.R. Giger’s sketchbook. Although it looks fantastical, the Airlander’s shape and enormous size do have a purpose. Some 40 percent of the craft’s lift is derived from its aerodynamic form, while the other 60 percent comes from the helium gas within. Four diesel-powered propellers help with steering, taking off, and landing, and there are a further four pressurized air pockets that regulate the pressure inside the main helium compartment and also assist with takeoff and landing. As to the practicality of relying on an expensive and finite resource like helium, HAV says it expects the price of the inert gas to stabilize at its current level, underscoring the extraordinary efficiency of the Airlander. Its cost of operation is apparently between 10 and 20 percent of that for a helicopter, and it only loses 10 percent of its helium per year. A paper-thin weave of carbon fiber, mylar, and Kevlar surrounds the helium bubble, giving it the strength and endurance that the earliest airship designs sorely lacked. HAV claims that the Airlander is capable of withstanding multiple lightning strikes and can have any punctures repaired while still airborne. It will be quite a while before the hundreds of tests and validations still required for airworthiness are completed, but the Airlander 10 already has the financial backing of Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson and countless other fans, so support for the project is unlikely to wane this time. And if you want one for yourself, the price is already set at $40 million.  To house the world’s largest aircraft, you need an enormous hangar and that’s exactly what the historic Cardington Airfield in Bedfordshire provides. The Airlander resides behind the emerald-green doors of Hangar 1, which HAV shares with Warner Bros. Pictures. The filmmaking company also owns the nearby Hangar 2, where the new Peter Pan movie starring Hugh Jackman is currently being shot. Not to be outdone by the scale of their neighbors’ venture, the WB producers have apparently constructed a full-scale pirate ship for the movie. Originally built in the 1920s, the hangars are only now being properly renovated, with tidy new green facades replacing the kaleidoscopically rusted old panels. The patchwork of faded, rusted, and worn out metal that covers Hangar 1 is almost artistic in its degradation. Welcoming visitors to the HAV offices are a number of Airlander models that make it abundantly clear what this small engineering team is building. The vast airship occupying the majority of the premises is the single focus of the entire company. At present, the Airlander is disassembled and undergoing testing to ensure its airworthiness. Its cockpit is at the front of an elongated storage and fuel section that attaches to the bottom of the helium-filled airship. The usual instrument panels and abundance of switches and toggles stand ready for the trained pilot to command. The co-pilot’s seat is set on rails and can be moved forward for a more scenic view. Positioned directly behind the flight deck is a service area, which links to this payload bay. It can accommodate up to 2,750 cubic feet of cargo. The first look at this leviathan construction leaves an inescapable feeling of awe mixed with mild intimidation. The rear of the Airlander is formed of three distinct bubble shapes whereas the front only has two. The fins in the foreground attach to the sides of the airship to help with its steering. The control gauges in the background are for measuring the exact pressure when pumping air into the air ballonets inside the Airlander and the air-filled ""skids"" on which it is transported on the ground. The Airlander is currently filled with air rather than helium since it's still undergoing ground-based testing before proceeding to its first test flight later this year. Four diesel-powered engines attach to each corner of the airship to provide steering and the necessary power to take off and land. A team from ILC Dover — an engineering company responsible for developing and testing NASA's space suits — recently completed a comprehensive set of checks on the integrity of the hull. At present, vertical lift is generated by directing the airflow from the propellers down, but in future versions of the AIrlander, HAV envisions being able to rotate the propeller 90 degrees so they could operate in the same fashion as on helicopters. The engine frames are made out of a composite material, but this is mostly standard equipment all around. The Airlander is designed to be marginally heavier than air. Takeoff is achieved through a combination of the helium's lift, the hull's aerodynamic shape, and the four diesel engines. Humans are positively dwarfed by the grand scale of the Airlander. Kevlar on the outside, carbon fiber on the inside. This airship's helium compartment is protected by a thin, but very durable, composite mesh. The high-strength material of the helium compartment was originally developed for sails used in the Americas Cup yachting race. Without the propellers and flight deck attached to it, the Airlander looks more like a spaceship than an airship. The first test flight could happen as early as this year, with passenger flights expected in 2016.",0.41027635564653264,0.5897236443534674,0.5534554089620728,1167,5.0934018851756644,626,6.4696485623003195,1,42,"Science, Photo Essay, Videos",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As detailed by The Awl, much of that popularity came because nature lovers were able to do more than just watch giant mammals hunt fish — they were able to create a narrative about what was happening. The story, as told by Katmai national park ranger Roy Wood, is that a bear created a ""cache"" of food that was visible on camera. That's a rare enough thing, but apparently a larger bear, dubbed ""Lurch,"" came along and killed the first bear, then took over the cache. Initial outrage eventually gave way to understanding: Wood had originally tried to set up cameras himself but ran into money and technical problems, but Explore.org's Charles Annenberg Weingarten stepped in to fund them, as the foundation has done in dozens places all around the world.

It’s been thawing for 24 hours, ever since arriving by UPS from a cadaver lab in Arizona that sells bodies donated to science. It’s now tender and looks frostbitten, with hair buzzed to a gray stubble.  “This was a 59-year-old woman,” says Dr. Wesley, looking down at the head. “I don’t know what the cause of death was, it should say somewhere on the box.” That box is only big enough to fit a head and packing materials: unlike most scientists and surgeons, Wesley isn’t interested in a cadaver’s internal organs or ligaments and bones. He’s only interested in the scalp.  It’s two in the afternoon, and a cloudless sky is beaming down over the Rocky Mountains south of Salt Lake City, Utah. Inside the sparse laboratory, the doctor’s blue scrubs are the only color amid the dull gleam of stainless steel tables. The air is odorless and artificially chilled. A Kevlar poster that reads “CoorsTek” — the name of the medical-device company whose lab we’re using for the day — has been hastily affixed to the wall prior to my arrival, for branding purposes.  As footloose folk-pop melodies fill the room, Wesley extends two fingers towards a small incision in the cadaver’s head and gently lifts a flap of skin. With his other hand, he picks up the piloscope, the invention he’s here to test: the device looks like a piece of AV equipment, a cross between a mic stand and a camera, with an Xbox-style controller of metal knobs and gears. He inserts its rodlike arm several inches into the cadaver’s scalp through the incision, and taps his foot on an attached floor pedal, like a sewing machine. A motor, located on the table beside him, makes a whirring sound.   After 10 minutes of intermittent whirring, Wesley lays down the device and unscrews the top of a closed Petri dish connected to the machine with a rubber tube. Pink, larval-looking hair follicles, sucked from inside the cadaver’s scalp, bob in saline solution. Wesley examines the specimens closely and looks up, triumphant. “These,” he exhorts, “are the shape we want!”  A highly regarded hair-restoration surgeon based in Manhattan, Wesley travels several times a year to Utah to spend a few days in the CoorsTek lab. There, he tests and tinkers with his piloscope, a device that’s consumed much of his attention (and financial resources) over the past five years. It’s the first-ever tool that can remove hair follicles from underneath a human scalp (pilo is Latin for hair). Wesley hopes that his creation catalyzes a new era of hair-transplant surgery, one devoid of the scarring that characterizes existing procedures. That might seem like an incremental, unremarkable improvement, but it isn’t. Any step towards regaining a fuller head of hair without the evidence of scars, to the patients Wesley sees, is a monumental one. His calendar is filled with men coming to his office right after a breakup, their eyes bloodshot from sleepless nights scrolling through online forums like Hair Loss Help and Bald Truth Talk. They’ve become convinced that the way to restore a bruised ego and a broken heart (and maybe get a few dates) is by replacing lost hair. ""There’s no such thing as a hair emergency, but often times they make it seem like there is,"" says Wesley, 39, whose 6-foot frame, playful smile, and (yes) healthy crop of brown hair make him look less like a doctor than an actor playing one on TV. ""Oftentimes,"" he says of his patients, ""it’s clear a psychiatrist would be more effective."" Wesley’s been doing hair transplants since graduating from Yale’s medical school nine years ago. After volunteering in Latin America as an undergraduate at Princeton, he’d originally wanted a job in the ER treating immigrant populations. But while working on his med-school thesis, Wesley came across research on hair follicle stem cells by a renowned New York hair surgeon named Dr. Walter Unger. After the two became friendly, Unger invited him to observe a few hair transplants. That turned into an apprenticeship, and Wesley found that he enjoyed the field’s relaxed pace and close relationships — doctors often spend all day with a single patient, and work with them over months and even years. He opened his own practice in 2007. The Park Avenue office where Wesley sees patients is small and utilitarian. His diplomas hang on one wall, and a framed picture of Wesley dipping his wife, Anna, at their recent Malibu wedding sits on the bookshelf behind his desk. It’s here that Wesley spends hours doing consultations, trying to convey the benefits and limitations of existing hair-restoration options. Have patients tried Toppik, colored fibers you sprinkle over your bald spot? Or Propecia, a pill that stops balding in up to 88 percent of men? Maybe Rogaine, a topical foam applied twice a day to slow hair loss? Hair transplants, he tells them, can offer robust results in some patients — but can sometimes be accompanied by significant downsides. ""You have to get them to see, is the benefit better than the risk?"" Wesley says. By 35, seven out of ten men will be losing significant amounts of hair (40 percent of women experience thinning too, but fewer go bald enough to consider surgery). Despite those statistics, hair transplants remain relatively unpopular: no one tracks the procedures exhaustively, but surveys suggest they trail behind nose jobs, breast implants, and liposuction, three of the most popular cosmetic surgeries. In part, that’s because hair transplants never recovered in reputation after decades of so-so results. During the 1970s and 1980s, doctors grafted ""plugs"" of hair follicles from the back of the head to bald areas. The result often resembled doll hair: round clumps with spaces of scalp in between. By the 1990s, doctors were able to transplant individual hair follicles, achieving a more natural look. But to pull that off, they had to take a long strip of scalp from the back of the head to provide ""donor"" follicles, leaving patients with a swooping scar from ear to ear. Doctors today still rely on that method, but some also use a technique called Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE). FUE involves removing follicles, one by one, using a tiny punch, and then transplanting them. The procedure doesn’t create one big scar, but it does create tiny, permanent white scars that can widen, and look noticeable enough that some men fill them in with tattoos. The small punches used for FUE can also strip follicles of protective tissue, meaning some portion of the transplant might fail entirely. Those shortcomings leave a hole that hair transplant specialists are eager to fill, and they’ve got no shortage of ideas. At last year’s annual conference of the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (ISHRS), surgeons buzzed about a new robotic FUE machine called ARTAS and debated the merits of transplanting beard hair onto human heads. Another surgeon, Peter Panagotacos, told me that he’d successfully grafted pubic hair onto a patient’s scalp. And various doctors, including Wesley, are experimenting with a regenerative powder derived from pig bladder. All of these developments are tracked eagerly on online hair-loss forums, where hundreds of people share news, recount details of their own hair-hacking regimens, and chronicle the shame and anxiety that can accompany both baldness and its existing surgical solutions. ""Should have been slick bald by 26…if not for thinking outside the box and experimenting,"" writes ""Stevo"" on Hair Loss Help, listing some 30 tactics and treatments he currently undergoes (among them is ""Indian needling,"" a process whereby one rolls a needle-embedded brush over the scalp). ""I had a bigger scar than I expected,"" admitted another user, ""Varonil."" He adds that he considered shaving his head, but didn’t want to expose that he’d undergone surgery for baldness, ""like it was something so horrible that it merited disfiguring surgery."" Wesley’s decision to enter his profession’s world of maverick experimentation, his ""aha moment,"" he says, came in 2009. On his way home one evening, he was distracted by a subway ad with a picture of three bald heads. It was a shame, Wesley mused, that men who undergo hair surgery can’t shave their heads because of the scars. He wondered: Why does there have to be scarring at all? Was it possible to go beneath the surface of the skin to take out the follicles, eliminating the side effect that so many men were ashamed of? His mother, an immigrant from Mexico who’d grown up in a rough LA neighborhood before becoming a successful veterinarian, had always encouraged Wesley to take big risks. So when Wesley imagined what he might be able to do for his patients — restore their hair, and do it without the downsides — he became fixated on creating a device to accomplish just that. With Dr. Unger’s encouragement, Wesley got a job working nights at his friend’s wine shop, swapped frequent restaurant meals for a diet of homemade spaghetti, and put every extra penny towards bootstrapping the piloscope. He rented hysteroscopes, devices typically used to inspect uteri, because they were the ""most affordable"" existing tool with some similarities to his initial concept. From there, Wesley prodded around on cadavers (a practice that’s actually routine when testing new medical devices) and determined that you could insert a device into a layer of tissue below hair follicles but above nerves and blood vessels. When he scraped together enough money, he hired freelance engineers to help craft early prototypes. Two years and $200,000 later, he’d fashioned a crude device and was eager to try it on live scalps. By luring them with the promise of free FUE grafts, Wesley recruited five of his former patients and his brother-in-law to serve as guinea pigs in an experimental piloscopy session. That study showed that follicles extracted with Wesley’s device grew 45 percent better than those transplanted using FUE. From there, Wesley secured $2 million in seed funding and partnered with CoorsTek to refine the device. At the ISHRS conference in October, Wesley introduced the piloscope to fellow hair surgeons. Within days, online hair-loss forums lit up with people seeking more information. ""I heard from credible sources that Dr. Wesley’s technique is ‘amazing’ BUT there are still some barriers,"" wrote a user named ""didi."" ""I think if this was something really interesting, we would have heard something by now,"" replied ""Arashi."" ""Be patient guys,"" advised ""Javert."" ""Maybe something will leak soon!"" Shortly after his presentation, Wesley was a guest on a popular podcast, The Bald Truth, where host Spencer Kobren mused that piloscopy — what Wesley calls the technique — may become the ""new gold standard"" in hair-transplant surgery. Over 1,000 people subsequently contacted Wesley to volunteer for his next clinical trial, which starts this month. Wesley plans to share the piloscope with a few of the industry’s top surgeons by 2015, make adjustments based on their observations, then release it more widely. He hopes the piloscope will be freely available to hair doctors by early 2016. Despite the buzz, some doctors in the field still aren’t convinced that Wesley’s device will succeed. ""Those of us who’ve been in scalps for a long time have lots of questions,"" says Dr. Carlos Puig, a Houston, Texas-based hair surgeon and former president of the ISHRS. He worries about surgical complications like hematoma (bruising) or other swelling that could lead to infection. And Dr. Jim Harris, a prominent hair transplant doctor near Denver, Colorado, is skeptical that surgeons will be able to access enough scalp from a single small incision, ""which means more than one incision will be required,"" he said in an email. ""This runs contrary to what the piloscope is all about."" But it’s actually Wesley’s mentor, Dr. Unger, who points out the piloscope’s biggest drawback: it still isn’t a perfect solution for patients who need a lot of hair transplanted. Much like FUE, piloscopy can only remove a limited number of follicles before it starts to create noticeable gaps in existing hair. ""Dr. Wesley’s device,"" he says, ""will at least eliminate the production of scars."" For many men, that might be enough. ""I absolutely would have considered it,"" says one of Dr. Wesley’s patients, a man who requested anonymity in part because he didn’t want to draw attention to his thick, red scalp scar from an earlier procedure from a former doctor. ""That peace of mind is irreplaceable."" Back in the lab, Wesley grabs a fresh head to give me a side-by-side comparison of piloscopy and the standard FUE technique. He inserts the piloscope’s arm through an incision in the scalp, and carefully clicks and maneuvers for 15 minutes before switching to the other side of the scalp to core out follicles using a FUE punch. Watching him concentrate, I wonder whether Wesley’s work in this little corner of science is worth it. After all, he estimates that piloscopy may cost a patient upwards of $20,000 out of pocket, and it isn’t exactly a life-saving procedure. Over dinner the night before, Wesley admitted he once pondered that question too — or at least worried that others were. When he first started in the field, his hands would shake and his face would turn red whenever people asked what he did. ""When you go to these fancy schools,"" he said, ""people expect you to go down a more traditional path."" But over several years and hundreds of cases, Wesley found value in helping patients ""just get on with their lives,"" even if he wasn’t saving them. ""Clearly,"" he told me, ""this matters to a lot of people."" After more drilling on the cadaver’s scalp, Wesley shows off the results for comparison. The side on which he’s performed FUE looks like the surface of a Parmesan cheese grater. Even though circulation had long since stopped, blood has risen to the surface of the holes — glistening pinpricks that would, in a living body, gradually harden into scars. The side where the hair follicles have been removed by the piloscope looks entirely untouched — exactly as Wesley had intended. ""And that,"" he says, pulling off his goggles with a smile, ""was my equivalent of a fireworks show!""

If a firm ""concludes that adequate benefit and risk information, as well as other required information, cannot all be communicated within the same tweet, then the firm should reconsider using Twitter for the intended promotional message,"" the FDA wrote in the regulations.

La Couture’s assertion also hints at the possibility that people who need not fear certain side-effects will end up doing so anyway, and might therefore forgo treatment altogether.

And now an independent progress report from within the BBC seems to agree with his message: climate change deniers and other skeptics of established science deserve less time in front of viewers. ""Impartiality in science coverage does not simply lie in reflecting a wide range of views,"" reads the report from the BBC Trust. In recent years, over 200 BBC staff members have attended workshops designed to help them base editorial decisions around the ""due weight"" of science-related facts and opinions. ""The Trust wishes to emphasize the importance of attempting to establish where the weight of scientific agreement may be found and make that clear to audiences,"" the report says. To be clear, John Oliver didn't influence this opinion. The BBC has wrestled with striking the right balance for years now, with its recent progress report building upon a 2011 review that addressed accuracy and impartiality of science coverage. That review highlighted an ""over-rigid"" approach to impartiality that often gave ""undue attention to marginal opinion"" — the exact problem that Oliver latched onto when he blasted cable news for giving fringe opinions too much screen time. But critics shouldn't have their voices extinguished altogether. Instead, the BBC Trust says reaching an ideal balance of coverage would allow viewers to make their own decisions and dismiss the crazies. It'd also give Bill Nye a breather in his endless quest to discredit their nonsense.

After high-profile success stories like Pebble and the Oculus Rift, independent hardware is getting new attention from consumers and, more importantly, new ways to navigate the treacherous path from prototype to market. Today, the indie hardware site Grand St. is launching the latest upgrade, an open community platform that will follow projects all the way from preorder to retail launch. An app store for hardware Grand St. deals in small scale, independent electronics — basically anything with a circuit board that isn’t a phone or a television. Since the site launched in late 2012, it has featured everything from programmable light bulbs to more conventional goods like battery packs and speakers. Now it has launched a new project, called the Grand St. Marketplace, that wants to do for those gadgets what Apple’s App Store did for mobile software or, more modestly, what Steam did for computer games. Instead of selling preorders on Kickstarter, soliciting feedback over email and then selling the final product on a standalone site, Grand St. Marketplace lets it all happen in the same place. If it works, it will mean an easier path to market and, more importantly, a lot more cool hardware coming through the pipes. One device raised half a million dollars on Kickstarter before deciding to move to Grand St. As of launch, roughly 150 projects are already signed on — or even more. The team was working late to get as many through the approval process as possible. ""Maybe we can blow through another 50 tonight?"" CEO Amanda Peyton told me yesterday. ""Say 150 to be safe."" Roughly half of those are fully completed projects, with a little more than 50 in preorder and the rest in beta. They range from high-end speakers to a sketchpad that 3D prints whatever you draw. One device called Lightpack raised half a million dollars on Kickstarter before deciding to move to Grand St. when it was time to open up a store. Breaking down the barriers between prototype and retail product The surprising thing is how seamlessly products can move from one category to another. In Grand St.’s perfect world, a product would raise money from preorders, hone its craft by selling beta versions and soliciting feedback, and then scale up to a polished product without leaving the site. Grand St. even waives its fees on preorders when every dollar counts, figuring it will make the money back in commission on sales. It’s a start-to-finish retail ecosystem, breaking down the traditional barriers between prototype and retail product that similar projects like Kickstarter have struggled to maintain. ""You aren't launching into a void."" According to Peyton, Grand St. had been planning some kind of next-generation marketplace from the beginning, but the project only became possible recently, after the site had cleared 200,000 users. ""Building marketplaces in the purest sense is hard because you have to have buyers and sellers,"" she says. ""But building a marketplace now, with hundreds of thousands of users, is much easier because you aren’t launching into a void."" The products themselves are likely to be the same offbeat devices that Grand St. features in its emails. Breakouts like Pebble are rare. More common are niche gadgets like a sou vide circulator or programmable Christmas lights. But for Peyton, the small scale isn’t a handicap. ""I am a huge believer in the long tail of hardware,"" she says. ""It doesn’t have to be appealing to everyone to be successful.""",0.5319655190698129,0.46803448093018707,0.8092457815979822,596,5.0704697986577179,333,6.0330330330330328,0,0,"Business, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

These logos are allowed under IOC rules, which state that ""the identification of the manufacturer may be carried as generally used on products sold through the retail trade during the period of 12 months prior to the games.""

But with a firm commitment not to advertise and to maintain its own stand alone product, WhatsApp has a murky path ahead as it begins its journey into the bowels of the Facebook empire. Follow all the latest news from one of the biggest deals in tech history so far.  WhatsApp just announced that its messaging app is now used by 500 million people around the world. And those are all described as ""regular, active"" users, another sign of the company's soaring growth — and the loyalty of its community.

Facebook's $16 billion buyout of WhatsApp last month was quickly followed by speculation about privacy for the app's more than 450 million users, given Facebook's own checkered history with privacy.

Announced on February 19th, Facebook's $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp was a deal sealed between the two company CEOs a few days earlier, though it took years of amicable courtship to reach the accord.

It all started with an email from Zuckerberg in the spring of 2012 and culminated with an accepted takeover offer on the Facebook boss' couch a... Plenty have been wondering what's next for WhatsApp after the popular messaging service was purchased by Facebook for $16 billion last week, and now we have the answer: voice calls. According to TechCrunch, WhatsApp announced during a Mobile World Congress event today that it would be adding voice services to iOS and Android during the second quarter of the year. The feature will reportedly head to Nokia devices and BlackBerrys sometime after that.  While unlikely to become a movie, WhatsApp's $16 billion-plus sale to Facebook yesterday marks one of the biggest tech deals ever, and one that bears some resemblance to the working class success stories told by Horatio Alger. A new feature story in Forbes chronicles how co-founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton managed to do it all while squeaking by in WhatsApp's early days, and for Koum long before that. The short version: it wasn't easy. When Mark Zuckerberg says he wants to ""connect the world’s people,"" it’s not some gentle, humanist statement. Zuckerberg intends to own the communications layer of the world we live in — if today’s $16-plus billion acquisition of messaging service WhatsApp is any indication.

Sequoia Capital reportedly invested a mere $8 million in WhatsApp back in 2011 — and while startups commonly raise subsequent rounds of funding amongst several investors, WhatsApp never announced any additional funding. Simply sticking with that initial investor would be striking, but it's even more arresting in light of the payoff. The percentage of WhatsApp owned by Sequoia has been kept under wraps, but sources tell us it lands somewhere between 10 and 20 percent — meaning Sequoia could be reaping as much as $3.2 billion in cash and stock for that initial investment. It's a huge win for the firm, and makes other recent deals — Instagram reportedly closed a $50 million round of funding right before Facebook acquired it for $1 billion, for example — look puny in comparison.  ""In terms of value creation, this is the biggest on record."" ""In terms of value creation, this is the biggest on record,"" says Anand Sanwal, CEO of venture capital tracking firm CB Insights. eBay, long considered one of the great venture capital stories, raised $6.7 million and was valued at $1.9 billion after its IPO. Today's announcement also makes the the news that Snapchat turned down a $3 billion offer from Facebook seem a lot less shocking than it did at the time. Ironically, just this past December WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum told the Wall Street Journal that the company had no intention of selling, going public, or raising new funding — a stance it was able to maintain because it wasn't spending money on extraneous expenses like marketing. ""That will allow our company to stay independent,"" he said at the time. With $16 billion in the equation, however, it appears that became a very different story — and depending on where Facebook's stock goes in the months and years ahead, the number could soar even higher. Update: Fortune reports that Sequoia may have ultimately invested as much as $60 million in WhatsApp, which might be a larger amount than the company publicly reported, but does nothing to change the epic scale of Sequoia's financial win.

The past year has been marked by a landmark legal case that struck down the 2010 Open Internet rules, and a series of polarizing proposals for new ones. Protestors have driven a record number of comments to the FCC; this morning, a group blocked off Chairman Tom Wheeler's driveway to decry the latest series of rules. And now, President Barack Obama has urged the FCC to take a stand and treat broadband more like a utility than a web portal. Obama's loose four-point proposal is a boon to most net neutrality supporters: he's asking for broadband to be classified as a Title II common carrier, putting it in the same category as telephone service. Not only would the plan revive bans on ISPs blocking content, it would also prevent them from slowing down some services or speeding up others — the so-called ""fast lanes"" that have become a primary point of contention in this debate. It would extend net neutrality protections, in some cases, to the backbone connections between services like Netflix and ISPs, not just ISPs and consumers. It even asks for the rules to apply to mobile broadband as much as possible, a major shift away from the laissez-faire policies in the 2010 Open Internet Order. To forestall critics, it allows for what's known as ""forbearance,"" a process in which the FCC chooses not to enforce certain parts of Title II. But as Obama himself admits, this isn't his call to make. The FCC is currently drafting its net neutrality proposals, and he has no control over how its five commissioners ultimately vote. After taking both houses of Congress in the midterm elections, Republicans are poised to overrule the FCC and ban net neutrality regulation. In this climate, what can a speech from the President actually do? ""Obamacare for the internet"" Obama has always said he's in favor of net neutrality, but he notably waited until after the midterm elections to make his support for Title II reclassification known. He's entering the lame-duck period of his presidency, where political fallout is more limited — although he's going to face harsh criticism from telecommunications companies and conservatives. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) has already called the proposal ""Obamacare for the internet,"" and Verizon said it would be ""a radical reversal of course."" But he's throwing weight behind the position of Democrats like House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who called for Title II reclassification in September, and standing up in opposition to Republicans like Cruz and Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH), one of several members of Congress who's tried to stop net neutrality before. ""It's fair to see this as a preemptive strike in the coming legislative battle,"" says Geoffrey Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law and Economics. ""There's already significant interest on the Hill in passing legislation to rein in the FCC on net neutrality, whether as part of a Communications Act rewrite or a standalone bill. The White House statement certainly makes it harder to get Democratic votes behind such an effort, and signals very clearly (although this was probably already obvious) that the White House would veto a bill that takes Title II off the table."" For Berin Szoka, president of anti-reclassification advocacy group TechFreedom, this is a major mistake. ""Obama's statement is simply a cynical political ploy, a way of playing to activists on the radical Left who have built mailing lists and a political movement on the most absolutist conception of net neutrality,"" he says. The debate over how to apply rules under Title II ""will only be politicized even further by Obama's inflammatory rhetoric."" As such, it could make reaching a Congressional agreement on net neutrality and FCC reform — both of which have been a topic of debate for years — harder. ""The ball's in their court in a way it hasn't been before."" Tim Karr, strategy director of the pro-net neutrality group Free Press, thinks this might be inevitable. ""Unfortunately, it seems like anything Obama says tends to create a level of polarization,"" he says. Republicans are currently planning a multi-year overhaul of the FCC's rule-making powers, with the goal of getting Obama to sign a bill before leaving office. At the helm is Senator John Thune (R-SD), who promotes a ""light regulatory touch"" that emphatically excludes strengthening net neutrality rules. Thune has issued a statement condemning Obama's ""stale thinking,"" which he says would create legal and economic problems and extend ""what has needlessly become a politically corrosive policy debate."" For now, Congress is less important than the FCC, and Karr thinks Obama's statement is a limited but much-needed nudge. The statement ""puts the onus squarely on the head of Chairman Wheeler and the two Democratic commissioners,"" he says. ""The debate has shifted now, I think, to not whether the FCC uses Title II or not, but how the FCC uses Title II."" Tim Wu, known for coining net neutrality as a term, says that ""the ball's in their court in a way it hasn't been before. ... He's the boss; he's the head of the Democratic Party and the President of the United States. His ideas hold a lot of weight."" Fight for the Future (and signatories of multiple online petitions) asked Obama to fire Tom Wheeler if he doesn't support reclassification, but that's a far less likely prospect — removing an FCC head for making a disagreeable policy call would set a terrible political precedent, and it probably wouldn't get critics a fiercer replacement. The FCC confirmed that it's looking at unpopular ""hybrid"" plans As it stands, the FCC's response has been fairly noncommittal. ""As an independent regulatory agency we will incorporate the President's submission into the record of the Open Internet proceeding,"" it said. It even used its statement to confirm that it's been looking at unpopular ""hybrid"" plans, which only apply Title II rules to certain parts of the web. It's unclear whether we'll see a net neutrality rule in place by the end of this year, and the statement emphasized how complicated the process is going to be. If the FCC votes to accept Obama's plan, commissioners will still have to create a real policy. What parts of Title II, like price regulations, shouldn't apply to broadband internet? How should the rules for wireless and wired internet differ? Jon Peha, a Carnegie Mellon University professor and former assistant director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, says it's the details that will determine whether the proposal is ""useful or dangerous."" Among other things, he says, the FCC will need to make sure it's tailored rules to allow very specific kinds of useful discrimination without compromising the larger framework. ""We don't want to prohibit carriers from blocking viruses, for example."" No matter what they come up with, there's a long road ahead. Any version of net neutrality is probably going to draw lawsuits from companies like Verizon, which successfully managed to overturn the 2010 rules almost a year ago. If Title II is in the mix, opposition will be even stronger. Regardless of how much or little Obama can directly control, though, he's instantly raised the public profile of net neutrality. And he's come out in favor of the most dramatic policy change on the table... or, at least, the skeleton of one. It's up to the FCC to flesh it out.",0.500597704820321,0.49940229517967905,0.8761577919651241,1261,5.0222045995241871,626,6.3769968051118209,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

But while the basics are simple, there's lots to understand underneath the surface, so I called Tim Wu, the man who originally coined the phrase ""net neutrality,"" for some quick insight. Here's our conversation, lightly edited for clarity. So what's your first take on the news? ""It takes someone who's not deep in the game to say this is the obvious thing"" Well, the President has gone all in. He's taken a look at it and said, ""Why are we doing these half measures?"" Why not just do the most obvious thing, which is a bright line net neutrality rule using the strongest authority the agency has? I don't understand why we would do anything else."" I think it was bold and courageous and, in some ways, just obvious. But sometimes, it takes someone who's not deeply embedded in the game to say this is the obvious thing to do to. So will the FCC actually do it? Do I think the FCC will do what he says? The ball's in their court in a way it hasn't been before. I certainly think it stands a chance. He's the boss; he's the head of the Democratic Party and the President of the United States. His ideas hold a lot of weight. Obviously, [the FCC] is not going to just ignore this; they have more political cover to do it. I don't think it's the Chairman's preference, but knowing that he'll have the White House... They may find themselves very isolated. Sometimes, you have to pick a side or get run over. ""Sometimes, you have to pick a side or get run over"" What's the point of being in the middle if you're the FCC at this point, unless you really think it's better in some way? If they stay in the middle, they're kind of naked right now — there's no one there with them. It's not like Congress is gonna help out. Congress is going to be against any version of the net neutrality rule, the tech companies are against any compromise. Sometimes, the middle can end up being a very dangerous place. The only concern I have is that there's too much chaos. My main concern is delay. Won't it take a long time to open a new process and go through it all? They already have a rulemaking process, though. If they want, they could do this in December... though, it's getting tight; they have to circulate something by November 19th. The odds of delay have more than doubled, which could mean that Comcast gets more tied up in this whole story. Is Comcast cruising towards approval [of the Time Warner purchase] at this point? I wouldn't say that's so. I just think that Comcast becomes part of the story since the Comcast merger will happen in January, too. Comcast is in more trouble than you think. ""Comcast is in more trouble than you think."" I think Comcast has made net neutrality feel a little more visceral and a little less hypothetical. The truth is that there have been way more comments on net neutrality after the Comcast merger. We live in a world of both cultural and political subcultures, and when people get fired up about things, they get fired up, and net neutrality is one of those issues. I would not underestimate the strength of the interest in net neutrality and that people care about it. The fact that Barack Obama took the time to do the video and the proposed rules attracted four million comments is, in some ways, a coming-of-age for the issue. This is really just the same plan Genachowski proposed in 2010, right? Go to Title II, forebear what you don't like, get it done. Why did it fail then? Yep, that's right, that's what it is. Genachowski's failure was not a failure of law, it was a failure of will. They were unable to pull the trigger, so they went for the compromise...and then that blew up. This time, Obama's saying, ""Just pull the trigger."" ""The President has done his job."" If there's somebody who's interested in this, what are the next steps? I guess, first of all, commend the White House and do everything you can to put pressure on the FCC to listen to the President if you care about this issue. Tell them to listen to the President. I agree 100 percent with everything the President said, and I'm a net neutrality advocate. There's no hole in the plan — this is net neutrality. The President has done his job.

The foul-mouthed executive — known for dropping f-bombs during corporate events and wearing magenta Chucks in place of wingtips — bedevils his bigger rivals at every opportunity, wielding Twitter like a blunt weapon. But for all the bluster, Legere actually agrees with his competition on a key point: he thinks that the FCC is at risk of harming competition by stifling the internet with ""overzealous regulation.""  Don’t let the gov’t kill innovation. It has made us the fastest growing wireless company in America. #netneutrality  Keep the Internet open but don’t let the FCC kill competition with overzealous regulation. #netneutrality  The tweet, of course, is a response to President Obama's message earlier today that he was in full support of Title II regulation of the internet, a move that would allow the FCC to enforce its court-defeated Open Internet rules ensuring that traffic is treated equally and ISPs can't prioritize certain content providers over others. The whole thing puts Legere in an awkward position. True net neutrality, the kind that would be enforceable under Title II regulation, is broadly recognized as the consumer-friendly approach: no one who pays for internet service wants to live in a world where their ISPs have the authority to block or slow certain content providers (say, for the sake of argument, Netflix) over business disputes or pay-for-play. And Legere, perhaps more than any other executive in tech, loves playing the role of the People's Executive. But here's the thing: any company that provides internet access is naturally averse to regulation, because regulation generally limits unbounded profiteering in favor of consumer friendliness. And more specifically, a pure and complete interpretation of net neutrality would endanger the legality of T-Mobile's Music Freedom feature, which exempts certain streaming music services from data plans. Yet, Legere includes the #netneutrality hashtag in his tweet. It's classic regulatory doublespeak, redoubled by Legere's need to keep up appearances. There's really nothing ""uncarrier"" about it. The fact is, real net neutrality requires pretty serious regulation. So which is it, Mr. Legere: do you want net neutrality, or do you want to underwrite the same ""light regulatory touch"" espoused by the very companies you blast for their anti-consumer policies seven days a week? No matter — mere minutes later, Legere was right back to blasting AT&T for not looking out for its customers: .@ATT abandons in-flight connectivity?! Guess their cust won’t get free in-flight voicemail and SMS like ours do! http://t.co/hDLEbyPg5f  Shortly afterwards, in response to this article, Legere took to Twitter again to issue a series of tweets that attempted to clarify his position. He landed on the same talking points adopted by many wireline and wireless internet providers over the past few months, chiefly that the far more limited authority granted by Section 706 is preferable to the sweeping authority available under Title II. He also reiterated that he believes in ""no blocking"" and ""no discrimination,"" which is problematic: Music Freedom literally discriminates between packets to decide which of them count against your data bucket.

Obama released a statement urging the FCC to reclassify broadband as a utility. In doing so, he answered the call of millions of people who've written the Commission and chairman Tom Wheeler in support of reclassification, which many view as the most sure fire way of keeping the internet open and shielded from the profit-driven interests of ISPs. Obama's message was a huge boost for net neutrality advocates, but it's unclear how much impact it'll have in the long term; figuring out net neutrality is the FCC's job, and reclassification would require a GOP-controlled US Congress to play along. Even so, when the President of the United States speaks up, his words carry serious weight. We've collected some early reactions to Obama's plan, and more important voices are likely to chime in throughout the day. Much of the feedback is predictable and calculated, but we're already seeing some head-scratchers. And should the FCC decide to follow Obama's lead, major ISPs have made it clear they're prepared to sue and take this debate to court. Emphasis in below quotations added by The Verge. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler: The President’s statement is an important and welcome addition to the record of the Open Internet proceeding. Like the President, I believe that the Internet must remain an open platform for free expression, innovation, and economic growth. We both oppose Internet fast lanes. The Internet must not advantage some to the detriment of others. We cannot allow broadband networks to cut special deals to prioritize Internet traffic and harm consumers, competition and innovation. As an independent regulatory agency we will incorporate the President’s submission into the record of the Open Internet proceeding. We welcome comment on it and how it proposes to use Title II of the Communications Act. In January, a federal court struck down rules that prevented Internet Service Providers from blocking and discriminating against online content. In May, the Commission sought comment on how to best reinstate these rules to protect consumers and innovators online while remaining within the parameters of the legal roadmap the court established. The goal was simple: to reach the outcomes sought by the 2010 rules. We sought comment on using Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act, as discussed by the court to protect what the court described as the ""virtuous circle"" of innovation that fosters broadband deployment and protects consumers. The purpose of the Commission’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposal was to elicit comments. In the past several months, we’ve heard from millions of Americans from across the country. From the beginning I have pledged to finally bring to an end the years-long quest for rules that are upheld in court. In May we sought comment on both Section 706 and Title II and I promised that in this process all options would be on the table in order to identify the best legal approach to keeping the Internet open. That includes both the Section 706 option and the Title II reclassification. Recently, the Commission staff began exploring ""hybrid"" approaches, proposed by some members of Congress and leading advocates of net neutrality, which would combine the use of both Title II and Section 706. The more deeply we examined the issues around the various legal options, the more it has become plain that there is more work to do. The reclassification and hybrid approaches before us raise substantive legal questions. We found we would need more time to examine these to ensure that whatever approach is taken, it can withstand any legal challenges it may face. For instance, whether in the context of a hybrid or reclassification approach, Title II brings with it policy issues that run the gamut from privacy to universal service to the ability of federal agencies to protect consumers, as well as legal issues ranging from the ability of Title II to cover mobile services to the concept of applying forbearance on services under Title II. I am grateful for the input of the President and look forward to continuing to receive input from all stakeholders, including the public, members of Congress of both parties, including the leadership of the Senate and House committees, and my fellow commissioners. Ten years have passed since the Commission started down the road towards enforceable Open Internet rules. We must take the time to get the job done correctly, once and for all, in order to successfully protect consumers and innovators online. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH): Republicans will continue our efforts to stop this misguided scheme to regulate the #Internet: http://t.co/O7yNrTZoQs #jobs  It’s disappointing, but not surprising, that the Obama administration continues to disregard the people’s will and push for more mandates on our economy.   An open, vibrant Internet is essential to a growing economy, and net neutrality is a textbook example of the kind of Washington regulations that destroy innovation and entrepreneurship. Federal bureaucrats should not be in the business of regulating the Internet – not now, not ever. In the new Congress, Republicans will continue our efforts to stop this misguided scheme to regulate the Internet, and we’ll work to encourage private-sector job creation, starting with many of the House-passed jobs bills that the outgoing Senate majority ignored. Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) Thank you Mr.President @WhiteHouse for standing w fellow netizens in support of #NetNeutrality http://t.co/th4vzXexc5 pic.twitter.com/RXS7pTxTh1 Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) ""Net Neutrality"" is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government.    Senator John Thune (R-SD): The president’s call for the FCC to use Title II to create new net neutrality restrictions would turn the Internet into a government-regulated utility and stifle our nation’s dynamic and robust Internet sector with rules written nearly 80 years ago for plain old telephone service. The president’s stale thinking would invite legal and marketplace uncertainty and perpetuate what has needlessly become a politically corrosive policy debate. Nancy Pelosi: I applaud President Obama’s leadership on #NetNeutrality. We must ensure fair & equal access to the Internet! http://t.co/g87LMKT67c  Comcast: Comcast fully embraces the open Internet principles that the President and the Chairman of the FCC have espoused -- transparency, no blocking, non-discrimination rules, and no ""fast lanes"", which is the way we operate our network today.  We continue to believe, however, that section 706 provides more than ample authority to impose those rules, as the DC Circuit made clear. Comcast and cable companies (along with the telcos) have led the broadband revolution, being the first to roll out America’s fastest broadband speeds across the country.  As the White House itself acknowledged in its broadband report in 2013, this only happened because we were not subject to the intrusive regulatory regime designed for a different era. To attempt to impose a full-blown Title II regime now, when the classification of cable broadband has always been as an information service, would reverse nearly a decade of precedent, including findings by the Supreme Court that this classification was proper. This would be a radical reversal that would harm investment and innovation, as today's immediate stock market reaction demonstrates.  And such a radical reversal of consistent contrary precedent should be taken up by the Congress. The internet has not just appeared by accident or gift — it has been built by companies like ours investing and building networks and infrastructure. The policy the White House is encouraging would jeopardize this engine for job creation and investment as well as the innovation cycle that the Internet has generated. Verizon: Verizon supports the open Internet, and we continue to believe that the light-touch regulatory approach in place for the past two decades has been central to the Internet’s success. Reclassification under Title II, which for the first time would apply 1930s-era utility regulation to the Internet, would be a radical reversal of course that would in and of itself threaten great harm to an open Internet, competition and innovation. That course will likely also face strong legal challenges and would likely not stand up in court. Moreover, this approach would be gratuitous. As all major broadband providers and their trade groups have conceded, the FCC already has sufficient authority under Section 706 to adopt rules that address any practices that threaten harm to consumers or competition, including authority to prohibit ‘paid prioritization.’ For effective, enforceable, legally sustainable net neutrality rules, the Commission should look to Section 706."" AT&T: Today’s announcement by the White House, if acted upon by the FCC, would be a mistake that will do tremendous harm to the Internet and to U.S. national interests. It is a complete reversal of a bipartisan policy that has been in place since the Clinton Administration—namely, to treat Internet access as an information service subject to light-touch regulation.  This classification of Internet service has been upheld by the Supreme Court and has enjoyed strong Congressional support for nearly a generation.  Now, with one statement, the White House is telling the FCC to ignore this precedent and to instead impose on the entire Internet—from end to end— onerous government regulation designed in the 1930s for a Bell phone monopoly that no longer exists, not for a 21st century technology.  This will have a negative impact not only on investment and innovation, but also on our economy overall. For a generation, the Internet has been an American success story.  Light-touch regulation has encouraged levels of investment unprecedented by any industry and spawned incredible innovation.  Today’s action puts all of that at risk – and puts it at risk not to remedy any specific harm that has occurred.  Instead, this action is designed to deal with a hypothetical problem posed by certain political groups whose objective all along has been to bring about government control of the Internet.  The White House is proposing to put the Internet and our economy at risk as a result of such political pressures. We feel the actions called for by the White House are inconsistent with decades of legal precedent as well as Congressional intent.  Moreover, if the government were going to make such a momentous decision as regulating the entire Internet like a public utility, that decision is more properly made by the Congress and not by unelected regulators without any public record to support the change in regulation.  If the FCC puts such rules in place, we would expect to participate in a legal challenge to such action. USTelecom: The president’s call for public utility regulation of the Internet, a shift that will redefine the Internet, insert the government deeply into its management and invite other countries to do the same, is contrary to the best interests of the nation and America’s technology future. At a time when broadband providers are operating in conformance with the very open Internet principles that the president supports, it is baffling why he would risk continued broadband investment, deployment, economic growth and job creation by asking the FCC to reverse course on the very successful bipartisan policy that has now been in place for more than a decade. The court has indicated that the objectives the president seeks can be achieved under the light touch regulatory approach of Title I, and there is a broad consensus on the goals. Such a radical shift in the legal foundation for broadband Internet services will bring strong legal challenges from across the broadband industry. We hope the commissioners will be careful to consider the president’s proposal in the context of their statutory responsibility to act independently, and we look forward to continuing to work with them toward achieving a result that is consistent with both the president’s objectives and the law.

President Obama has chosen to stand with the us: the users, the innovators, the creators who depend on an open internet. But the fight isn't over yet: we still need to persuade the FCC to join him. Common Cause: The President wasn't kidding when he said he'd take a back seat to no one on net neutrality. Thank you, Mr. President. And thanks to the millions of Americans who helped make this happen. As someone who has been pushing for Title II since 2002, when the FCC wrongly classified broadband, I am thrilled. Now the FCC must show the same kind of leadership and courage. Fight for the Future: Thanks to the second largest online protest in history, nearly 4 million comments, White House & FCC phone lines ringing off the hook, and even nationwide street protests, President Obama finally gets it, and can say so. He sees why net neutrality matters so much to the world’s future. He gets why Americans are furious at the prospect of cable companies controlling what we read, watch, and build online. He knows how important it is that smartphone users be treated equally. And he understands in policy terms that Title II reclassification–far from being a radical step–is simply a recognition of how essential the Internet has become, to all of us. Broadband for America: President Barack Obama's endorsement of 1930's era Title II classification would lead to unprecedented government interference in the Internet and would hurt consumers and innovation.  Further, for the President to issue this directive is a threat to the independence of the FCC itself.  By vastly expanding the regulatory bureaucracy over the Internet, the administration is turning its back on 20 years of bipartisan consensus that has allowed the Internet to flourish. The President's approach would threaten millions of jobs and a diverse array of stakeholders including, labor, civil-rights organization, and tech companies, who have long advocated for a far more restrained approach. Further, the President's directive discredits US efforts to prevent countries like Russia and China from destroying the current international multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance and replacing it with government regulatory control.  It is ironic that the President made his announcement while in China, which has long sought greater government control over the Internet and surely will be encouraged by the President's statement. We urge FCC Chairman Wheeler to exercise his independent authority and reject this extreme proposal. blockquote p {margin-bottom: 15px!important;}",0.7655827376433356,0.23441726235666438,0.8675245131220786,2487,5.299557700040209,1024,7.0478515625,0,0,"Policy & Law, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Today, President Obama abandoned his hands-off approach by strongly urging the agency to adopt the most rigorous provisions of the Telecommunications Act, which would regulate internet providers more like the public utilities they actually are. That involvement will come at a cost; Obama's closeness to the issue has already prompted rebuttals from Republican leaders who thrive on painting anything Obama does as nothing short of a total government takeover. One of those Republicans is prominent Tea Party member and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who quickly responded to the president's statement this morning by saying ""'net neutrality' is Obamacare for the internet."" This statement is utterly meaningless to people who understand both the Affordable Care Act and net neutrality policy, and it makes Ted Cruz look like an idiot. But Ted Cruz isn't an idiot; equating net neutrality with Obamacare is a thick brush stroke in the art of political manipulation. ""If you want real 'net neutrality' I suggest you move to China, you idiot!"" If you don't believe me, take a look at this email I received from a reader, shortly after I criticized Cruz's comments this morning: Do you not realize ""net neutrality"" as proposed by Obama is an attempt to limit free speech?  Did you not watch the White House proposing to put government regulators in the editorial offices of newspapers to ""monitor and advise"" the newspapers on content? Did you not observe the same ""fairness"" proposals as they related to talk radio in an attempt to stifle free speech, especially opposition to leftist/statist orthodoxy, and ignore market forces concerning what listeners want? If you want real ""net neutrality"" I suggest you move to China where all Internet traffic is censored by the government. I will say it once again---you idiot! Or this one: Ted Cruz postion on government intrusion into the private sector is consistent and supported by those of us who love liberty and freedom from an encroaching too big government.  Whether it is seizing 1/6 of the nations economy like the disastrous obamacare of the governmental regulation of the internet  (what next radio and then press?).  It is obvious you have either misread the will of the vast majority of the voters from the elections last week or you wish to push your liberal agenda on those who read your piece - or both! Neither of these missives indicate a basic grasp of the principles of net neutrality or facts about the internet marketplace. They are raw, emotional responses to something Republicans hate (government takeovers!) and the leader who will crush us under the weight of liberal bureaucracy (Obama!). All you need to do to win an election in some parts of the United States is to compare something or someone to Obamacare. But Republicans should be wary of that kind of cynical heresthetic. Lumping net neutrality in with big government is not only internally inconsistent, it doesn't represent authentic conservative values. Opposition to net neutrality from GOP leadership (and also from some Democrats) has so far reflected the interests of the powerful telecommunications lobby. Conservative voters actually have compelling reasons to break from the Republican party's rhetoric and should support net neutrality and reclassification of ISPs as public utilities. Here are some of them.   Free markets are great in theory because they allow people to decide for themselves the kind of products and services they want, and the consequence is that businesses will compete for their attention by making the best possible stuff at the lowest possible price. So it makes sense that Republicans would want broadband internet to be sold with as little interference as possible from the government. There's just one huge, glaring problem: there's actually no meaningful competition in the broadband market. ""None. Zero. Nothing. It is a wasteland."" The market is fundamentally broken; people can't make real choices about who to buy internet from. In a lot of places, your only option is Comcast. Regulating broadband like a utility will provide more options for consumers and make the broadband market more like the ideal kind of market conservatives value.     Republican leaders have given dire warnings this year that net neutrality regulations will stifle innovation and kill jobs. Incidentally, this is a key talking point from major ISPs. But so far there's been no evidence that net neutrality will create net job losses. ISPs, they argue, will have less incentive to make network investments that improve broadband service. But this point is actually completely counter-intuitive — unless the broadband market is completely broken. (It is.) In a competitive market, businesses invest money to make service better and cheaper because they have to if they want to survive. Nobody was talking about gigabit internet until Google Fiber lit a fire under their ass. In fact, there are several companies and municipalities that have tried to make investments in high-speed broadband but were rebuffed or intimidated by incumbent ISPs. AT&T, Comcast, and Time Warner Cable have all used the state to curb competitors.     Monopolies are as much of a threat to free markets as meddlesome governments, but monopolies can't really exist without the government's help; ironically, killing net neutrality will do more damage to the free market by preserving a status quo that already transfers massive amounts of wealth and power from the government to just a few companies. So far these companies have been reined in slightly by net neutrality rules, which prevent them from completely manipulating who gets to use the internet and how they use it. Mobile internet, for example, relies on doling out precious bands of the electromagnetic spectrum to companies that build and operate networks. Spectrum is a finite resource managed by the government, and ISPs like Verizon and AT&T have dominated the market by cornering spectrum sales and wielding huge influence over how their networks can be used. Consumers can't make useful decisions that will have real impacts on ISPs if the providers are powerful enough to ignore their preferences. In the case of wireless networks like Verizon and AT&T, many upstart competitors are literally locked out because of the laws of physics.     The great irony of net neutrality becoming a partisan issue is that it is, by its very definition, about creating a level playing field that doesn't discriminate against types of expression. Net neutrality is just that: neutral. Net neutrality is nothing like, as one of those emails I received had insinuated, the so-called ""Fairness Doctrine"" — an FCC policy that required the holders of broadcast licenses to present competing views on issues of public importance. Republicans have rightly blasted recent efforts to revive this kind of policy for being a heavy-handed form of governmental interference in the marketplace of ideas. Net neutrality is actually the opposite of something like the Fairness Doctrine. The fundamental principle of net neutrality is equality: the idea that all information being carried on the network should be treated the same. It means that data coming from Senator Ted Cruz's website should be treated exactly the same as data coming from President Obama's website, and that companies like Verizon and Comcast shouldn't manipulate how that data is delivered.     The only companies that will face a squeeze from utility-style regulation are monopolistic ISPs. So far, these companies have used government bodies at the state and federal level to expand their holdings, maximize profits, and stifle competitors. By establishing some ground rules and making ISPs subject to common carrier regulations, these companies won't be able to manipulate vague statutes for competitive advantage. For instance, Verizon has played the FCC and its customers by arguing against Title II regulation as ""ancient"" and unwieldy while at the same time claiming it is a utility in order to receive government benefits.     Even Adam Smith favored government expense on public works that facilitated commerce. The internet has been compared to the Interstate Highway System for great reasons: it's a system of communication and transportation that has created enormous wealth and opportunity. There's an enormous public interest in government-provided internet service, and some municipalities are trying to make it a reality, even though huge ISPs are trying to stop them. But net neutrality isn't even a government-provided service like the highway system. It's just a set of rules that allows private companies to profit from providing essential services while protecting consumers and the vast majority of businesses from manipulative, anti-competitive behavior. ISPs argue that they provide all of the innovation and investment in the internet, but they're not what makes the internet special. Businesses large and small, from Facebook to Airbnb, make the internet what it is. Net neutrality has allowed them to start, to compete, and to prosper — all because consumers can largely make decisions based on cost and merit rather than what Comcast or AT&T prefer.",0.4215548281384507,0.5784451718615493,0.17947119404029732,1517,5.1746868820039555,716,6.6159217877094969,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Editorial",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

""Vaping has never been shown on a TV advert in the UK before, so this is a first for the country and I’m sure it will be a real conversation starter!"" Dave Levin, VIP co-founder says in a statement.  ""Our commitment is to make sure they are advertised in a responsible way."" The UK banned the advertisement of cigarettes back in 1965. It's still been possible to advertise e-cigarettes before now, but there was still a ban on actually depicting the device or the act of smoking. Now, both are able to be depicted, albeit subject to a number of restrictions. That includes bans from making ads that appeal to anyone under 18, banning the depiction of anyone who is or appears to be younger than 25, and banning the encouragement of any non-smokers to begin using an e-cig. ""We’ve moved quickly to put in place appropriate and clear regulation around e-cigarette advertising,"" Shahriar Coupal, director of the UK's Committee of Advertising Practice, says in a statement. ""While the debate about e-cigarettes continues our commitment is to make sure they are advertised in a responsible way and that children are protected."" This rule change doesn't just apply to TV ads: they will apply across other forms of media in the UK too. After one year, the agency will conduct a review of the rules and their effect on the public. There's been an ongoing debate around the benefits and harms of e-cigs, with major health organizations announcing various levels of support and opposition. The World Health Organization has called for a ban on indoor use of e-cigs and fruity flavors — much like the bans on traditional cigarettes — while the American Heart Association believes that e-cigs are a good way to help people quit. There's not quite a consensus yet on the health impact of vaping. VIP intends to continue airing the ad, in both 10- and 20-second versions, over the next five weeks. They'll all air later in the evening, when content that's deemed inappropriate for kids is allowed to be shown. The allowing these ads actually go into effect today, so VIP is getting into e-cig advertising as soon as possible. It isn't really hiding that its interest is, in part, in stirring up controversy around that too. Levin says, ""It will be interesting to see how people respond to our advert’s debut this evening.""

If the best they can continue to come up with is repeating ""Obama is bad!"" the internet is in serious trouble. Net neutrality is obviously nothing like Obamacare, but Cruz and his colleagues have already demonstrated they either don't understand what internet freedom means or they're willing to spread mendacious propaganda about it to help their friends at Verizon, Comcast, and other monopolistic ISPs. Washington is mired in partisanship. Since 2008, the electorate has been subjected to an endless rhetorical tug-of-war between the GOP and Obama, who has become a remarkable manifestation of Republican fears projected on the national stage. Unfortunately, that means even rational policies that ought to be uncontroversial can become tainted by mere association with the president. If Cruz's comments today are a sneak peek at Republican opposition to net neutrality for the next two years, we'll be in for a rough ride.

Only one man can save the world — the eponymous Kung Fury — and you can now see his escapades in their entirety on YouTube after its TV debut. After being bitten by a cobra and struck by lightning at the same time as his police partner was chopped in half by a sword-wielding kung fu master, Kung Fury is working as a cop in 1985-era Miami. The city has kept its palm trees and beaches, but has changed in other, fairly notable ways. Everything's bathed in a pink or orange neon light, for one, and there's a huge shaolin temple rising high above the ground that residents might not recognize. That temple is Kung Fury's home, but he doesn't stay there long. His mission takes him on a quest through cyberspace, before ending in a climatic showdown in a secret underground bunker that pits dinosaurs, Norse gods, and cyborg hackers against Hitler and an army of his gas-masked goons.  The result is particularly impressive considering director and star David Sandberg doesn't actually know any kung fu. Certainly, any shortcomings in his technique are covered up with liberal use of modern visual effects, or wiped away with tracking errors and frequent interruptions of fuzz, making it look like the movie's been copied straight from a VHS. Just in case it couldn't get any more '80s, Sandberg also secured the services of David Hasselhoff for the movie's theme song, the synth-heavy slice of retro pop that is ""True Survivor.""",0.5997789053945586,0.4002210946054414,0.8356809659703949,297,4.808080808080808,209,5.6459330143540667,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Watch This",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Even today, it's thinner and lighter than the newest iPhone, it feels sturdy, and it comes in some vibrant colors. But the 2012 iPod touch had one truly questionable design decision: the loop. The ""loop"" — Apple terminology for ""wristband"" — came with every iPod touch and attached to a strange little nub that could pop in and out of the iPod's body.  You can watch Apple explain the loop in the video below, which features one of the most apathetic keynote performances it's ever given.  Does this guy care about the loop? I don't get the impression he does. Apple said the loop was made ""for that added security when you're taking pictures or just walking around town."" Maybe Apple was thinking that it'd be great for kids, or maybe Apple was thinking that we were all too clumsy to hold the iPod touch's body because it's just so thin. Did anyone actually use the loop? Our review of the 2012 iPod touch included around 70 words on the strap, ending with: ""I promptly forgot it existed."" Seemingly, so did Apple. It eventually stopped including the loop with 16GB models of the touch, which means most buyers probably didn't end up with one.

Around 2010, I subscribed to Amazon Prime. In New York, where I lived at the time, shopping meant sacrificing time and energy at the altar of commerce, first to hoof it to the store, then lug whatever back to the apartment and up however many floors into your room. The nearest Best Buy was a mile and a half away, with no direct subway line. Amazon Prime delivered for free — minus the annual cost of the subscription, of course. In NYC, shopping meant sacrificing time and energy For most of my life, visiting Best Buy had been a habit bordering on an addiction. My mother worked Saturdays during my childhood, so my father and I would pass the first day of the weekend with a weekly pilgrimage to the only real electronics store near our Kansas City suburb. Like some act of devotion, we'd take the same stroll through the corridors of music, movies, and video games — slightly modified to add new stock and remove the old — and if I played my cards right, I'd leave with an old movie or game that had been marked down and tossed into a last-chance display bin. We attended church with my mother on Saturday evening, but those trips with my dad were their own spiritual experience. We didn't bond because of Best Buy, but Best Buy provided the set and setting. When I moved to New York, I'd often stroll to the Best Buy closest to my dorm because — and I know this must sound twisted to most people — the look and the smell reminded me of home. I went regularly enough that I even knew about the secret bathrooms: the one on the second floor by the video games, and the one in the basement way back behind the TV displays. I had no money as a college freshman, so I never bought anything. That didn't seem to bother the employees, many of whom were people I knew from the university. We didn't bond because of Best Buy; it provided the set and setting Eventually, I got busy. My home sickness faded. I found more entertaining things to do in New York City than hustle to an out-of-the-way electronics store in Soho. And if I really needed new headphones or a camera, I had the local J&R Electronics megaplex, a wall of electronics stores lining the street south of City Hall. As I grew older and had the opportunity to do more things — my childhood was limited to so many places: the mall, the movies, the neighborhood — shopping became an errand. Amazon Prime seemed to understand that the least interesting thing about a product is purchasing it. Buying games, movies, alarm clocks, suntan lotion, toilet paper, anything really became just that: a purchase.   There is no path to follow through Amazon each week. It is largely a singular and practical experience, minus the newly invented Prime Day and Black Friday, when the online store replicates the hysteria of brick-and-mortar. I don't miss shopping at Best Buy I now live in Texas, near a Best Buy, and have a car, which simplifies heading to the store on a whim. I've visited a few times, but whatever love I have for Best Buy — and most retail shopping — erodes when I enter the store and find it half empty, out of the memory card or charger or whatever else I need that day and can't just order online. I don't miss shopping at Best Buy. I do, however, sympathize with its employees, some of whom, like me, have some nostalgia for what the store once was. For the most part, I am grateful for the on-demand future that Amazon, along with companies like Netflix, FreshDirect, and Seamless, provides. But what I miss is the space to spend an afternoon in the air conditioning on the cheap. I miss all the giant book stores, where in high school I would buy philosophy books I couldn't comprehend, hoping to impress my friends while we sat outside and drank coffee as if we were imitating the great critics in French cafés. What I miss is the space Most of those places don't exist in my hometown — or in other cities across the country — any more, and I'm partly responsible for that. Because 90 percent of the time, it's just easier and cheaper to click Buy Now. When my parents visited me in college, I was too cool to go to a name brand store like Best Buy, so my dad and I would scour through the J&R complex in Lower Manhattan. It had everything: television, CDs, records, shower radios, PC games from decades ago. The complex was so sprawling we could spend an entire week inside and never see the sun. Last year, one by one, that row of J&R stores closed. I never made it downtown for its final week, but I was notified there would be a going-out-of-business sale online.",0.3951953321274413,0.6048046678725587,0.5169762725632893,860,4.4244186046511631,448,5.6116071428571432,0,2,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That’s why researchers are increasingly focused on determining which risk factors spur behaviors like binge drinking and alcohol addiction, as well as how they interact. But integrating all that information accurately hasn’t always been easy. Now, a study published today in Nature describes how researchers ""taught"" a computer to weigh the risk factors associated with teenage binge drinking using data from 14-year-olds. And the results, says lead study author and cognitive neuroscientist Robert Whelan, are promising: the computer was able to predict future adolescent binge drinkers with ""70 percent accuracy."" the model learns which features distinguish binge-drinkers In the study, Whelan and his colleagues linked data such as brain function, personality, life history, and genetics from hundreds of 14-year-olds who had participated in the IMAGEN project to their future alcohol use behaviors at the age of 16. This allowed the computer model to ""learn"" how over 40 different variables can influence future alcohol misuse. For example, the model learned that smoking at age 14 merits a relatively high weighting, whereas pubertal development status at age 14 doesn’t. ""It’s a form of supervised learning,"" Whelan says. ""You tell the computer what are the two groups — either binge drinker or not — and it has to learn what features best distinguish them."" Once the computer model had determined which factors were most important, researchers applied it to a new group of 14-years-olds and compared its results to what actually happened once the teens turned 16. ""Some people who aren’t binge drinkers were classified as binge drinkers, but overall, 70 percent were picked up correctly,"" says Whelan, who works at University College Dublin. ""We learned that predicting teenage binge drinking is possible,"" and ""we can be confident about that number."" ""predicting teenage binge drinking is possible."" About 10 percent of American 13- to 14-year-olds report drinking alcohol regularly, and that number nearly triples by age 16. This is worrisome, Whelan says, because early alcohol use is an important risk factor for alcoholism as an adult. But there’s hope, he says, because according to a 2001 study, early interventions can reduce the odds of adult alcohol dependence by 10 percent for each year that drinking behaviors are delayed in adolescents. That’s why Whelan thinks future models should also include factors like peer pressure, as measured through social media interactions, for instance. ""At the time the study was proposed — that’s probably going back to seven years ago — things like social media weren’t as prevalent,"" he says. ""If we had that information now, I’m pretty sure it would bump up that 70 percent."" Whelan also thinks that furthering genetic research will lead to stronger predictions. ""We know from familial studies that alcohol misuses and substance misuse has a strong genetic component but we don’t know much about the genes that drive that,"" he says. ""So in however many years, we might be able to make a dent in that."" But even if those predictions become stronger, they might not have immediate real-world applications, given the $1,000-per-participant price tag that comes with the inclusion of brain imaging. ""Brain imaging is very expensive to acquire and analyze,"" Whelan says. But it might still be possible to construct strong models without the brain imaging information, if researchers can use personality traits that overlap directly with what’s going on in the brain. ""Identifying future alcohol misuse with perfect accuracy may never be possible,"" Whelan says, but identifying teens who are at risk already is. ""Catching them so we can perform early interventions is really where this sort of research should be directed.""",0.7613759827324447,0.23862401726755533,0.8452361484205823,621,5.3896940418679549,345,6.3565217391304349,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

All the participants had to do was enter an empty room, sit down, and think for six to 15 minutes. But without a cellphone, a book, or a television screen to stare at, the assignment quickly became too much to handle. In fact, even when individuals were given time to ""prepare"" for being alone — meaning that they were able to plan what they would think about during their moments of solitude — the participants still ""found it hard,"" Timothy Wilson, a psychologist at the University of Virginia and lead author of the study, told The Washington Post. ""People didn’t like it much."" they could shock themselves as often as they liked So the researchers decided to give each participant the option of doing something else, besides just thinking. But what they came up with wasn’t exactly pleasant because, instead of just sitting there, participants were now also allowed to shock themselves as many times as they liked with a device containing a 9 volt battery. Still, for many, that option seemed like a better deal. Most of the people who decided to shock themselves did so seven times. These results baffled the researchers. ""I mean, no one was going to shock themselves by choice,"" Wilson, told The Washington Post in reference to his initial position during the conception of the study, published yesterday in Science. One man even gave himself 190 electric shocks over a period of 15 minutes, Wilson told The Atlantic, but his data points weren’t included in the final analysis. ""I’m still just puzzled by that."" One guy used the device 190 times Still, the fact that they chose to shock themselves at all, on their own, was unexpected. And this had nothing to do with curiosity about what the shocks would feel like, because the researchers made sure that each individual received a shock before the beginning of the session. Yet, people voluntarily shocking themselves repeatedly wasn’t the only surprise. According to the researchers, men showed a marked preference for the negative stimulation. Out of 24 women, only six decided to shock themselves, but 12 out of the 18 male participants figured electric shocks were worthwhile. This, the researchers hypothesize, might have to do with the fact that men appear to be more willing to take risks for the sake of an intense and complex experiences than women. The results of this study are tentative, however, and the sample sizes — a total of 11 experiments that included between 40 and 100 university students each — were fairly small, so researchers will need to repeat them.

Yet, that’s what one group of researchers appear to have achieved in a study published today in Human Brain Mapping. these effects are akin to what we experience when we dream In the experiment, researchers injected a dose of psilocybin — the chemical that gives ""shrooms"" their kick — into a group of 15 participants, reports The Washington Post. Another group, the control, didn’t receive the drug. Then, using brain imaging technology, the researchers looked at the areas of the brain that were activated in both groups. This allowed them to determine that psilocybin increased the volume of activity in regions of the brain that are usually activated when we dream, during sleep. It also increased brain function in regions that are associated with emotion and memory. According to the researchers, these effects are akin to what we experience when we dream. ""It’s like someone’s turned up the volume there, in these regions that are considered part of an emotional system in the brain,"" Robin Carhart-Harris, a neuropharmacologist at Imperial College London, told The Washington Post. ""When you look at a brain during dream sleep, you see the same hyperactive emotion centers."" Mushrooms dampen our egos Given that people who take psychedelics often describe their experiences as dreamlike (mushrooms don’t typically lead to the pleasant and rewarding ""highs"" that one might expect from other drugs), these findings might not seem surprising to some. But consider this: psilocybin didn’t just unlock emotion — it also decreased activity in parts of the brain that are associated with our sense of self, or our ego. This intriguing combination appears to allow users to consider their emotions in a different, broader, and often more positive light. As Carhart-Harris wrote in an article for The Conversation, this ""may explain why psychedelics have been considered useful facilitators of certain forms of psychotherapy."" The findings are completely novel, so their ""validity needs to be further tested,"" wrote Carhart-Harris.

The pill was officially endorsed by the CDC in May for use by any HIV negative person who may be at risk for infection (not just gay men who might be having sex with HIV positive partners) but this is the first time that a high-level elected official has recommended its use, reports The New York TImes. six years to reduce the number of new infections from 3,000 to 750 Currently about 3,000 new HIV infections are reported in New York state each year, but Cuomo wants that number reduced to 750 by 2020. To do so, he has introduced a three-prong strategy. The first two parts are rather traditional, as they rely on performing more HIV tests, and getting more people with positive tests to see physicians. But it’s the third part, the part that includes Truvada, that has the potential to cause a stir, because some people think it promotes lower rates of condom use. That statement, however, isn’t supported by a recent scientific study that looked into the matter. Moreover, in terms of preventing HIV, Truvada’s track record is pretty good. Recent reports state that it cuts infection rates by more than 90 percent, and people who take the drug every day are 99 percent protected from HIV. Furthermore, despite its $13,000-a-year price tag, the drug is covered by most insurers. So, its continued obscurity appears to have more to do with marketing than anything else. In truth, many people who are at risk for HIV still aren’t aware of the drug’s existence. And despite the CDC’s recent backing, its manufacturer, Gilead, has yet to market the drug for HIV prevention (Truvada is also used as part of a post HIV-exposure regimen). 99 percent protected from HIV infection This is why Cuomo’s announcement is so important. By backing the drug formally, and encouraging physicians to get the word out, he might actually bring it into the light and curb HIV infection rates. Of course, the announcement probably isn’t just about reducing infections. The pronouncement, which took place during Pride Weekend, is likely also an effort to win votes from members of the LGBTQ community. But when The Times' Josh Barro asked a top administration official about Cuomo’s decision to back the drug, the official answered in a surprisingly insightful — yet anonymous — manner about the issues at hand. ""Some people use condoms, some people don’t,"" the official told Barro. ""You can’t offer condoms to people who don’t want them."" improved access to something people might actually use That shouldn’t be seen as a sign that New York is abandoning its pro-condom strategy in favor of Truvada, however, since state guidelines make it clear that people who take the drug should still use condoms. But given the recent decline in condom use among teens of all sexual orientations, it’s likely that people will chose to take Truvada following Cuomo’s endorsement and who currently don't use condoms will continue to expose themselves to other STIs. So, the difference here is that although they might still become infected with treatable STIs, such as gonorrhea or chlamydia, they will have improved access to an effective, alternative form of HIV protection — one that they might actually use. Beside the Truvada endorsement, the state is also set to start enforcing a 2010 law that requires doctors to regularly offer HIV testing to patients between the ages of 13 and 65. And the state recently repealed a law that asked doctors and nurses to obtain written consent from patients before performing HIV tests, because the requirement acted as a barrier to testing. Yet, as The Times points out, the most notable aspect of the state's rejuvenated approach to combating HIV isn't Truvada, but the combined economics of the strategies involved. None of these methods should lead to increased spending because they don't include new medical breakthroughs. In fact, the state will probably end up saving money if everything goes as planned, because every prevented HIV case saves about $400,000 in medical costs.",0.6583492584467724,0.3416507415532276,0.6437716700840229,719,5.0152990264255912,385,6.0935064935064931,0,0,"Science, US & World",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(A separate pick up section will be established for mobile orders, speeding up the process even further.)

""To put these protections in place, I'm asking the FCC to reclassifying internet service under Title II of a law known as the Telecommunications Act,"" Obama says in a statement this morning. ""In plain English, I'm asking [the FCC] to recognize that for most Americans, the internet has become an essential part of everyday communication and everyday life.""  The decision is still up to the FCC There's been a growing battle around protecting net neutrality — the principle that all internet traffic, no matter what it is or where it comes from, should be treated equally — ever since the FCC's original protections were struck down in court earlier this year. Those protections were able to be struck down because the commission didn't make the rules in a way that it actually had authority over, so it's been trying to create new rules that it will definitely be able to enforce. It hasn't chosen to use Title II so far, but net neutrality advocates, now including President Obama, have been pushing for its use. Regulating internet service under Title II would mean reclassifying it as a utility, like water. This means that internet providers would just be pumping internet back and forth through pipes and not actually making any decisions about where the internet goes. For the most part, that's a controversial idea in the eyes of service providers alone. It means that they're losing some control over what they sell, and that they can't favor certain services to benefit their own business. Instead, providers would be stuck allowing consumers to use the internet as they want to, using whatever services they like without any penalty. If that sounds pretty great, it's because that's basically how the internet has worked up until now. Obama's support of Title II reclassification comes at a critical time for net neutrality. While the FCC is in the process of making new rules to protect net neutrality, those rules would actually allow internet providers to offer so-called ""fast lanes,"" effectively defeating the purpose of net neutrality in the first place. During a public comment period over the summer, Americans spoke out loudly against the proposal, but it's not yet clear what the commission plans to do in response. FCC chair Tom Wheeler has said that he isn't entirely opposed to Title II, but that's appeared to be only if other methods won't work first. Netflix might get what it wants under Obama's plan In a statement outlining what he'd like internet service to look like, Obama highlights four major points: internet providers wouldn't be allowed to block websites offering legal content, they wouldn't be allowed to intentionally slow down or speed up certain websites or services based on their own preferences, and they wouldn't be able to offer paid fast lanes. Obama also asks that the FCC investigate and potentially apply net neutrality rules to the interconnect points that sit between service providers, like Comcast and Verizon, and content providers, like Netflix. That's potentially huge news for Netflix, which has been arguing that this area of the internet should be covered by net neutrality all year. Obama also asks that the commission apply these rules to mobile internet service. That would be a significant change as well, as mobile service hasn't previously been subject to the same net neutrality rules that wired connections have been. That said, Obama does leave a significant amount of room for exceptions in the wireless space, potentially allowing some amount of throttling so that providers can manage their networks when under heavy use. Notably, his proposal also asks the FCC not to enforce rate regulations on internet service. There's still the big question of whether the FCC will listen to Obama's recommendation and whether Congress will actually allow it. Obama's support of Title II reclassification may provide the political support that the commission needs to justify such a rule change, but with Republicans wary of regulation taking over the Senate, it's an increasingly risky proposition. The FCC may set the rules, but there's plenty that Congress can do to sway its decisions. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) has already tweeted out, ""'Net Neutrality' is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government."" ""We will incorporate the President’s submission into the record."" Following Obama's announcement, the FCC responded with a statement that doesn't really move the needle — and, in fact, basically says that it'll lump Obama's opinion in with everyone else's. ""As an independent regulatory agency we will incorporate the President’s submission into the record of the Open Internet proceeding,"" chairman Wheeler says. ""We welcome comment on it and how it proposes to use Title II of the Communications Act."" Obama is well aware that he doesn't set the policy here, but his statement points out to the commission that this policy change is well supported by the public. ""The FCC is an independent agency, and ultimately the decision is their's alone,"" Obama says. ""But the public has already commented nearly 4 million times asking that consumers — not the cable company — gets to decide which sites they use."" The Hill reports that Republicans are already moving toward an overhaul of the Communications Act after last week's election, potentially streamlining the rules used to regulate different types of services, like phone, TV, and internet. Exactly what those changes will mean are unclear, but net neutrality advocates are reportedly concerned that it could move toward a deregulation of the communications industry. In its statement, the FCC also confirms reports that it's been examining taking a ""hybrid"" approach to net neutrality. It's believed that the commission's hybrid plan would place heavy regulations on interconnect points — making content providers like Netflix happy — while still allowing some degree of fast lanes for consumers. Ultimately, the FCC just says that it needs more time. While it had hoped to have net neutrality rules in place by the end of the year, it's clearly found that its current plans aren't what people want. It now says that it needs time to determine what legal obstacles would come up should it use a hybrid approach or full Title II reclassification. ""The more deeply we examined the issues around the various legal options,"" Wheeler writes, ""the more it has become plain that there is more work to do."" I'm urging the @FCC to keep the internet open and free. Here's my plan to protect #NetNeutrality for everyone: http://t.co/3y3YLQD6MB –bo  You can read Obama's full statement below: An open Internet is essential to the American economy, and increasingly to our very way of life. By lowering the cost of launching a new idea, igniting new political movements, and bringing communities closer together, it has been one of the most significant democratizing influences the world has ever known.   ""Net neutrality"" has been built into the fabric of the Internet since its creation — but it is also a principle that we cannot take for granted. We cannot allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas. That is why today, I am asking the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to answer the call of almost 4 million public comments, and implement the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality.   When I was a candidate for this office, I made clear my commitment to a free and open Internet, and my commitment remains as strong as ever. Four years ago, the FCC tried to implement rules that would protect net neutrality with little to no impact on the telecommunications companies that make important investments in our economy. After the rules were challenged, the court reviewing the rules agreed with the FCC that net neutrality was essential for preserving an environment that encourages new investment in the network, new online services and content, and everything else that makes up the Internet as we now know it. Unfortunately, the court ultimately struck down the rules — not because it disagreed with the need to protect net neutrality, but because it believed the FCC had taken the wrong legal approach.   The FCC is an independent agency, and ultimately this decision is theirs alone. I believe the FCC should create a new set of rules protecting net neutrality and ensuring that neither the cable company nor the phone company will be able to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online. The rules I am asking for are simple, common-sense steps that reflect the Internet you and I use every day, and that some ISPs already observe. These bright-line rules include:                 If carefully designed, these rules should not create any undue burden for ISPs, and can have clear, monitored exceptions for reasonable network management and for specialized services such as dedicated, mission-critical networks serving a hospital. But combined, these rules mean everything for preserving the Internet’s openness.   The rules also have to reflect the way people use the Internet today, which increasingly means on a mobile device. I believe the FCC should make these rules fully applicable to mobile broadband as well, while recognizing the special challenges that come with managing wireless networks.   To be current, these rules must also build on the lessons of the past. For almost a century, our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of your home or business. That is why a phone call from a customer of one phone company can reliably reach a customer of a different one, and why you will not be penalized solely for calling someone who is using another provider. It is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information — whether a phone call, or a packet of data.   So the time has come for the FCC to recognize that broadband service is of the same importance and must carry the same obligations as so many of the other vital services do. To do that, I believe the FCC should reclassify consumer broadband service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act — while at the same time forbearing from rate regulation and other provisions less relevant to broadband services. This is a basic acknowledgment of the services ISPs provide to American homes and businesses, and the straightforward obligations necessary to ensure the network works for everyone — not just one or two companies.   Investment in wired and wireless networks has supported jobs and made America the center of a vibrant ecosystem of digital devices, apps, and platforms that fuel growth and expand opportunity. Importantly, network investment remained strong under the previous net neutrality regime, before it was struck down by the court; in fact, the court agreed that protecting net neutrality helps foster more investment and innovation. If the FCC appropriately forbears from the Title II regulations that are not needed to implement the principles above — principles that most ISPs have followed for years — it will help ensure new rules are consistent with incentives for further investment in the infrastructure of the Internet.   The Internet has been one of the greatest gifts our economy — and our society — has ever known. The FCC was chartered to promote competition, innovation, and investment in our networks. In service of that mission, there is no higher calling than protecting an open, accessible, and free Internet. I thank the Commissioners for having served this cause with distinction and integrity, and I respectfully ask them to adopt the policies I have outlined here, to preserve this technology’s promise for today, and future generations to come.

Irish advertising agency EightyTwenty just launched a controversial new campaign on Tinder that uses several fake profiles of actresses portraying women supposedly forced into sex work in the country. The first few photos on these profiles are nothing out of the ordinary, but interested parties who swipe right to see more photos soon come across images of the women showing startlingly realistic simulated injuries and other signs of abuse. The final two images on each fake profile include a message decrying sex trafficking and a link to another organization, Turn Off The Red Light, which seeks a full ban on all forms of sex work throughout all of Ireland. Up until recently, sex work was technically legal under Irish law, although public solicitation was not. Yet politicians in Northern Ireland recently passed a bill that makes any exchange of money for sexual services illegal, even when the exchange is consensual.  There are several big issues with this campaign: the first and most obvious being that creating fake profiles would seem to go against Tinder's own user guidelines. It's also an odd tactic to take to rally support for any cause: tricking people into believing what they're seeing are actual potential dating matches, only to find out they've been duped by a political campaign. But most problematic is the conflation of human trafficking with consensual sex work. The group linked to in each of these fake Tinder profiles, Turn Off The Red Light, claims that ""very few women choose to willingly engage in prostitution. Most who are involved have had very few real choices."" Sex trafficking is a very real and pervasive problem, but it is not the same as consensual sex work, as the Human Trafficking Center notes. And the fact is that the overwhelming majority of sex workers in Ireland are opposed to the ban on their services, and say that criminalizing their business — driving it out of the public regulatory framework — will only make it more unsafe.

The mysterious barges appeared around the country in the latter half of 2013, with one in San Francisco, and one in Portland, Maine. After much speculation about their purpose, a Google spokesperson confirmed in November last year that it was exploring using the barges as ""an interactive space where people can learn about new technology,"" such as its augmented reality Glass wearable. But at that point, The Wall Street Journal reports, the project had already been on hold for two months after the US Coast Guard repeatedly raised fire-safety concerns that Google was unable to satisfactorily answer. ""Over 5,000 gallons of fuel on the main deck."" The documents obtained show that the Coast Guard had significant questions about Google's plan at every stage of its development. In an email sent in March 2013, Robert Gauvin, the Coast Guard's acting chief of commercial vessel compliance, warned that the barges would have ""over 5,000 gallons of fuel on the main deck"" alongside a ""substantial amount of combustible material."" In August, the Coast Guard wrote that the boat's designs didn't incorporate ""certain fire safety features typically required,"" and said that it could not ascertain whether Google's contractor had made provisions for the evacuation of disabled people. In September, a Coast Guard inspector reiterated that more safety measures were needed. Google said it expected 1,200 people would visit the San Francisco showroom every day, but Foss Maritime, the contractor building the barges, said no more than 150 would be on board at the same time. Gauvin questioned this number in a March email, in which he said he was ""unaware of any measures you plan to use to actually limit the number of passengers,"" and expressed his concern that ""significant work has already been performed without full consent of the Coast Guard."" Some Coast Guar dofficials signed non-disclosure agreements with Google The Wall Street Journal reports that some Coast Guard officials signed non-disclosure agreements with Google to keep the barge's purpose secret, a decision the government body later lamented. ""In hindsight we should have sought legal review earlier,"" said one captain in an internal mail to a group of officers. The tech giant also tried to get government officials on side, offering National Park Service managers a tour of the showroom that began with a journey in ""a special Google speed boat."" Despite Google's best efforts to convince the relevant officials, the fire risk was apparently too high for the project to continue. Google was ordered to move its San Francisco barge in February this year, and dismantled and sold the Portland barge for scrap in August.",0.5180805894759828,0.4819194105240172,0.8619264947594405,478,5.2364016736401675,283,6.1908127208480561,0,0,"Google, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The attackers often knew a target's room number and full name The attackers start by gaining control over the hotel's in-house Wi-Fi network, giving them the tools for a classic man-in-the-middle attack. From there, they would offer the target a fake update — usually made up to look like an Adobe, Windows or Google update — which would download password-harvesting software as well as a key logger to track the suspect's movements. Once the attackers had gained access to the target's accounts, the tools were deleted so as to leave no trace of the attack. Little is known about the attackers themselves, but they are still at large and appear to be well-funded and well-organized.

This morning, Europol revealed the extent of Operation Onymous, a mission carried out with the help of Eurojust, the FBI, the US Department of Homeland Security, and other agencies. According to a statement, 17 sellers and site admins were arrested, and around 410 hidden services (""darknet"" servers that are accessible only through a browser using privacy software Tor) were shut down. The operation seized $1 million in bitcoins, the preferred currency of darknet markets, along with around $225,000 (€180,000) in ""cash, drugs, gold, and silver."" Some major markets are still online so far It's not clear exactly what was shut down, but a thread on Reddit's darknet markets forum has kept a running tally of potential victims. So far, that includes Hydra, Cloud Nine, BlueSky, Pandora, Alpaca, and other sites that sprung up as law enforcement took down the original Silk Road bazaar in 2013. Some major markets appear to have escaped the shutdown, including Evolution and Agora, an invitation-only site that reportedly had more listings than Silk Road 2 as of September. But there's understandable suspicion that the operation isn't completely over, whether that means more markets will be going down or they've simply been infiltrated by law enforcement, as Silk Road 2 was. In addition to Benthall, Irish law enforcement announced yesterday that they had arrested two men in a darknet drug bust, seizing around $2 million in bitcoins. Benthall himself was arrested due to what seem in hindsight like a series of obvious mistakes, including using an email address that included his name to register the Silk Road 2 servers and failing to mask his IP address when contacting the service providers. He also tweeted references to the Silk Road and to making bitcoin payments. He was charged in court yesterday, and if convicted, he faces life in prison on money laundering, narcotics trafficking, and other charges. In his brief hearing, a prosecutor said he ""did admit to everything,"" although he has not made a formal plea. This is the second major operation against darknet markets. The first Silk Road, which launched in 2011, was shut down in October of 2013, and its alleged operator Ross Ulbricht was arrested; his trial is currently set for early next year. Silk Road 2 was launched a month later, and Benthall is supposed to have taken over in December, after which he ran it continuously. It's not clear whether operators of the other sites shut down in the raid have been arrested, and if so, where they were located, but law enforcement is calling its action a clear victory.

The program — which was kept secret from professors and students alike — was revealed this week at a faculty meeting, reports The Boston Globe. The research project, which was carried out this past spring, used cameras placed in lecture halls to take a photo every minute. According to remarks from university vice provost Peter Bol, computer software then analyzed the pictures to see how many students attended lectures. The photographs were then destroyed. But university officials didn't inform professors or their students that they were being monitored. Bol says that was to make sure that the data gathered was accurate, and he added that the research wasn't designed to track particular students or analyze professors. Instead, professors were provided the data after the research was completed. The incident raises concerns over how and when a community can be studied for research without their knowledge.

According to Variety, the app will soon be available on the iPhone as well. As Variety details, Help was shot with a custom camera rig made up of four RED cameras, each shooting in 6K resolution. The resulting footage was then stitched together to create the film, in which audiences can look around in a 360-degree field of view as an alien attack descends upon Los Angeles. According to the report, versions of the Spotlight Stories are going to be released on Google's mobile YouTube apps as well, giving as many people as possible the opportunity to check out the different projects.

The filmmaking team behind movies like Cloud Atlas and the Matrix trilogy have built a career on creating worlds you’ve never seen and spelunking deep into the depths of a million navel-gazing questions about the nature of existence and our place in the universe. What they’ve struggled with — particularly over the past 10 years — have been characters worth caring about.  After Bound (a criminally underrated bit of character-heavy noir) and the original The Matrix (which owed its success to bringing laser-sharp archetypes to life as much it did to stunning visual effects), Andy and Lana Wachowski have largely been out in the wilderness, making movies about stylistic conceits and abstract intellectual reaches without ever attaining that same level of cultural relevancy they did so many years ago. In my review earlier this year of Jupiter Ascending, I wondered if the medium was the problem; if they were simply trying to cram too much into the constraints of your average movie, and if switching to a longer, serialized form of storytelling could be the answer.  Now that Netflix is getting ready to release Sense8, the 12-episode TV series the Wachowskis created with writer J. Michael Straczynski (Babylon 5), it’s time to answer that question. Sense8 revolves around a group of eight individuals across the world — or ""sensates"" — all of whom find themselves able to tap into and experience the senses of each other.  A Chicago cop (Brian J. Smith) is disturbed by dance music next door, when in reality it’s the set that a London DJ named Riley (Tuppence Middleton) is spinning. A woman in Mumbai (Tina Desai) grabs an umbrella on a sunny day, while in Berlin a young criminal (Max Riemelt) attends a rain-soaked funeral. It provides for some fun connective tissue as the first episode unfolds, holding together a rather disparate set of stories — and of course it wouldn’t be a television show about people with mysterious powers if there wasn’t some sort of shadowy conspiracy in play. In this case it’s Lost’s Naveen Andrews, playing a enigmatic figure trying to bring the group of eight together for reasons unknown (or at least, reasons that remained unknown during the first three episodes that Netflix previewed). The set-up sounds like Heroes or any other number of shows from the 2000s, but the Wachowskis — who direct the entire season — differentiate their show by taking different genre approaches with each character’s story. Wolfgang’s tale takes on the vibe of a gritty crime thriller, while the story of a closeted Mexican movie star and the actress who’s obsessed with him plays like a tongue-in-cheek comedy of errors. The show shot in eight different countries, and the Wachowskis are stretching their legs here, clearly having fun with the expanded canvas they’re able to work with, while never sacrificing their signature attention to detail or style. Whether it’s ponderous slow-motion or a dancehall rave, there’s no question: they’re going Full Wachowski.   At times, that visual styling does cause Sense8 to feel a bit like a throwback. Everything from the concept to the show’s opening credits font and music cue — a thinly veiled riff on Radiohead’s ""Pyramid Song"" — feels planted firmly in the early aughts. It’s distracting at first, especially coming from filmmakers that have been bent on pushing things forward at all costs, and it doesn’t help that Sense8 takes its time in distinguishing itself from existing shows. But as it picks up steam and begins delving into the familiar Wachowski themes — that we are all interconnected, across lines of race, sexuality, gender, and class — it begins to establish its own sense of identity. By the end of the third episode, when the show finally gets the chance to add the Wachowski’s penchant for action choreography to the mix, the combination had me fully on board. But all of those flourishes and concepts pale in comparison to the patient stories Sense8 wants to tell. While there are crimes, unjust incarcerations, and chases, over the first three episodes, the bombastic plot twists are relatively rare and there’s no fantastic sci-fi to be seen. Instead, the show takes its time, building its world moment by methodical moment. It’s not as heavy on plot as many binge-hungry viewers are going to want, but the approach lends a sense of intimacy to the show that I've never seen the Wachowskis pull off before. Nowhere is it more apparent than in the story of Nomi (Jamie Clayton), a transgender writer living in San Francisco. Sense8 is one of the most diverse shows in recent memory, and while that deserves praise in and of itself, it also feels like the show would argue that’s not the point. Nomi is simply an incredibly relatable character brought to life by Clayton’s vulnerable, standout performance. She is the beating heart of Sense8, and Clayton allows the Wachowskis to move beyond intellectual discussion, and imbue the show’s ideas with an actual soul. From the globe-spanning production to the bold choices in characters, Sense8 feels like the exact kind of show Netflix needs to make to stay vital — one that could be matched only by the likes of HBO. And for the Wachowskis themselves, it’s a new beginning: a chance to adapt to a new medium and start a fresh chapter in their careers when the odds are they may never again get the free rein in big-budget filmmaking they once enjoyed. Of course, plenty of shows have had promising starts only to collapse as they stretch on; hell, the Wachowskis have already done it once themselves with the Matrix trilogy. But consider this: the last time I saw a Wachowski project, I spent two hours inside a theater and wished I’d never met speed-skating Channing Tatum. Right now I’m nearly three hours into Sense8 — and I’m looking forward to hanging out with these characters for the next nine. Sense8 debuts on Netflix on June 5th.",0.6389396694122136,0.3610603305877864,0.18178858721219274,1011,4.9703264094955486,573,6.1867364746945901,0,8,"Culture, Entertainment, TV Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

My hope for AMC’s Halt and Catch Fire — the ‘80s period drama that begins its second season this Sunday — is that it will live long enough to work its way through one of the most pivotal periods in modern computing, from the rise of the PC to the explosion of the internet. The show won me over by lovingly exploring the world of IBM clones, and if the first four episodes of season two are any indication, its characters are doing their best to catch the technological zeitgeist again. But as they do, the series risks losing the focus that’s made it great so far. The first season of Halt and Catch Fire was built around the Cardiff Giant, a potentially revolutionary laptop designed in the shadow of IBM. Its world wasn’t much larger than the confines of fictional mainframe company Cardiff Electric and the prickly relationship between its four main characters: embittered engineer Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy), his wife and former business partner Donna (Kerry Bishé), punk wunderkind Cameron Howe (Mackenzie Davis), and manipulative visionary Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace). By the end of the arc, they had both beat the odds and failed miserably, releasing a decent machine but losing sight of the dream behind it. Then Joe lit their first shipment on fire and disappeared on a stargazing quest. It is not a particularly subtle show. The latest season takes place a year later in 1985, at Cameron and Donna’s fledgling online games company Mutiny. Where Cardiff Electric was a staid beast that ended up being acquired and all but dissolved, Mutiny is an anarchic startup that literally can’t keep the lights on, and a great vehicle for the show’s two female leads. At Cardiff, Joe and Gordon drew easy comparisons to Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. (They’re now, respectively, starting a fly-by-night time-sharing service and recovering from months of cocaine-fueled crunch time.) No matter how important female programmers and designers have been in the real world, a two-woman partnership just isn’t part of our technological folklore, and Halt and Catch Fire is all the more interesting for exploring it.   In the first season, Donna was a deft subversion of the ""killjoy wife"" stereotype, and here, she’s resisting being typecast as the sensible office mom. Cameron increasingly comes off as the conservative one — a woman once seen scamming arcade machines with a string and quarter is now furious when freeloaders sneak onto her network. One of Halt and Catch Fire’s greatest strengths is that it avoids pigeonholing its characters into nerds or smooth operators, pragmatists or dreamers. They’re defined by their intense dedication to building something great, whatever that might be, and they’ll work around each other to achieve it. Here, the showrunners are trying to move that intensity from computers to video games. In some ways, they’ve beaten the BBC’s upcoming Grand Theft Auto drama to the punch. Instead of breakthroughs in LCD screens, characters are figuring out chat rooms and networked first-person shooters. It’s much more immediately relatable — even if nobody is still using ‘80s PCs, you could boot up Zork right now. The overall melodrama has been toned down, but the bombastic moments that remain (including Donna and Cameron stealing servers for Mutiny off the back of a van) are still pretty good. Ironically, though, the show itself feels less comfortable in its new territory. Compared to the incredible detail around Cardiff, characters are strangely disconnected from the rest of gaming and web history, especially considering how much was going on at the time. Atari and the home console market had just collapsed, companies like Sierra Online were shipping groundbreaking computer games across the country in plastic bags, and online bulletin board systems were already proving that people would pay to hang out with friends. Mutiny’s flagship title, a fantasy adventure called Parallax, would have been hard-pressed to stand against Infocom’s increasingly sophisticated work. When Cameron envisions a ""totally immersive"" shooter that lets you fight your friends, she’s imagining a genre that would blow up a decade later… but she’s also just described the ‘70s ARPANET game Maze War. Exact historical accuracy is a bad goal for fiction, and it’s better to give too little detail than turn the story into a series of pop culture references. But whether or not Cardiff Electric was really inventing the future, Halt and Catch Fire’s passion for the world of Silicon Prairie always made us feel like it might be. Now, we just aren’t getting enough fictional background to understand why Mutiny is prescient. The first season partly got away with bending history because its characters had shut out the rest of the world. PCs were developed under tight secrecy, and while the threat of competition was always there, Cardiff itself was self-contained. Here, though, it’s opening up in more ways than one. Joe and Gordon are trying to adjust to life outside the walls of corporate computing — Joe, particularly, is trying to build real relationships after years of ruthless, rootless careerism. Mutiny’s gaming network and Joe’s time-shared mainframes democratize things that were once reserved for big businesses and university campuses, making them vulnerable in the process. It’s a smart metaphor for the entire world of tech, just one that characters could engage with more. The foundation of Halt and Catch Fire, like its fellow AMC dramas Breaking Bad and Mad Men, is craft. The human drama grows out of watching characters excel at something that most people will never try. Even if their explanations are basically gibberish, it feels like being inducted into the secret club of meth cooking or cigarette advertising or making double-sided motherboards. If there’s a single problem with the latest season so far, it’s that it spends a little too much time on concepts and not enough on how brilliant, complicated people make them happen. If there’s a salvation, it’s that Halt and Catch Fire is also about the fact that being brilliant isn’t enough. Unique ideas turn out to be common, or they’re shamelessly ripped off, or they just get derailed by bad luck. Unless it evolves into outright alternate history, the ex-Cardiff team can never displace Steve Jobs or Lord British. They’ll make their small dent in the world, watch someone else make a bigger one, and move on. And right now, I can only hope everything comes together before history blindsides them one more time.",0.5155201813964876,0.4844798186035124,0.1615436046340425,1104,5.1422101449275361,630,6.2634920634920634,0,4,"Culture, Entertainment, TV Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

And while the company says Logi ""goes well beyond tech,"" this first try sticks to something Logitech is very familiar with: iPad accessories. Specifically, today marks the introduction of the Logi Blok family of cases for iPad Air and iPad mini — with durable, rugged designs that are meant to be dropped and withstand impacts from a maximum height of six feet.   ""Our designers worked with material experts to protect the most sensitive parts of the iPad without adding the bulk you associate with ultra-protective cases,"" Logitech said in a press release. And that's basically true; the Logi Blok cases can take some serious bumps without adding the heft that we've seen from companies like Otterbox. Each corner of the case(s) — they all feature a rectangular design with sharp corners — contains an absorbent polymer that flexes whenever your Apple tablet takes a substantial drop. Logitech has tried to reinforce the corners since damaging them is often a quick route to catastrophic damage and screen destruction.   The colorful designs hold true to the new ethos that Logitech is pushing with Logi, and the simplest of the Blok cases comes in at $39.99. This includes a free screen protector, though the step-up Blok Protective Case ($69.99) has a proper flap that covers the screen and an ""any-angle"" stand that lets you position the iPad in various positions when sitting. This case is available only for iPad Air 2, which is also true of the ""flagship"" Logi Blok Protective Keyboard Case. For $129.99, you're getting a version of the Protective Case that includes a detachable keyboard (with dedicated iOS shortcut buttons). The keyboard snaps onto the case with a firm magnetic connection that auto aligns whenever you hold the two in close proximity. Logitech has always produced some of the better iPad keyboards out there, and this also seemed perfectly usable in my brief hands-on time. All three cases will be available starting in August, and Logitech says this is just the beginning of a big future for the Logi brand.

Samsung is introducing the stylish Galaxy A8 in China today, which Engadget points out is its slimmest phone yet, measuring only 5.9mm thick. It's a continuation of what Samsung has been doing with its Galaxy A line, which has been putting out slim, all-metal phones (the last phone in the line, the Galaxy A7, came in it at 6.3mm thick). The A8 is by no means the slimmest smartphone around, but it stands out in comparison to today's flagships: the iPhone 6 is 6.9mm thick, and the Galaxy S6 is 7.1mm thick. Style really does take precedence over everything else here. While the Galaxy A8 is a good looking phone, it's distinctly mid-range on the inside. The phone has a 5.7-inch, 1080p display, 2GB of RAM, and a 16-megapixel rear camera. It's supposedly using a Snapdragon 615, which we first saw in some of last year's mid-range devices. It's selling for ¥3,199.00 (around $515 USD), which is a bit on the pricier side given some of its specs. The good news is that Samsung's lesser-known lines are no longer the only way to get a Galaxy phone that looks and feels good. The Galaxy S6 is one of its best devices yet on both style and substance, and — given the A8's size — it's possible that we'll see the Note line take a similar cue and start slimming down.

And according to LiveScience, that discovery — published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters — may be the missing link in the asteroid crash that sparked the diversification of life on Earth nearly 500 million years ago. destruction and species diversification The meteorite in question was found in a quarry located just west of Stockholm. Finding meteorites there isn’t all that surprising, given that more than 100 have been dug up in the past 20 years. But previous finds were all of the common L-chondrite variety, a class of meteorite that started raining down on Earth 470 million years ago when a small asteroid crashed into a much larger one made up of these L-chondrites. That crash, scientists say, caused a meteor shower that resulted in just the right amount of destruction to drive animals and plants to diversify and form new species. But the specifics of that crash have always been shrouded in mystery, because the composition of the first, smaller asteroid is unknown. That’s why the new meteorite discovery is so important: scientists think it’s a fragment of the ""asteroid destroyer"" that triggered an explosion of species diversification on Earth. David Harper, a geologist at Durham University who did not participate in the study, told New Scientist that ""the team may at last have identified the impactor responsible for the break-up of the parent body of the L-chondrite meteorites."" But that finding will need to be validated, because some scientists aren’t even sure it belongs to a new class of meteorite yet. Timothy Swindle, a meteorite expert at the University of Arizona, told LiveScience that he thinks scientists might still be able to link it to known classes of meteorite — despite the compositional differences that set it apart from previous finds. ""I think it's entirely plausible [that it's a new kind of meteorite], and it's a great study, but that's not a guarantee they've got it right,"" Swindle said. ""But if they didn't, it's because of new things we'll find out in future work, not because of their analysis."" scientists are calling it the ""mysterious object"" The new meteorite hasn’t been named yet, but it might end up being called ""Österplana,"" after a nearby church. In the meantime, however, researchers are choosing to call it the ""mysterious object"" — and given the questions that continue to surround it, that interim name seems appropriate. ""One thing our study shows is that we maybe don't know as much as we think we know about the solar system,"" Birger Schmitz, lead author of the study, told LiveScience. ""I think our new finding adds to the understanding that the meteorites that come down on Earth today may not be entirely representative of what is out there.""",0.49314510161851177,0.5068548983814882,0.844660568653671,485,5.0432989690721648,266,6.0263157894736841,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks to this work, we know about the various molecules, behaviors, and neurons involved in the male’s pursuit of the female fly. But when it comes to the neurobiology of female sexual behavior, the opposite is true: few studies have looked into the mechanisms that allow females to choose a mate. This, some researchers say, has to do with how obvious the males' behaviors are — they're easier to study and are more eye-catching — but others suggest it has more to do with the lens through which scientists look at male and female behaviors. Fortunately, three studies published today in Neuron and Current Biology are challenging the male bias that has marked fruit fly sex research by describing, in detail, the neurobiology of female sexual receptivity. And, unsurprisingly, their findings reveal that it’s more complicated than some scientists previously assumed. ""the female must be doing a lot, but we just couldn’t see it."" ""When you read accounts of fly courtship, it’s all male-centric; it’s all based on what you can observe about the male,"" says Joel Levine, a biologist and fruit fly expert at the University of Toronto at Mississauga. ""But a lot of us have felt all along the way that the problem has been our own; that the female must be doing a lot, but we just couldn’t see it."" In the first study, published today in Current Biology, scientists describe a novel female sexual receptivity behavior called ""pausing."" This behavior’s name is pretty spot on: when the female decides to interact with a courting male, she stops her movements. Researchers also linked the pausing behavior to a gene called Abdominal-B, which is well-known as a gene involved in fly development. When the researchers silenced the gene during development, or when they artificially inactivated neurons that are linked to the gene, female flies were unable to pause to interact with males.""The gene needs to function normally during the development of the nervous system to create the high probability of female mating,"" says Jennifer Bussell, a molecular biologist at The Rockefeller University in New York City and lead author of the study. ""So we think these neurons are part of the real meat of female sexual receptivity."" Levine, who did not participate in any of the three studies, describes Bussell’s results as ""cool"" because ""they introduced something new, and then defined it."" ""these neurons are part of the real meat of female sexual receptivity."" In another study, published in Neuron, researchers traced how the ""sex peptide"" — a small protein in the male’s ejaculate — acts on the female’s brain to prevent her from mating for about 10 days after her initial copulation. ""We identified cells in the central nervous system that communicate with the sex peptide receptors located on the uterus,"" says Mark Palfreyman, a molecular biologist at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology in Austria and co-first author of the study. When these neurons were inactivated, the female flies disregarded the signals from the sex peptides and mated with other males much sooner than expected. In a third study, also published in Neuron, researchers identified two small groups of brain cells involved in organizing female behavior and integrating the different sensory cues from the male — his pheromones and his courtship song — in the female brain. Researchers were able to demonstrate the role these neurons play by artificially inactivating them, which caused females to delay mating, as well as by activating them, which spurred the females to mate more readily with courting males. ""The basis for how the female connects song quality to a decision to mate or not mate has been a mystery,"" says Bruce Baker, a neuroscientist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and a co-author of the study. But ""our work suggests that the neurons we identified likely contribute to the female's judgment of whether a courting male is an attractive suitor that she should mate with."" ""in the animal world, females have been seen as passive."" ""Since the early 1900s, just watching the flies’ behavior, it was easy to see that the male chases the female around, extends a wing, and sings,"" Bussell says. But the female has always been seen as having a ""sort of passive acceptance response,"" she says — ""and I do think that, in general, in the animal world, females have been seen as passive."" That’s why Bussell thinks scientists need to take a closer look at the female fly’s behavior to understand and identify the neurons that control the steps leading to copulation. Combined, the studies help demonstrate that scientists who believed there was more to female receptivity in fruit flies were correct, Levine says — a feeling echoed by Palfreyman, who explained that ""it took a lot of time really, and a lot of people staring at flies, for researchers to start saying ‘hey the female is doing something quite interesting and we should look at this.’"" scientists prefer studying male genitalia This isn’t the first time researchers have spoken out about science’s tendency to prioritize male sexuality, and males in general. In May, for instance, researchers published a study demonstrating that scientists display a marked preference toward studying male genitalia, as opposed to female genitalia, and that this tendency has actually worsened since 2000. This bias, the researchers wrote, ""reflects enduring assumptions about the dominant role of males in sex, and invariant female genitalia,"" despite mounting evidence of ""how rapidly female genital traits can evolve."" ""There’s this cliche that if men menstruated, we would probably have a different approach to the science of PMS and, you know, that’s probably true,"" Levine says. But it’s also possible to look at the publication of these three studies positively, he says. ""It’s a metaphor for what’s happening in human society as well."" More labs have started to look at female reproduction and sexual behavior, and they’re doing so ""in a big way."" This is an important development, he says, because if we want to get a handle on the ""broader biological issues, like how species evolved and what makes for healthy offspring, we need to have a more balanced perspective.""",0.7635705588104855,0.23642944118951448,0.21229583668969235,1053,5.1642924976258309,494,6.4392712550607287,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In a separate statement provided to The Guardian, Facebook said the research was designed to ""improve our services and to make the content people see on Facebook as relevant and engaging as possible."" ""Having written and designed this experiment myself, I can tell you that our goal was never to upset anyone,"" says Kramer.

But according to a new study, something more worrying is happening to 99 percent of the ocean's plastic: it's disappearing. The study outlines the findings of scientists who trawled the waters around five large ocean gyres in 2010 and 2011. The data they obtained put them far short of the expected amount of plastic in the ocean — rather than millions of tons, the global load of ocean plastic was calculated at 40,000 tons at most. Carlos Duarte, an oceanographer at the University of Western Australia and co-author of the study, said that the findings mean we ""can't account for 99 percent of the plastic that we have in the ocean."" The missing plastic could have been eaten by ocean animals Most of the ocean's plastic is expected to be microscopic in size, after having been broken down by the action of waves and radiation from the sun, but the scientists behind the study used very fine mesh nets that should have been able to pick up even these minuscule fragments. Instead, scientists have to consider other destinations for our garbage. Duarte thinks the missing millions of tons could be entering the stomachs of marine animals. We don't know the consequences of animals eating ocean plastic ""There is potential,"" Duarte says, ""for this plastic to enter the global ocean food web."" Duarte notes that we are part of the same food web as the plastic-gobbling fish, but we don't know how damaging this could be for our ecosystem. Speaking to Science, Peter Davison, oceanographer at California's Farallon Institute for Advanced Ecosystem Research, said plastics could ""suck up all the pollutants in the water and concentrate them"" in the food chain, or fish could be ""puking or pooping"" the plastic out, leading to no long-term damage. Davison notes the missing plastic could also be dragged down by the weight of animal feces clinging to it or organisms growing on it, washing ashore, or breaking down even further so as to be undetectable, but he says the fact that fish and other marine creatures are eating our plastic waste is ""indisputable."" With millions of tons of plastic going unaccounted for in our oceans, and the uncertain consequences of animals ingesting such material, the scientists agree more research is needed.",0.13458643755118516,0.8654135624488148,0.86645895226795,426,4.938967136150235,234,5.8803418803418808,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sci News is reporting that astronomers at the University of New South Wales have discovered an Earthlike planet just 16 light-years away. The planet, dubbed Gliese 832c, is orbiting a red dwarf star half the mass and radius of our own sun. Gliese 832c has an orbital period of about 35 days, and a mass more than five times that of Earth's. More importantly, however, Gliese 832c is orbiting within the habitable zone of the red dwarf, and receives the same average stellar energy as Earth does from the sun, Sci News reports.    Gliese 832c's mass means it likely has a far denser atmosphere than Earth does, which could make the planet's weather hot and volatile. If this is the case, the planet might be more like a super-Venus than a super-Earth.

What about when you want to carry people to Mars? To test landing a larger payload on the red planet, NASA yesterday sent a flying saucer-like craft called the Low Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) 180,000 feet into the Earth's atmosphere over Hawaii — and then dropped it. The craft, dubbed Keiki o ka honua, or ""child from earth"" in Hawaiian, was equipped with a donut-shaped ""Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator,"" which deployed first to create drag, slowing down the craft to just 2.5 times the speed of sound. Then, the LDSD deployed NASA's largest supersonic parachute yet.   The parachute, which measures a giant 36 meters (118 feet) in diameter, was designed to slow down the LDSD enough to make a soft splash landing in the Pacific. But the test wasn't entirely successful, and the LDSD made a rather harsh water landing after the parachute failed to fully inflate. According to Yahoo News, NASA said that the $150-million test also wasn't a failure. ""What we saw is a very good test,"" said NASA mission specialist Dan Coatta. ""This is an opportunity to look at the data and learn what happened and apply that for the next test,"" he said. NASA's new parachute is bigger than any others it's tried before, but isn't otherwise a new idea. NASA tested and used giant parachutes as early as the 1970s with its Viking landers. NASA landed Curiosity, on the other hand, with the help of a rocket-powered ""Sky Crane,"" which hovered over the red planet and slowly lowered Curiosity to its surface.

Unfortunately, the story has turned out to be significantly more complicated. While there is a major security upgrade happening to the payments system in the US, the majority of cards being issued in the US still require only a signature to complete a purchase. A PIN is obviously stronger protection against fraud than a signature, which can be easily forged and is ignored by most cashiers anyway. So why is the US moving to the less secure version of a more secure system, and why did the media get it wrong? This debate started with a global standard developed in 1994 by Europay, MasterCard, and Visa known as EMV. The standard ensured interoperability between merchants, banks, and a new type of credit card that contained a computer chip. The chipped cards were more secure than cards that stored data on a magnetic stripe, which can be more easily copied by thieves and printed onto blank cards. Most of Europe, the Netherlands, Canada, and Mexico all moved to the new standard. The US did not. Why is the US moving to the less secure version of a more secure system? Fraud in the US was relatively low at the time and the cost of replacing readers in stores and issuing new cards to customers was high, so the country never got around to replacing those magnetic stripe cards. As a result the majority of new cards have only a magnetic stripe, only a small minority of stores are capable of reading chipped cards, and Americans traveling abroad frequently find they can’t buy metro tickets in Paris because their cards are incompatible with the machines. This is finally changing. Payments processors including Visa and MasterCard will be implementing a ""liability shift"" in October of 2015 that will place the burden of fraud on whichever party has less secure technology. In other words, the policy will penalize issuers that don’t put chips in their cards as well as stores that don’t accept chipped cards. Most chipped cards will still require a signature, not a PIN There are a lot of moving pieces in the transition, however. Stores must install new equipment; banks, credit unions, and other issuers must begin offering new cards; and customers must begin using them. Most of the new chipped cards will still have a magnetic stripe on account of the fragmented adoption of chip readers, which will prolong the changeover. In the Netherlands, a much smaller country where everyone was in agreement on the issue, it still took two years. Congressional hearings related to the Target data breach as well as a widely cited Wall Street Journal interview with a MasterCard executive triggered attention to the issue this week. Both Target CFO John Mulligan and MasterCard talked about the movement to a so-called ""chip-and-PIN system,"" implying that customers will soon be tapping in codes rather than signing receipts. That’s not the case, according to a list of chipped cards that are available now, as compiled by the credit card collectors at the forum Flyertalk. Most chipped cards will still require nothing but a signature as proof of ownership. ""The current pending US rollout of chip cards will allow use of the less secure chip-and-signature cards rather than the more secure chip and PIN cards,"" Edward Mierzwinski, consumer program director at the US Public Interest Research Group, said during a Senate hearing. ""Why not go to the higher chip-and-PIN authentication standard immediately and skip past chip and signature?"" Representatives from the banking industry say chip and signature is what consumers and merchants want: convenience and speed. Customers don’t want to have to remember a PIN for their credit cards, vice president of legislative affairs at the American Bankers Association Jason Kratovil tells The Verge. ""You've got both banks and retailers struggling with how to find the right mixture of providing security to customers, yet also the convenience that American customers expect."" Banks say Americans don't want to remember more numbers It’s debatable whether signing is significantly faster or more convenient than typing a four-digit code. Banks and card issuers do want to move toward chip-and-PIN eventually, however, in order to reduce their costs associated with fraud. A PIN could also provide another layer of protection in online or ""card not present"" transactions, where fraud has increased more rapidly. However, even chip-and-PIN technology is fallible. The system would not have prevented the Target attack, Kratovil says, in which hackers gained inside access and stole card numbers. (It would have reduced the quantity of numbers that could have been stolen, however, since the malware presumably wouldn’t have saved any information from customers using chipped cards.) Researchers at Cambridge University also demonstrated a method for duping chipped cards. And eventually, the country will move toward pay-by-phone or contactless systems, which are even further behind due to delays from companies and a lack of standards. ""Nothing is a panacea here,"" Kratovil says. ""You're talking about one piece of the bigger struggle to stay at least in step with the fraudsters if not one step ahead.""",0.45852119851858186,0.5414788014814181,0.8584191198324119,896,5.1015625,452,6.4070796460176993,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Google Fiber might control as much as 2% of the broadband market by 2015 In a letter from Comcast executive VP David L. Cohen, the company made the case that the cable industry has gotten more competitive since similar FCC rulings in the previous decade, due to an insurgent threat by Google Fiber projects and web TV services like Hulu. ""In today’s market, with national telephone and satellite competitors growing substantially,"" the letter reads, ""with Google having launched its 1 GB Google Fiber offering in a number of markets across the country, and consumers having more choice of pay TV providers than ever before, Comcast believes that there can be no justification for denying the company the additional scale that will help it compete more effectively."" Claiming Google Fiber as a competitor is, of course, ridiculous. Google's broadband project is currently only available in two markets, Kansas City and Austin, while Comcast will control 19 of the 20 largest markets in the US. Optimistic projections suggest Google Fiber might control as much as 2% of the broadband market by 2015. The pay TV provider claim has also drawn scrutiny, as the industry has seen immense consolidation in recent years, while web-based services like Hulu and Netflix have struggled to make meaningful inroads against the cable juggernauts. Overall, the point is probably moot, as Comcast has already agreed to control less than 30% of the cable industry market share in accordance with a longstanding FCC guideline. Still, the argument stands as a reminder of just how dominant Comcast is in the cable space, and how far insurgents like Google Fiber have to come before they can present a meaningful challenge.",0.7677453988973637,0.2322546011026363,0.8489938855469313,304,5.1184210526315788,186,5.946236559139785,0,0,Business,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Comcast has just made official the agreement rumored last night: it is acquiring Time Warner Cable in a multibillion-dollar deal. Officially presented as a merger between the two US cable giants, the agreement will see Comcast absorbing 100 percent of TWC in a $45.2 billion all-stock transaction. As a result, current Time Warner Cable shareholders will find themselves owning roughly 23 percent of Comcast's common stock. Monopoly concerns immediately rise to the fore with a merger of this scale, which Comcast will try to allay by making divestitures. It's acquiring TWC's 11 million managed subscribers, but says it's prepared to divest systems that serve roughly 3 million, netting it 8 million from the deal and an overall total of 30 million managed subscribers. The company says that will keep it below a 30 percent share of the US market.  ""We believe that this transaction is approvable."" In among general promises of ""a superior video experience, higher broadband speeds, and the fastest in-home Wi-Fi"" for consumers, the press release also puts a figure on the operational cost savings this merger is expected to produce: $1.5 billion. Comcast Cable CEO Neil Smit will become President and CEO of the new cable company. While the two companies have agreed to the terms of the merger, it still requires approval from shareholders and, most crucially, US regulators. Should both those groups find it acceptable, the deal is expected to be completed by the end of 2014. Update: On a conference call discussing the merger, Comcast Corporation CEO Brian Roberts downplayed the regulatory hurdles the deal faces. ""We believe that this transaction is approvable,"" Roberts said. ""It is pro-consumer, pro-competitive, and strongly in the public interest."" Because Comcast and Time Warner Cable do not currently operate in any of the same markets, Roberts suggests that competition will in no way be hampered. ""Comcast and Time Warner Cable do not compete in a single zip code in America,"" Comcast executive VP David Cohen elaborated. After the merger, Comcast would have a presence in 43 of the top 50 national markets. Because regulators are familiar with cable industry consolidation, Cohen and Roberts believe that this won't be a particularly complicated deal for them to review. ""It's going to get a careful review … but it's not going to have a more stringent review than prior transactions that this company has done,"" Cohen said. They would like to close the deal within the year, and see 9 to 12 months as a likely timeframe. There is no breakup fee between the parties should the deal not go through. Comcast also said that the deal would be beneficial to net neutrality. Select requirements of Comcast's NBCUniversal purchase would ultimately apply to Time Warner Cable under this new transaction, including requirements that it adhere to the FCC's Open Internet protections — despite them being struck down in court. ""The FCC's Open Internet order ... will continue to be binding not only in the Comcast territories but now in the Time Warner Cable footprint as well,"" Cohen said. While the Open Internet order is dead for most of the country, a successful merger would have protections binding on both Comcast and TWC — at least until they expire in 2018. Asked to speak to whether Comcast would consider extending those terms, Roberts declined to say. ""How long that goes is not something I want to speculate on today, but it's many years at the very minimum,"" he said. At the least, he feels Comcast and Time Warner Cable being subject to those conditions for any matter of years is better than the new status quo, which has no net neutrality protections that other internet providers must adhere to.

The news brings months of machinations to a close: Comcast ended up besting the efforts of the much smaller Charter Communications, which had been trying to advance its own hostile takeover of Time Warner as recently as yesterday. But with the prospect of a combined Comcast and Time Warner on the horizon, the question turns to what a merger would actually mean — both for consumers and the industry at large. If the move is approved by federal regulators, it could cement the kind of monolithic monopolies that have plagued cable subscribers all along, raising concerns over net neutrality and competition in the marketplace. Despite the very real potential for a media dystopia, however, there could be a silver lining: the chance that the deal could help break down a wall that’s kept innovation out of the living room for years. It would turn the behemoth into a titan Comcast is already the largest cable and internet provider in the United States, with 21.7 million television and 20.6 million broadband subscribers to its name. Time Warner Cable is the second-place cable service, but it’s a distant second — with 11.2 million TV and 11.1 million internet customers. Comcast will shed around 3 million of its own subscribers, thereby keeping the company’s combined television market share under 30 percent in a bid to appease regulators. Even so, with the addition of Time Warner Cable, an emboldened Comcast will suddenly have a presence in every major media market in the United States, stretching from Los Angeles to New York City. It would turn the behemoth into a titan, expanding Comcast’s reach and power in unprecedented ways. Tie in the fact that Comcast also owns NBCUniversal — which means it has a movie studio as well as broadcast and cable networks of its own — and you’re looking at a vertically integrated media juggernaut. One that wouldn’t just be in control of our televisions, but would be ready to steer the direction of any future online services as well. It’s a prospect that already has voices speaking out. Last night Free Press and Public Knowledge both issued statements condemning the prospect of the merger, calling on federal regulators to reject the deal. ""An enlarged Comcast would be the bully in the schoolyard,"" wrote Public Knowledge’s John Bergmayer, ""able to dictate terms to content creators, internet companies, other communications networks that must interconnect with it, and distributors who must access its content."" ""An enlarged Comcast would be the bully in the schoolyard."" There’s little doubt that the FCC and Department of Justice will take a close look at the implications of the deal, but at this point exactly what FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's stance will be is unclear. The DOJ and FCC were reportedly unenthused at the prospect of T-Mobile and Sprint joining forces — to the apparent surprise of both companies — arguing that the wireless industry needed more competition to benefit consumers, not less. Those concerns are harder to apply to this potential buyout — Comcast and Time Warner technically don’t compete directly thanks to regional monopolies. Naturally, Comcast itself thinks the deal won't spook regulators too much. ""We believe that this transaction is approvable,"" said Comcast CEO Brian Roberts on a conference call today. On the subject of net neutrality, Wheeler’s been vague at times. He’s embraced the rhetoric of an open, unregulated internet — a position that seems much more in line with his background as a cable and wireless-industry lobbyist — while also noting that when the pendulum swings away from the consumer’s best interests, he won’t hesitate to regulate. If anything, the Comcast and Time Warner deal will give Wheeler perhaps the first massive opportunity to make a defining statement about the guiding principles the FCC will embrace under his tenure. At the very least, Comcast is under seven years of self-imposed net neutrality terms thanks to a deal it reached when it merged with NBC (the terms end in January of 2018). Comcast said today that those rules would still apply to the larger company if the buyout is approved. Will the FCC allow the buyout to happen? For consumers, there are numerous concerns. Comcast is already a regular subject of suspicion when it comes to throttling internet speeds — it currently sits in the bottom four in Netflix’s monthly ISP speed index — and the company hasn’t been shy about giving preferential data-cap treatment to its own video apps. In theory marketplace competition should already be addressing some of these concerns, but as anyone that’s moved recently will tell you, there’s already precious little overlap between cable providers as it is. Some geographic regions have just a single provider, while others have an incumbent and a disadvantaged challenger that lacks the incumbent’s ability to spend endlessly on infrastructure improvement and content deals. Satellite providers like DirecTV aren’t a viable alternative for fast internet service, and most of the country doesn’t have access to next-generation services like Verizon’s FiOS, which even Verizon itself has said it doesn’t care to expand beyond its current market area.  Realistically, there’s no way to avoid it: approving Comcast’s purchase of Time Warner Cable would essentially rip away the already perishingly tiny hope of new competition ever emerging in the cable landscape, taking what’s been a constant frustration for consumers and cementing it into a permanent state of affairs. While the deal would turn cable into a competition dead zone, there’s actually a chance an even more monolithic Comcast could offer some benefits to customers. As broadband speeds have taken off and customers have seen the internet as a viable delivery mechanism for media, there’s been a growing cry for over-the-top video and enhanced integration with our current crop of devices. We’ve seen it succeed in dribs and drabs — HBO Go on the Apple TV here, some light Xfinity integration with the Xbox there — but there hasn’t been a true, all-encompassing solution. The bitter, brutal world of content negotiation has prevented it from moving faster. A merger could mean better internet TV options from Apple and Microsoft Intel tried in vain to negotiate deals for its own internet-based TV service before finally giving up, and according to folklore Apple’s been trying to secure broader content deals for years. Studios and networks aren’t willing to undermine their traditional business models, so the fallback option has become working with cable and satellite providers instead. But selling a next-generation integrated TV experience only really flies if it’s available to everyone; it’s hard to frame a feature as a game changer when it may work in your house, but not your cousin’s in the next state over. So instead we’ve seen halfway measures like the Xbox One’s HDMI passthrough — solutions that don’t require providers to be on board. A cable company with true nationwide reach could cut the kind of deal that would change that, providing enough subscribers to make a next-generation TV product viable and create enough market pressure to bring its competitors to the table and sign on to similar arrangements. It’s the kind of deal that could turn a new Apple TV into a set-top box that would let you watch live television — and one that Cupertino has reportedly been working on with Time Warner Cable already. With Comcast and Time Warner Cable both losing video subscribers this past year — while broadband subscribers ticked up — there’s real incentive for the new Comcast to use hardware from the likes of an Apple or Microsoft to bring new subscribers on board. Of course, the odds are just as high that we’ll see the debilitating effects of a media conglomerate run amok, mercilessly crushing any sense of fairness and competition. But one thing’s for certain: in the end, it’s going to be all about the money.",0.6108919638985228,0.38910803610147715,0.8335337523740473,1345,5.150185873605948,666,6.4054054054054053,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

It seemed the service was struggling to build a successful business, and in fact founder and CEO Joe Fernandez blogged publicly about his trials and tribulations. Six days ago Klout launched a major redesign of its website that shifted the focus towards helping users improve their scores, but it seems that the final result was a sale and soft landing. The final result was a sale and soft landing. When Klout was founded back in 2008, the world of social networks was still maturing. The giant public companies of today — Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn — were still startups. The premise of Klout seemed alluring enough: to measure people's influence across these networks and sell that information to marketers or back to the users themselves. The wrinkle was how to get people to link all their accounts to Klout so it could effectively measure and monitor them. Klout did this by assigning everyone a score and offering advertiser-backed perks like discounted meals or free T-shirts to users who created Klout profiles and had high enough scores. The drawback was that many people hated the idea of being ranked, a sort of high school popularity contest writ large across the web. Klout scores could also vary wildly, angering users who had spent months building up their stats based on a certain set of assumptions, only to have the company tweak its algorithms. Klout managed to score a big partnership with Bing, but never managed to break into the mainstream with many users beyond the marketing world. At $100M, the sale to Lithium is a passable exit. The company raised $40 million in total, with the last round valuing it at $200 million. In that sense the sale price was below what investors thought the company was worth. This could have bad fallout for employees holding shares. According to Dan Primack at Fortune, My understanding is that the deal’s actual value is ultimately tied to whatever price Lithium can get on the public market, when it goes public later this year. Klout’s investors are basically being told to expect a market cap of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion (yes, a heady prediction given where rival Jive is trading), and that the final deal will likely fall between 10% and 20% of that figure (once options and around $30 million or $40 million in cash is figured in). Worth noting that Klout’s last VC round came at a $200 million pre-money valuation, but was preferred stock (i.e., the VCs should get paid back and then some). Preferred stock guarantees the venture capitalists who invested will be paid back before anyone else. Typically, preferred shareholders get back the capital they invested, plus some multiple of the remaining profit to be split with common stockholders. That means if the sale of Klout returns $100 million on a $200 million valuation, the VCs will pocket their money, $40 million, plus a piece of the $60 million, with whatever is left over going to the company's employees.",0.2673342837036924,0.7326657162963076,0.8662229166962093,537,4.966480446927374,314,5.8789808917197455,0,0,Business,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

If you're the paranoid sort (and I am), it can be alarming too. The New York Times building is just two blocks west of where I'm sitting, but if I want to go to their website, I have to jump across three networks: starting with Time Warner, then jumping to a cable provider called CSC Holdings, then to Optimum, then to a fiber company called Abovenet, and finally the the Times servers themselves. I'd only ever heard of two of those companies before, and I have no particular reason to trust them, but here we are. Even worse, it's all delivered over plain, unencrypted HTTP, so if a mischievous network engineer at CSC wanted to drop a fake news story onto the front page, there would be nothing in the code to stop him. More ominously, an FBI agent could compel the company to drop in some tracking malware, infecting my computer as soon as I load the page. The only protection here is trust: in the ISPs, the public routing tables, the good-faith interconnections. And after Snowden, that trust is in short supply. Brazil is spending $185 million to separate itself from the American web That sudden failure of trust is why, less than a year and a half after the first leaks, Brazil is spending $185 million to separate itself from the American web. The country's new undersea data cable will allow a direct data channel to Portugal, out of reach of the US or the UK spy agencies, and establishing the country as one of the fiercest opponents of global surveillance. It's a huge undertaking, both politically and financially, but the implications for the internet could be even greater. By this logic, the internet isn't international anymore: it's American. It's American companies running data through US-made routers, and it's vulnerable to secret orders from US courts. And if Brazil wants to change that, they have to build a new internet from the ground up. Of course, there's no point building a new pipeline if your data's still headed to Gmail and Facebook, so first you have to build new services. Brazil's government has already switched its email from Microsoft to a state-owned platform called Expresso. It's a small start, but it's something. Even before Snowden, the country was encouraging a local tech industry with steep electronics tariffs. (In São Paulo, an off-contract iPhone 5s will cost you just under $1200.) But US services are hard to dislodge. Which other Facebook would you join, exactly? How else would you search for things? After you've crossed all the PRISM companies off the list, who's left? US services like Facebook and Gmail are hard to dislodge And then there's the hardware itself. Brazil is making heroic efforts to keep US-made components out of the new undersea cable, since the NSA has a history of tampering with electronics in transit, but it's hard to make the same promise with other parts of web infrastructure Suppose a Quebecois coder develops a brilliant new Gmail replacement, and he'd like to host it within Brazilian borders. Who should he call? (Remember, he can't use Amazon Web Services.) Someone else wants to set up a server farm outside Rio, but where will he buy the servers? His cousin could start up an electronics factory, but where will he get the parts? It's still a global economy, and American power is never more than a few hops away. But that’s not to say it’s impossible to build a local internet. In fact, China has already tackled every one of the challenges facing Brazil. It starts with the Great Firewall, the largest and most sophisticated censorship tool in human history, but behind that wall, China has built a remarkably self-sufficient local web. The country also has the largest and most sophisticated manufacturing sector in human history, so everything is locally made, from the phones to the servers. The government's surveillance demands have also driven Google and Twitter out of the country entirely, so now's there's Baidu and Sina Weibo, each feeding data directly to the country's censors. American power is never more than a few hops away For a long time, experts would tell you this was wrong-headed, unsustainable — but now they're not so sure. In September, Alibaba (previously known as the Chinese Amazon) raised $25 billion with the biggest IPO in history. When Sony shipped phones that used Baidu in place of Google, it was barely a scandal. Getting data across the Great Firewall is still unreliable, so companies are increasingly willing to host services inside the country, playing off a growing web services industry. The local Chinese web is a permanent fixture now, and seen through the right eyes, it looks an awful lot like the future. Of course, none of this will do anti-surveillance advocates much good. You can escape NSA surveillance by moving over to the Chinese web, but you’d be jumping into an even more powerful and invasive surveillance state. Still, if you want to see what the internet looks like without trust, this is it. From cables to servers, every link leads back to the same central authority. Every service is accountable to the same power. Keeping the NSA off Brazil's local net will take force, and that may be incompatible with the loose networks and casual anonymity we associate with today's web. It's the same old two-step between freedom and security, played out at the level of a network protocol. Of course, there are lots of things we could do to improve both — starting with HTTPS everywhere, which would lock down the data in transit. But soon, the carefree stroll from network to network may start to look awfully naive.",0.29131047384852293,0.7086895261514771,0.8594186956878059,976,4.8452868852459012,521,5.9596928982725528,0,0,"US & World, Essay, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Their painted signs are too small to read from a distance, but it’s easier to see what’s written on the cordons they’ve used to form two lines: FAST LANE and SLOW LANE. To anyone familiar with internet discourse, it’s clear what’s going on: a protest in favor of net neutrality, a contentious issue that’s supposed to be voted on by the FCC later this year. The ""fast lane"" refers to companies that could pay ISPs for faster service in a world without meaningful rules; the ""slow lane"" is everyone else. But the signs aren’t just telling people to save the internet. In the fast lane, they’re a mix of celebrity gossip (""Extra nonsense: Jay-Z, Beyonce, Solange"") and sensationalized headlines. In the slow lane, there’s news about Israeli bombings and the shooting of black teenagers Michael Brown and Vonderrick Myers by St. Louis police. A fast lane sign says ""riots grip city,"" its slow-lane equivalent says ""community rises up against police brutality."" ""Riots grip city"" This rally is the prelude to ""New York Speaks,"" an unofficial hearing organized by reform groups Free Press, Common Cause, and several others. The hearing is meant to let New Yorkers voice their concerns about how the FCC is regulating the internet in general, but there are two major issues on the table: a proposed merger between cable giants Comcast and Time Warner Cable, and an impending net neutrality vote. It’s been almost a year since courts struck down most of the FCC’s Open Internet Order, leaving agency chair Tom Wheeler scrambling to replace it with new rules. His vague, controversial proposal drew a record 3.7 million public comments, and supporters of net neutrality have held both physical protests and online days of action in support of stricter regulation. Former commissioner Michael Copps, currently an advisor for Common Cause, says the agency needs to be reminded of what’s at stake for citizens — allowing companies to pay for faster data or ISPs to discriminate between services would ""not only really mock the potential power of the internet to improve our lives, but would be a real blow to our democracy,"" he says. As those 3.7 million comments indicate, quite a few people have already let the FCC know how they feel. But the meeting in Brooklyn is marked by its focus on — or even just its prominent inclusion of — people who don’t fit the stereotypical (usually white and male) ""generic internet user"" template. Dragonfly, a local activist emceeing the proceedings in a long blue jacket and bright red afro, was part of the mid-October ""weekend of resistance"" in Ferguson, where cameras captured her embracing a police officer in the midst of the demonstration. Here, she leads the crowd in chants — and a public prayer to ""the deities of the interwebs"" — before ushering them inside the library to testify about how the internet has changed their lives.  Opinions on net neutrality usually split down party lines, but in mainstream debate, we often end up discussing it in apolitical terms: a world where cable companies could control internet speeds could be a world where it’s harder to watch Netflix or look at cat pictures or load Pornhub. It’s a practical and non-threatening tactic, appealing to the interests that unite many people online, and the Silicon Valley bubble is an undeniably powerful thing to have on your side. But it can also make net neutrality seem like a trivial political aside. Yes, throttling House of Cards would be indefensible, but not a human rights violation. More importantly, it whitewashes the differences between aspiring Mark Zuckerbergs and everyone else — differences that can and should affect the larger debate. Use of wireless and wired broadband, for example, is divided along racial lines. A 2013 Pew survey found that 74 percent of white respondents had home broadband service, compared to only 64 percent of black and 53 percent of Hispanic ones. Counting smartphone data as broadband service (as internet service giants like Comcast do) virtually closes that gap. But the old net neutrality rules were much less strict for mobile data, and carriers will be fighting hard to keep it that way, despite recent opposition. Helping the next big startup compete is a worthy idea with broad appeal, but it doesn’t cover the entire debate. The hearing, which opens with slam poetry and closes with a rendition of ""Keep Your Eyes on the Prize,"" creates space to talk about more personal, less commercial issues. One person talks about finding queer online communities as a teenager, and others describe projects that will never be big enough to pay for prioritization, like sites that document police brutality. The protests in Ferguson — where news got out via social media and small livestreams when traditional networks were seen as slow or untrustworthy — are a running thread through the testimony. In less specific ways, speakers talk about the increasingly central role of the internet in public life, whether that means applying for government aid or communicating from prison.  Granted, these aren’t simply random community members — most use the event to mention a larger activism group, although one young man identifies himself simply as ""unofficially representing gamers and metalheads."" And alongside them are speakers from Etsy and Kickstarter, as well as a handful of New York politicians like Manhattan City Borough President Gale Brewer — Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has previously urged the FCC to treat broadband as a utility, sent a member of his staff to speak. Through the whole event, five conspicuously empty chairs sit beside the podium, each labeled with the name of an FCC commissioner. While they remain unfilled, Mignon Clyburn, who briefly served as chair last year, did send a pre-recorded video. Clyburn, the first black woman to become a commissioner, is a clear supporter of net neutrality — she and colleague Jessica Rosenworcel have criticized Wheeler for not going far enough on the issue. But she gets a chilly reception at the hearing. As she reaches the end of her short speech, assuring listeners that ""your voices will be heard,"" the crowd laughs. ""Thanks for listening to us!"" one man shouts back sardonically. The FCC's decision is still uncertain The FCC, in fact, may still not be close to a decision. Anonymous sources said last week that Wheeler was considering four proposals, one of which was a vague hybrid plan that would treat the backbone of the internet like a utility but leave the last mile between ISPs and consumers more loosely regulated, albeit with a ban on paid prioritization unless it’s found ""just and reasonable."" It’s not the full common carrier reclassification that almost all net neutrality activists are looking for, and groups across the board have criticized it, saying that it would leave room for ""fast lanes"" and might not even stand up in court. One of the few theoretical winners would be Netflix, whose connections with ISPs could be treated like a utility. Unfortunately,  we don’t even know when a plan will be announced — it could be as early as this month, or as late as next year, breaking the agency’s informal end-of-2014 deadline. Even under the best-case scenario, the FCC will have to craft more nuanced rules based on whatever framework it adopts, and unless it gives up on net neutrality entirely, it’s likely to be mired in lawsuits for years to come. Which is to say, there will be more protests, more debates, more public discussion of what net neutrality should be. But if New York Speaks demonstrates one thing, it’s that the loudest voices aren’t necessarily the most interesting.

First and most significant is the addition of a new donation notification, which will appear at the top of every Facebook user's News Feed over the next week. It'll be a simple message with an option to directly contribute to the funds of one of three non-profit organizations working in West Africa at the moment: the Red Cross, International Medical Corps, and Save the Children. You can use PayPal or a Visa or MasterCard to complete the payment. Facebook will also push awareness-raising UNICEF messages to the News Feeds of people in the West African countries most affected by Ebola. These will contain basic information about the typical symptoms of the disease and direct those suspecting they might be infected to go to the nearest health facility. Finally, Facebook is donating 100 mobile satellite communication terminals, which will be deployed in the most remote and infrastructure-deprived areas of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to provide voice and data services where they are most lacking.  This level of activism and involvement is unusual for Facebook and would seem to reflect the seriousness of the Ebola epidemic that's currently ongoing. The company says it ""could become a long-term global health crisis"" if it's not urgently addressed and contained. No other social network has Facebook's immense reach, and efforts to raise awareness and participation in the fight against Ebola will surely be amplified by its audience of 1.3 billion users. This also sets an important precedent for Facebook as a public body exercising a social conscience — which may come to be questioned if the company isn't equally active in addressing other calamities in the future.

A way to fire ""unlimited"" rounds Machinist Michael Crumling has started hand-crafting lead bullets encased in thick, steel shells, which contain the force from a blast inside of the bullet, rather than transferring it to the body of the weapon. The result, he says, is the .314 Atlas: a way to fire ""unlimited"" rounds through a cheap plastic weapon — a boon to a DIY gun enthusiasts, and a potential headache for law enforcement. Crumling's gun was printed on an economical, $400 Printrbot, with a few metal parts added, but that doesn't mean it was simple to make the ammo. Although the materials cost only 27 cents a round and can be fired multiple times, Crumling told Wired, each round takes an hour to make. He doesn't plan to sell the rounds, but he's making the plans available on his website. The ammo is hardly the first attempt to make a 3D-printed firearm that doesn't go to pieces. A weapon 3D-printed from metal reportedly fires more than 50 rounds, but the cost of creating it was prohibitively expensive and difficult for most.

Palo Alto's researchers have discovered a bug called Wirelurker, which the company says may have already impacted hundreds of thousands of users. The bug is primarily spreading through the Maiyadi App Store, a third-party source for OS X software in China, and researchers estimated the infected apps have been downloaded 356,104 times already. Once the computer is infected, Wirelurker spreads to iOS devices that connect over USB, rewriting existing programs on the device through binary file replacement. It's the first such bug that can infect iPhones that haven't been jailbroken, using the rarely examined enterprise provisioning system, intended to allow large companies to deploy software without going through the app store approval process. Everything I've read so far in the WireLurker white paper seems not only completely plausible, but easy to pull off with libimobiledevice.  Ironically, once Wirelurker gains access to a non-jailbroken iPhone, the program simply side-loads a non-malicious comic book app onto the phone, using a forged enterprise provisioning certificate. Palo Alto researchers suspect it's a test payload to ensure the system works before moving on to more profitable ends. For jailbroken phones, the malware rewrites the apps for the TaoBao and AliPay apps (Alibaba's applications for auctions and payments, respectively) so as to harvest payment information. But even with its current limitations, the bug represents the first serious compromise of iOS security, and presents security researchers with a number of novel attack vectors that must now be secured. Palo Alto Networks has already developed software that will let users test for the bug, but in the meantime, they recommend users avoid third-party app stores and avoid using USB-based chargers from unknown sources.

Alaska's measure passed by a slight majority Tuesday, with about 52 percent of the vote and 97 percent of precincts reporting. Under the initiative, adults 21 and older can have up to one ounce of marijuana and six plants, with production and sales regulated by a state commission. It won't go into effect until 90 days after the election has been certified, and the state will then have 18 months to implement regulations.   Oregon's ballot, Measure 91, allows anyone over the age of 21 to possess up to eight ounces of weed and four marijuana plants. Production and sales will be regulated by the state's liquor board, with tax revenues going toward enforcement and education initiatives. The initiative calls for marijuana to be legalized by July 1st, 2015, and for the state liquor board to implement regulations by January 1st, 2016. The District of Columbia's measure isn't as expansive — adults 21 and over can legally possess two ounces and six plants — and it does not allow for sales or taxation, since voter measures by law cannot impact the DC budget.

From December to February, according to Business Insider, he also worked for private spaceflight company SpaceX. In its complaint, the FBI says that he was found in part because he had supplied his own email address (""blake@benthall.net"") for a Silk Road 2.0 server, and had contacted the server's service provider or accessed invoices without anonymizing software. According to various records, he received a steady Bitcoin income as well, at one point putting down $70,000 in bitcoin as a down payment for a Tesla Model S. He will appear today in federal court, charged with one count of conspiring to commit narcotics trafficking, one count of conspiring to commit computer hacking, one count of conspiring to traffic in fraudulent identification documents, and one count of money laundering conspiracy.   According to the FBI, Silk Road 2 had roughly 150,000 active users and had sales of $8 million per month as of September 2014; officials once claimed that nearly a million were registered on the old Silk Road. It was brought down after being infiltrated by an undercover Homeland Security agent, who gained access to administrative functions and regularly interacted with Benthall. If convicted, Benthall faces up to life in prison. He's the second alleged Silk Road operator to be taken down in a drug bust; Ross Ulbricht, who the FBI claims ran the first site under the alias ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" was arrested and indicted in 2013. More charges have been added since then, and currently, his trial is set to begin in January of 2015. Authorities have been aware of Silk Road 2 since the beginning, and its shutdown occurred precisely one year after it began; on Reddit, some users briefly speculated that the seizure was simply site maintenance or a denial of service attack. The service had apparently been hacked in February, losing $2.7 million in bitcoin. While the Silk Road name was once synonymous with online drug markets, the first site's shutdown launched a plethora of imitators, making Silk Road 2 merely one of many options.

Splatoon is the most surprising release from Nintendo in years. It's an online-focused, competitive shooter where groups of players team up to fight each other across a series of battle arenas. But at the same time, it's a bright, colorful game about strange creatures who are part squid, part human, and can alternate between the two at will. It's essentially Call of Duty with a Nintendo makeover, and it's proof that Nintendo needs to experiment more often. Those odd squid creatures — called inklings — are the heart of the experience. What makes Splatoon so distinct, and so distinctly Nintendo, is how its characters feel totally different from any other shooter. For starters, you aren't firing bullets, you're shooting paint-like ink. In multiplayer, the goal isn't to decimate your opponents, but to cover the stage with as much satisfyingly goopy ink as possible (each four-person team has a color, and you want to cover the level in more of your colorful ink than that of your opponent). It’s less about finding and shooting your opponents, and more about constantly moving and firing at everything, even the floor. This opens up an otherwise intimidating genre to new players. You don't have to be a particularly good shot to enjoy — or contribute to — a multiplayer match in Splatoon. It doesn't take a whole lot of skill to shoot paint at the floor. In fact, there's even an option for those who don't want to play the game as a shooter at all; eventually you'll unlock a giant roller that lets you paint the level and steamroll opponents without pulling a trigger. It's become my non-weapon of choice. This focus on accessibility doesn't mean there isn't room for skill in the game; you can still ""splat"" opponents, forcing them to respawn back at their base. And I found myself on the receiving end of more than a few quick, sneaky kills at the hands of more talented players. But it's not frustrating the way it is in more traditional shooters, because it's not just a cycle of die, respawn, repeat. If you're no good at sniping opponents, you can contribute in other ways, finding hidden areas in need of a good paint job. And for the time-constrained, the matches are only a few minutes long, making it easy to squeeze some Splatoon into a busy schedule. Splatoon is also a game that just feels good to move around in. Just like Titanfall, the emphasis is on speed and never standing in one spot for too long. While you're in humanoid form, the game feels like a fairly traditional third-person shooter, but when you switch to a squid, it becomes something altogether different. As a squid you can swim through your color of ink (going through your opponents’ ink is like swimming through glue), which not only makes you move faster, but also refills your ink supply for when you get back to shooting. It feels a bit like skateboarding; you can slide up ramps and walls, and make big jumps across gaps. Not coincidentally, most of the stages are set-up like skateparks, letting you grind along as if you’re playing a squid-themed Tony Hawk. The game features a few different modes to play, but the core of the experience is online. The local multiplayer options are limited to a disappointing one-on-one game, and the single-player campaign is fun and occasionally really clever, but pretty light. I've played the game for around 15 hours and the vast majority of that was spent in four-on-four battles online. Nintendo doesn't have the greatest track record with online games, but, at least for the pre-launch version I played, Splatoon works remarkably well. I didn't experience any lag or disconnects, and while features like voice chat are missing — a controversial decision by Nintendo — I found I didn't really mind. Just like in the voice chat-less Hearthstone, it was actually kind of pleasant not to have to listen to strangers jabber away. Meanwhile, Splatoon really nails the progress loop, offering new weapons as you level up and new gear to buy every day. Even the stages rotate every few hours to keep things fresh. Splatoon isn't just refreshing for the way it plays, but also for how it looks. Online shooters are dominated by realistic, grim, and grey war games like Call of Duty and Battlefield. Splatoon's paint-splattered, skate punk vibe feels  different. It's sort of like a kid-friendly version of Sunset Overdrive, with plenty of bright colors and lots of visual customization options for your character. The inklings themselves are well-designed. The female inkling, for example, has long, flowing hair that on second glance you will notice is actually made of tentacles. Throw on a backwards hat and some slick sneakers and she becomes a pretty badass paintball warrior. (The great new characters also result in what are possibly the best amiibos yet.) It's a lot of fun just to check out the shops — there's an in-game mall full of clothes — and try on different outfits. I probably wasted far too much time picking out the perfect hat. What's perhaps most remarkable about Splatoon is how it is both a game that's completely different from anything Nintendo has made before, yet a game that still feels incredibly Nintendo-like. It includes features that just seem like they couldn't come from any other developer. For example, when you're waiting for a match you can play a retro arcade game on the Gamepad to kill time. In the game’s social hub you can check out other players’ outfits, and the game actually gives you the option to order anything that catches your eye. Like with any online game, the question is whether Splatoon will hold up over the long run. Nintendo is planning on adding new content to the game every few weeks, including new weapons and stages, which should help. In August the game will get a new battle mode and some additional, team-focused matchmaking options, and all of the extra content will be free to download. That's no guarantee that the game will garner the community needed to keep it interesting for months or longer, but Nintendo has created a fantastic base to build off of. Splatoon is a game that takes one of the most intimidating genres and reimagines it as something anyone can play. And it proves that Nintendo can still surprise. Splatoon is available May 29th on the Wii U.

Your GOGOT correspondent has corrected this and updated the charts accordingly. This took a really long time. I hope you're happy.] In the Game of Game of Thrones, sometimes you wish you could just draft Winter. It makes an appearance or gets shouted out pretty much every week, and every character is mortally afraid of it. And no matter how brutal or foreboding it is, it doesn't try to rape anyone. Winter also killed 50 of Stannis Baratheon's men on their march down to defeat the Boltons, so everyone's favorite thinkpiece subject Sansa Stark might have to chill, so to speak, in her miserable marital predicament for a few more weeks. This is not great news, but as Theon / Reek pointed out, no matter how bad things are, they can always get worse. Cool insight, Reek! I hope you don't mind that we here at GOGOT headquarters are just going to go ahead and stick to your new name, since it appears that no matter how noble a pep talk you're given by your surrogate little sister, you're still pretty much worthless in a co-conspirator capacity (+10 to Sansa for a good, if fruitless effort). At least Winter doesn't try to rape anyone So Ramsay Bolton's still peacefully doing gross, horrible stuff in Winterfell (+10 for flaying that poor old lady; this must be what it feels like to have drafted Ray Rice in 2014), and Melisandre is still being her crazy wild card self, this time suggesting that Stannis sacrifice his beloved daughter Shireen to the Lord of Light to bolster his claim to the throne. Wow. +10 for boldness, Mel. It kind of feels like at this point she's just making up a bunch of extreme-sounding shit and seeing what sticks, and indeed, Stannis is all ""are you just making up extreme-sounding shit?"" Who knows, we may have to take the Lord of Light off the board entirely if the seams continue to show themselves like this.   Way to drop the mic on human existence Winter may have also been partially to blame for the death of Aemon Targaryen, though that was probably just Old Age (which would be a pretty worthless draft pick from a body count standpoint, this week notwithstanding). Too bad nobody had Aemon drafted, because his last words, in a hallucinated exchange with his little brother Aeg (her?) were an all-time-best Game of Thrones line: ""I dreamed I was old."" Way to drop the mic on human existence. After his passing, as well as the departure of Jon Snow, Samwell Tarly and Gilly are more or less stranded, at the mercy of all the unpleasant characters that populate Castle Black. Rape shows up again, but is thwarted by Ghost, who makes a classic direwolf ex machina appearance and scares the rape away (+10). Afterwards, Gilly shows her gratitude to Sam for not getting raped by offering him consensual sex (+25 each). Seems like not the wisest move — Isn't the breaking of your Night's Watch vows punishable by death? And don't a lot of guys want Sam dead right now? — but we can't fault two put-upon characters for trying to treat each other nicely in an upside-down world.   Let's get out of the north, where Winter and Old Age and Rape still appear to have free, boring reign. Let's go to Dorne, where I was genuinely shocked to see Jaime Lannister in a comfortable chamber with lots of light after his attempted kidnapping of Myrcella. Those Dornish, so civilized! Jaime has a long-time-no-see chat with his niece / daughter (""You had more hair,"" she says uncomfortably; ""And more hands,"" he quips — +5 — summing up his character arc very succinctly). It turns out she has very little attachment or loyalty to King's Landing these days — it's all about her dreamy Trystane Martell. ""You don't know me,"" she spits at Jaime (+10), which is a classic deadbeat dad burn and also pretty much exactly what her mother said at the top of the season. Take it from Don Draper, Jaime — you can't just decide to be a dad when it suddenly feels convenient or makes you feel better about your track record as a parent, especially when your daughter doesn't even know she's your illegitimate incest lovechild. (Man, the last season of Mad Men got weird!) Oh, also, here's your weekly -10 for still being stuck in this dumb plotline. +10 to Myrcella for a classic deadbeat dad burn Meanwhile, in the dungeons, Bronn is singing and relaxing and flirting with the Sand Snakes, one of whom is — kind of horrifically, if I'm being honest — flirting back with him. Man, what was that scene? Last week I asked the Sand Snakes to step it up; I did not mean ""devolve into hot and comfortably useless warrior babe stereotypes."" Tyene Sand got some dialogue and some nudity points (+15), sure, but she didn't do anything as badass as let Bronn die from the cut from her poisoned blade (not that we would have been able to forgive that, either). What did we learn about her? That she wanted to let Bronn know that she has breasts? (If you are still wondering what they feel like, Bronn, here's a guess.) Obara and Nymeria Sand's idle eye-rolling did nothing to mitigate this lazily and pervily conceived encounter. -10 to all y'all (Bronn, Obara, Nym, and Tyene) for your weekly participation in this mess. Okay, Dorne, that's enough of that. Let's go to Meereen, where Daenerys Targaryen is still cuddling with her snuggle bunny Daario Naharis, former sellsword and current professional tagline generator (""All rulers are either butchers or meat."" ""You are the only person in Meereen who isn't free."" +10.) They get PG-13 naked (+5) and do sex (+15). Daario is just jealous of Hizdahr zo Loraq, which he SHOULD be, because Hizdahr is objectively better than Daario, and when was the last time Dany rocked such a striking new look (+10) for her lowborn beau? Hizdahr is trying so hard to get his boo into sports Hizdahr and Dany visit the local fighting pit farm team, and Hizdahr is trying so hard to get his boo into his favorite sport, but she isn't having it. That is, until Jorah Mormont shows up and K.O.s five fighting pitmen (+25) and then takes off his helm and reveals himself to his Khaleesi. She responds by joining a proud tradition of platinum blonde women bellowing ""GET OUT"" at dudes, but before the guards can drag Jorah away, out pops Tyrion Lannister! Tyrion made it to Daenerys! Your GOGOT correspondent won't deny getting a chill during this moment; so many of Game of Thrones' most elemental thrills happen when this big sprawling world finds a way to fold back on itself — the last instance that comes to mind is Stannis' army charging across the north. When was the last time someone accomplished a goal on this show? +25 to Tyrion for finishing a project!   Shade so subtle it doesn't even transcribe properly That seemed as good as any a note to end on this week, but oh no — we still had to catch up with Cersei Lannister's glorious self-immolation. If Jaime Lannister is the twisted version of a fairy tale prince, then Cersei is his logical princess, surrounding herself with a team of sparrows that cheerfully tie a noose around her neck. After giving a heartfelt speech to (the still useless) Tommen Baratheon about all the things she'd do for his happiness, she goes and visits Margaery Baratheon in her red cell, where — dang! — the queen seems to be quickly deteriorating. The whole visit easily wins +15, every line dripping with shade so subtle it doesn't even transcribe properly when unaccompanied by Lena Headey's eyebrows. It's a draw between Margaery's cold-as-ice ""Perhaps that's why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me,"" and endlessly GIF-able ""Get out, you hateful bitch!"" (+5) It's also, let's be real, a bit of a pity score, because we all knew Cersei's alliance with the Faith Militant could only last so long. The chain of cause and effect that threw the Unbreakable Cersei Lannister in a prison cell is long and years in the making, but we at least have to give some credit to Littlefinger, who — who knows? — might have nudged Lancel Lannister toward the Sparrows years ago, with this exact outcome in mind. He did imply that the confession was his ""gift"" to Olenna Tyrell (+15). But Lancel's betrayal of his aunt falls right on the boundary of the hefty +35 ""betray someone you're sleeping with"" score. Usually I'd dock some points since Cersei is in fact no longer sleeping with Lancel, but given that the betrayal directly concerns the sleeping-with (as well as the regicide and who knows what else) I'd say the full score applies. For the first time, it feels like a Cersei threat may be empty And what's this? No +10 for Cersei's last threatening words before the sisters lock her away? Nope — for the first time, it feels like a Cersei threat may in fact be empty; there's no Lannister debt to pay back, because at its root, her punishment was self-inflicted. It's a complex bummer to see such a resiliently evil, yet endlessly entertaining, and yes, kind of sympathetic character get her due, but the universe has clearly had it in for her since she visited that witch as a child. And some might say that in the Game of Game of Thrones, as in life, the Universe is the most powerful draft pick of all.

Since the audience (both in studio and eventually on cable TV) can't see the video feed, UCB artistic director Shannon O'Neill and Broad City's other half Abbi Jacobson are acting as sketch artists based on Gethard and Glazer's dictation. Jacobson's in particular is strikingly accurate — ""If that thing had a hat on, that would be it,"" quips Gethard, which prompts Jacobson to jump and scream, ""I am a genital wizard!""  There is no show on TV like The Chris Gethard Show — that, I can say with confidence. A talk show in the loosest sense of the term, it’s more in kind with experimental fare like Comedy Bang Bang than a traditional late night variety hour. The format can vary wildly from episode to episode, but in general Gethard and celebrity guests — primarily comedians — take phone calls around a specific theme (e.g. weird body parts) and partake in improvised segments. Traditional jokes are few and far between; it mines its humor from uncomfortable truths and unplanned moments of awkwardness, but it always embraces the positive — nothing here is framed as exploitative. The set itself, designed to look intentionally grungy, is lined with fan-submitted art and other trinkets. Gethard is flanked by dozens of fans who sit on stage the whole show, along with his usual crew that includes O'Neill, announcer Murf Meyer, house band the llc, ""internet liaison"" Bethany Hall (who hangs out in the online chat room from the stage during the entire taping), perpetual hoops dancer Mimi, and the Human Fish, an incredibly hairy individual who occasionally chimes to answer absurdist ""This or That?"" questions. To put it another way, The Chris Gethard Show is a show that encourages weirdness. Gethard has been shepherding the passion project for four years on a New York City public access channel (TCGS has a devoted following online and is planning to livestream its tapings in full). In many ways, it’s a reflection of the host himself, who, in addition to the show, has released a handful of books and a comedy album. Gethard has never been shy about his ambition to bring TCGS to a national audience, and this Thursday he'll finally get his chance when it premieres on cable channel Fusion. A week before the first taping of the new show, I sat down with Gethard for a wide-ranging chat about TCGS and his career up until this point. Some highlights are below, but we'd recommend you listen to the full audio interview (available here and embedded above). The Chris Gethard Show will play Thursdays at 10PM  on Fusion starting this week (May 28th) through the end of the summer. The tapings will be livestreamed in their entirety each Tuesday prior to the premiere. Full episodes will be released online the next Friday after (so... June 5th for the first one). Cool? Cool. I'm curious about how this version of The Chris Gethard Show is going to be different than before. At least in the build up to the first episode, does it feel any different for you? Is the pressure different? I think the pressure's definitely there. By and large it's been very healthy and very motivating and positive. There's definitely been a few moments of stress where I've been like, ""Oh my God, can I pull this off?"" Not even ""can we"", because the people surrounding the show and the people who kind of help lift it up and get it to where it needs to go — I have really a lot of faith in them. It's mostly just in myself. We did this show on public access for about four years. We were at the UCB Theater for another year or so before that. For like five, six years, I've been talking a real good game about get me on TV, give me a real chance to do it and I'll just prove a lot of people wrong. I'll prove a lot of things. Now I have to actually go do it. It's like, I talked a lot of smack along the way. Now I have to actually deliver. How would you describe The Chris Gethard Show to a complete newcomer? At the very basic level, I'll tell them, it's a really weird talk show. I think the things we try to do that make it really different are twofold. It's all about audience accessibility to me. Interactivity-wise, I want them to really feel like they can leave their fingerprints on it. We just relentlessly try to think of ways that some kid watching at home can have an actual effect on the show. Not in a small way; in a really direct, discernible, visible way. Now I'm going to get excited and start to ramble, but I think TV is traditionally, ""They send it out and then you watch it in your living room,"" and that's the experience. That's not really how young people experience things today. Now they get to comment, they get to interact, they get to guide it. I want to be a TV show that embraces that. I think the other major difference between us and other talk shows is we really try to do things that disarm ourselves and the audience at times. I want to present something where it's clear we don't know exactly what's going to happen, it's clear that the celebrity is really letting their guard down and experiencing something… It's not guided by a publicist, it's not guided by a pre-interview, you get to see these people and how they really react to things. With public access, you had surprisingly few limits and a devoted internet following, but now you’re going to cable. Is Fusion giving you any limits beyond what cable access gave you, which was surprisingly little? A very small handful of limits. Public access, there were really no rules. Really the only rule we had was just don't get naked in the studio. If you need to get naked, pre-tape it. We don't want naked people putting their naked parts on our stuff in the studio. That really was the only rule. There were a few others, and they didn't even hold us to them. Fusion, there's a few more. Fusion I think is the right place for us in many ways. They are clearly an underdog network, and we're an underdog show. I think they're really staking out their claim, and I'm really psyched to be a part of that because that's always been my attitude. At the end of the day, they are co-owned by Univision and ABC. That ABC thing kicks all the way up the chain to Disney. Technically we are under the same corporate umbrella as Star Wars now. There are no jokes in the show, which is maybe a testament to where you come from in comedy. But there's a lot of humor just by merit of being in an awkward and honest situation. I don't like jokes. I don't like a thing where it's like I know you want me to laugh and then I have to laugh or not laugh. I'd rather give them something else. I really started years ago ... When I was an improviser, this started. I think it extended when I converted and became a stand up. I really loved the idea of making people laugh. At the end of the day that is what I crave when I get on stage or on camera in any way, but I like the idea of trying to give them laughter plus something else that's less certain. I love Andy Kaufman. I always feel like you weren't exactly sure how you were supposed to react. David Letterman, I feel like a lot of his stuff, like you're laughing —  but also, he seems like he's being kind of mean to this guest. Why are you hassling your deli guy? I find it really funny, but that's really just the deli guy. I don't know exactly how to feel about that.  TV in particular, so much of TV is structured in a way where it's like ""here's the joke and now you laugh."" Here's the laugh track to remind you to laugh ... I'd rather put trust in our audience. It also feels just feels like that's kind of a progression of where we have seen comedy go in the last few years — single camera, very few laugh tracks, standup comics that are getting big, more storytellers. I think the monologue is one of the last bastions of the talk show format. Even to an extent, Twitter has kind of become the replacement for that. I think so in a big way. That's like I was saying before. I think just modern viewers, younger people than me, they grew up where almost all the entertainment they consumed in their formative years had a box underneath where they could leave comments on it. Most of the celebrities they really love, they follow on platforms where when the celebrity says something, 10 seconds later they can write back and be like, that wasn't funny. That's just part of the enjoyment for them. #TCGS held a fetish party where I was stomped, cake battered, and lit on fire. All sexually. Here's a great edit! https://t.co/3aEE8Tl2US [Before Fusion], were there other offers? There's a near-mythical Comedy Central pilot that some comedy circles still talk about. Yeah. We shot a pilot for Comedy Central. I was really proud of it, think it went really well. I watch it and there's a lot of things I really like about it. I think ultimately it was not a Comedy Central vehicle. The idea that we're going to take calls and it was going to be totally chaotic, I don't think it was quite something they were ready to take a chance on. That's fine. A lot of the people there have been very kind to me, and I don't begrudge them. [Still,] I was a little surprised. I felt like the pilot went really well. Our pilot taping, a girl flew from Brazil, kids came from San Francisco, from Honolulu, from Canada to attend a pilot taping. All the Comedy Central people on the set were like, what's going on? I was just like, we are not trying to create buzz when we say we have a cult audience. We don't have a huge audience, but they will fly from Brazil to come do this thing. It was cool. They were impressed. Then I think you start to send it up the chain where corporate people and marketing people see it. They're like, we don't know exactly what to do with this. It makes sense to me, it's a very new thing. It's very different. I'm proud of that. I understand it. Ultimately it wasn't for them. We had meetings with so many other people. Can you name any of them? IFC actually gave me this big development deal where for a year they made me their public face of their marketing and optioned me to write a script based on a book that I wrote a couple years ago. They wouldn't ... They had us pitch the Gethard show three times. Even a company that was making me their public face for a year — me, Chris Gethard, they wanted to be the face of their advertisement. They called it an adopt-a-comic program where they were adopting me for a year, making me their guy — would not do The Chris Gethard Show, which to me felt so crazy. They basically gave me a salary for a year where I kept working on it on public access and didn't feel that total financial [fear] ... So many times where I was like, ""I need to move to LA just because I can't pay the rent,"" IFC saved me. I give them so many thanks for that. I kept working on the show for a year while they did it.  I did a lot of other stuff for them too. I wasn't just stealing their money. IFC was a big one. There were a bunch of [networks] that were very nice and tried to maybe workshop their version of the idea in a way that I appreciate, but ultimately wasn't right for me. Then there were a few other networks that were just like, ""This is really out there. This is not our thing."" Let's look farther in the future. If this doesn't get picked up, is this the end of The Chris Gethard Show? Is this where you move [into] standup and storytelling? I feel like if it doesn't get picked up, it is the end of The Chris Gethard Show only because... I think I kind of legendarily have thrown myself against the wall trying to make it happen for five years now. It's finally happening in a way that I always hoped it would. I actually feel like it would be reflective of mental illness if I kept trying to do it after this. I feel like I will be at peace with how this goes. A lot of that is because Fusion is cool enough — they're letting us do it our way in a real sense where I won't walk away from this being like, ""Well, that wasn't the show I really wanted to do."" This'll be the show I really wanted to do. They're not trying to interfere with that at all. They're empowering me to go do the show I want to do. I'll be able to walk away. I feel like if it doesn't get picked up, the real question for me is do I keep doing comedy? Do I go to Los Angeles? Do I do more stand up? Or... Do I just disappear and move back to New Jersey and try to have a couple kids and be happy — just work a regular job and let this be my legacy and know that I tried? That, to me, is the big question. My wife is like, you talk a good game. She's like, you would go insane if you didn't get to be creative. I think I've kind of gone insane while I've been creative so I don't know that there's a way out of that. I don't know. Maybe it's easy to get caught up in [everything], but... I kind of feel like this show is the reason why I got into this. Looking at from when I started when I was 19, 20 years old until now, this show really has helped connect me with people. I think it's given people something. I don't know if I'll ever do that again, I don't know that I have the energy or the ideas to do that again. Maybe this is all I needed to do — in a hopeful way. I don't want it to be a bummer and sad. I want it to be ""mission accomplished. I did this thing that I wanted to do."" It was weird. When I started at UCB when I was 20, I remember feeling like, ""I just want to be able to make the type of thing that I would've loved when I was 15."" This is that show.

So he hopes it will be Fight Club.” Author Chuck Palahniuk is on the other end of the phone, and I’m struggling to match the calm, thoughtful voice I’m hearing with chaotic novels like Choke, Invisible Monsters — and of course, Fight Club. It’s the day before Palahniuk leaves on a book tour promoting his new collection of short stories, Make Something Up: Stories You Can’t Unread, but at the moment we’re talking about David Fincher’s aspirations for the Fight Club musical.  “He’s got Trent Reznor working on the score for one year. And after a year they expect to have enough of the primary songs to start putting it together,” he tells me. “David is working with Julie Taymor to figure out how to create these enormous spectacles as she does, similar to The Lion King and Spiderman. So that’s David’s big dream.”  Palahniuk is talking a lot about his 1996 debut novel lately — and David Fincher’s film adaptation starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Not only does its antihero Tyler Durden show up in a short story from Make Something Up, but the author has written a graphic novel sequel to Fight Club, with the first issue arriving today. It picks up years after the original novel ended, with the narrator — this time he goes by “Sebastian” — married to Marla Singer and navigating suburban fatherhood. As one might expect, cracks begin to show, and both Tyler Durden and the anarchist self-help group Project Mayhem soon return to the forefront. I chatted with Palahniuk about the sequel, what it was like working in a new medium, and why Fight Club continues to entice new readers. Bryan Bishop: It’s been nearly 20 years since the original Fight Club novel came out. What made now the right time to revisit these characters? Chuck Palahniuk: One of my best friends, the thriller writer Chelsea Cain — who writes the Heartsick series and the Kick Lannigan series — she knows a lot of comic people here in Portland. And she threw a dinner party where she kinda set me up on a blind date with [comic writers] Matt Fraction and Brian Bendis and got them to really hammer on me about writing a comic. And right from the beginning, that comic was always going to be a sequel to Fight Club. At the time, my current book contract with Doubleday was for a collection of short stories that were for the most part already written, so I did have this big window of time that I could work on the learning curve for comics. And then [Dark Horse comics editor-in-chief] Scott Allie was also a friend of Chelsea’s, and Scott asked for an introduction, and that’s how I got hooked up with Dark Horse. And since they were local, they really told me a whole new storytelling skill. What was it like writing for a new medium, and learning how comics and graphic novels work? It was great to be the kind of stupid person in the room, because usually I’m the person that everyone looks to, that expects to take the lead and declare what comes next. And it was nice to be kind of subjugated to the expertise of all these other people, and to be able to learn from them. And make mistakes that they wouldn’t make, and reinvent comics in my own different, weird way. Were there different aspects of the medium that presented particular challenges for you? Well I wanted to mimic certain tricks that David Fincher did in the film, where he acknowledged the medium — by making it appear the film was rattling in the cage of the projector, and pointing out changeover dots, and burning the film and splicing the film and breaking the fourth wall. So right from the beginning I wanted to see some photorealistic things that would appear on the page, like rose petals and pills, that would obscure — or occlude — people’s faces; their expression. And also captions and dialogue, that kind of implied the inauthenticity of what was being said. To cut the importance of the written word on the page. And so that became one of the real-world tricks I wanted to do that were kind of a nod to David. It has to be fun to have that expanded toolset to play with. When those things start happening in the first issue, there’s an immediate tension. It draws you in. There have been studies that show occluded things, or incomplete forms, are much more engaging, and that’s what led to so many fashion magazines no longer having heads. It’s that we will look at the headless thing, trying to complete it in our minds for much longer than we’ll look at the complete thing with a full face. And it’s another thing I liked about [Fight Club 2 artist] Cameron Stewart’s style, is that he will depict just a mouth or just eyes with dialogue. And we’re much more drawn to that incomplete thing than we are to the respite of a full face or a full figure. Talking about real-life elements, there are two panels in the first issue where someone calls a character that looks an awfully lot like you. Is that person going to be showing up in future issues? Yeeeeeeah, that’s our meta thing. [Laughs.] Around issue four and issue five, I’m going to step in as a last resort character that Marla comes to in her search. So she’s actually going to show up in our writer’s group, in which Chelsea Cain is a member. So Chelsea will become a minor character, as will I and the rest of the writers. What was the idea behind that? Is there are a larger mythology here that you’re building, beyond what the original book and movie did? We live in a world where the creator becomes as much a character as the creation. People have this mythology around Matt Fraction or Brian Bendis. Or Kelly Sue [DeConnick], Matt’s wife. And it seems like acknowledging the creator would be another one of those breaking the fourth wall things that makes the narrative seem a little bit more true, because on some level you’re acknowledging that it’s fiction. And once I saw how Cameron was going to draw us, how flatteringly… Ah, the writer’s group! The original Fight Club resonated by satirizing certain aspects of consumer and media culture in a way that felt very fresh at the time — but since then, a lot of other works have tried to do that same thing. When you talk to readers that discover the book today, is it that same anti-consumer culture message speaking to them, or is it something else? Hmmm…. There still seems to be this desperate need to be tested, and to discover a person’s full potential. And one thing I’m writing about more overtly in the sequel is Joseph Campbell had a theory that every child needs a secondary father. That there’s a birth father that can love the child, and support the child, but after a certain age — usually in adolescence or young adulthood — there needs to be a secondary father. A mentor, a teacher, a reverend, a minister, a drill sergeant, a sports coach. Someone who isn’t as nurturing, but calls the child to perform greater and greater accomplishments that expand the child’s idea of their own potential. They basically send the child on quests, and they’re not precluded from the child getting hurt in minor ways in order to gain a greater confidence and ability. Which is something the birth father can’t really do; the birth father is just too invested in the child’s safety and well-being. But the problem is that so many of these secondary fathers have fallen out of the culture right now. Religious leaders are seen as pariahs, and teachers, to a large extent, are seen as would-be sex offenders — as are coaches, and the military, and so many of these forms in which the secondary father would arrive are disappearing. So we see more and more kids going into gangs, which have always acted as a secondary father for certain groups. It usually groups the Irish, the Italians; there was even a Jewish mafia, so there was always an organized crime and gang world that acted as the secondary father. And that’s what I’m seeing more of now, just because the conventional secondary fathers are disappearing. I’m not nearly as verbose about it in the comic, but it is a point. And it’s something I hear from a lot of people. With regard to filling that void, after Fight Club came out people started up real fight clubs, which seemed to be focusing predominantly on the physicality of it rather than the thought and intellect behind it. Is that something that bothers you or gets in the way of your writing process, or are you able to just put that aside and focus on your work? You know, on one level I’m glad they did the fight clubs, because it’s a step. It’s a kind of first step to personal discovery, and whether it’s that kind of consensual fight, or whether it is weightlifting, as long as it is some way of discovering their own physical capacity. And it’s an action; it’s not someone sitting and thinking. So I fully support that. Hmmm. Beyond that, my work — my dream, or idea was that Project Mayhem and the whole organization would work to create empowered individuals who would go off to create their own visions. And that the organization itself would disappear. People weren’t meant to stay in it; the organization wasn’t meant to sustain its own power. Which was my experience with doing [Werner H. Erhard’s self-improvement training] EST. A lot of people who had a vision, who were empowered by EST — including myself — then went off to become the person they dreamed of being. That’s how I started writing. But a lot of people who didn’t really have a vision became part of EST. They really couldn’t bridge out of it. They just kind of perpetuated the power of the organization, because they didn’t have their own personal vision. And so what we’re seeing in Fight Club 2 is that Project Mayhem has crossed the line where it’s no longer about empowering people. It’s about maintaining its own power in the world. When you first started publishing, there was comparatively little online activity out there, and books could percolate by word of mouth over time. Today things can be spread and dissected so rapidly by online culture there’s a very different vibe to how things spread. What’s your take on that evolution, and do you think it impacts writers coming up today? It’s one reason why comics were so appealing. [Laughs.] The comics would have to come out over months and months, this very gradual discovery process, and I like that a lot. On the other hand, I feel a little… pity, for starting-out writing and creative people, because I perceive it as harder and harder to get the isolation that you need to really create your vision. I remember friends used to be appalled that I would unplug my telephone while I wrote, and I would spend a whole day with the phone unplugged. They thought that was the most antisocial, misanthropic thing you could do. And these days people automatically have to respond to every text and every call. How do you develop the concentration, and a vision, and a narrative in your head if you’re so constantly pulled away by the outside world? The fact that there are apps designed to shut out everything but the window that you’re writing in seems indicative of a much larger problem. I can totally understand that. I know writers who have one computer for the social stuff they have to do and one computer that is just their writing computer, that has no connectivity. Speaking of that, what is your writing process like these days? My process is still very journalistic. The freshest, most incredible stuff is always the stuff that people tell you in person. So someone will tell me an anecdote, and if I find it really compelling and heartbreaking and funny, I will repeat it at a party. And because of the competitive nature of human beings, everyone hearing that anecdote will have to offer a similar anecdote trying to top it. And by doing so, I can present a theme and allow dozens or hundreds of people in different social settings to develop that theme from their own experience. And in doing so, I turn one anecdote into a very large thing that is quilted with details from a lot of people’s lives — but still along the same theme. It’s a very Studs Terkel kind of work, but it keeps me from, you know, from stealing ideas off the internet. Which are in a way already published and out there. And it gives me access to the very freshest things that nobody’s acknowledging. I hate to throw this last question at you because I’m sure you get it in every interview, but — you’ve got the graphic novel coming, the book of short stories, possibly the musical — Are there other Fight Club stories you want tell? Is there another novel in the works? When I go on tour tomorrow I’ll be taking a rough screenplay for the Lullaby movie that I’ve agreed to look through and make notes on. So Lullaby is supposed to start production in a year, and we just finalized the agreement with James Franco for the Rant film, and so my dream is that it gets made, and turns out well enough that I can do the Rant sequel as a graphic novel. Just like repeating that pattern. And beyond that, I just don’t know.",0.6398257818341385,0.3601742181658615,0.16593014547997764,2359,4.6405256464603646,939,6.1895633652822148,1,12,"Culture, Entertainment, Comics, Film, Interview",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It's basically The Avengers but set in an alternate-universe Victorian England populated by the heroes and villains of literary fiction.

She shouldn't take the gig. No woman should. This season of The Bachelorette is determined to destroy the series. After a tasteless two-night season premiere that, for the first time, let a group of men choose between two women who would be this year's Bachelorette, viewers were shown a ""this season on"" preview montage. Usually, this is where ABC parades the most extravagant dates, majestic sunsets, juicy smooches, and a handful of dramatic showdowns between the men trying to court the woman of their shared dreams. This season is determined to destroy the series The first half of the preview delivered as expected, but the second half boiled the entire season's drama to a single arc: Kaitlyn has sex with someone, and she feels awful about it — probably because a gaggle of television producers are demanding she atone on network television. For a show that hinges on one person dating 20 suitors, it takes an awfully conservative stance on sex. But The Bachelorette airs on ABC, which is owned by parent company Disney, so if its view of sex is repressive, hypocritical, and laden with double standards, it probably shouldn't come as any surprise. If you haven't watched The Bachelorette or The Bachelor before, allow me to explain the series' complex sex protocol. For a show about dating 20 men, it takes a conservative stance on sex Both programs used to have unspoken rules that the stars not sleep with anyone until they've narrowed down the roster of possible mates to a final three. At that point they can have sex with the trio — separately, of course, and without the presence of a camera crew — in the show's Fantasy Suite. That rule has been flouted in recent years by the male leads of The Bachelor. While not explicitly stated, we're led to believe both Bachelor Ben and Bachelor Juan Pablo (again, separately) had sex in the ocean midway through their respective seasons, and Bachelor Chris had a number of sexual encounters, if not full-blown intercourse. In both scenarios, ABC or the producers or both walked the line, hinting at tawdry drama, but never confirming it, all the while preserving the sanctity of the Fantasy Suite. So in some capacity, past seasons of the show have been leading to this. Perhaps ABC sees the public shaming of a lead having sex before the Fantasy Suite as a course correction, recommitting to its make-believe rules of courtship. But the producers' target and method is all wrong, as it has been from this season's conception.   After last season's The Bachelor went full tilt, abandoning its reliable structure for one extended madcap makeout fest, the program's producers and ABC devised a follow-up that upped the ante: this season of The Bachelorette would star two women from last season's Bachelor, and the two dozen or so male suitors would be given the opportunity to decide which woman stays. Yes, the one progressive thing about an otherwise trashy show — a woman taking charge, choosing between men groveling for her attention — was immediately inverted to give power back to the men. And though Bachelorette Kaitlyn now decides who stays each week, she must deal with half of a suitor base that is either disinterested or expects her to justify why they should stay and compete for her affection and not leave the show for the woman they voted for — one guy actually does this! The season is tone-deaf In short, we've been promised a tone-deaf season of Kaitlyn being further humiliated, shamed, and robbed of any power. (A season that is at least partially the handiwork of a producer who spent a flight Tweeting about an uppity woman it turned out never existed.) Which brings us to the one flawless decision of the season: inviting comedian Amy Schumer to appear on Monday night's episode and deliver some blunt criticisms of The Bachelorette's least likable suitor. Schumer is one of the funniest comics alive and one of the fiercest patriarchy critics. The Bachelorette is a fitting target, not because it stars a naive woman seeking love on television, but because in its current warped manifestation, it has nothing to do with that woman or love. On her show Inside Amy Schumer, Schumer often plays a ditzy lead, and initially the joke seems to be on her and women like her. But after disarming the viewer, she shreds the real target: the dudes. Like The Bachelorette, it's a show starring a woman, but it's really about scummy, conniving, and judgmental men.  This is fertile ground for Amy Schumer. To quote my friend and editor Emily Yoshida, Schumer's comedy is often about women doing whatever they can to survive in their hellish manscape. And if there's a more heavily concentrated sampling of bloated testosterone than Bachelor Mansion, I can't think of it. Following Monday night's episode, the two worlds collided even further: Robert Mills, ABC's senior vice president of alternative series, specials, and late-night programming, tweeted at Schumer, offering her the role as the next Bachelorette.   OK here is the official offer to @amyschumer to become #TheBachelorette. Just say yes and we start tomorrow. #DraftAmy    It's the outside-looking-in perspective that allowed Schumer to shine a light on the series' darkest features. There's a difference between Schumer guesting on the show and appearing within it, which makes the offer so strange. ABC already has someone like Schumer as its current Bachelorette, and Schumer herself says Kaitlyn is her favorite contestant. On last season of The Bachelor, she was funny, confident, and sex positive. She introduces herself to Bachelor Chris with a grin, saying, ""You can plow my field any day."" Bachelor Chris, you see, is a farmer. ABC already has a contestant like Schumer Kaitlyn's spark is already fading with each hour of The Bachelorette. This personality lobotomy happens with each season of The Bachelorette, but it's especially painful to watch someone so charismatic and independent be gutted. ABC and its reps may claim they want someone like Amy Schumer to be the star of their show, but what they really want is a puppet. The show is beneath Amy Schumer; it's beneath all women. Where previous seasons at least flirted with the notion of empowerment, presenting a woman with the same ""human buffet"" that men receive on The Bachelor, the show is now about giving a woman the illusion of power, then reprimanding her when she doesn't act in line. ABC and the producers have been compared to pimps before, and it feels especially true now, as we watch the men tell a woman when and where she can have sex, and punish her when she disobeys.

ZTE is one of the many Chinese smartphone companies that doesn't yet have a great brand presence in the US, and the Axon is specifically designed to give the brand more equity here.

It is also equipped with a dual rear camera that allows for refocusing after a picture is taken (much like HTC's DuoCamera on the One M8), as well as what ZTE is calling ""hi-fi audio."" The Axon is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor with 4GB of RAM and has a 3,000mAh battery. It works on both AT&T and T-Mobile's LTE networks and runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. A two-year warranty differentiates the Axon from other phones The company is also introducing a new level of support for the Axon, starting with a two-year manufacturer warranty. ZTE says it's committed to bringing the latest Android updates to the Axon line, as well, appealing to the enthusiast smartphone users that have typically preferred Nexus phones for their fast software updates. The Axon is a departure from the phones ZTE has typically offered in the US, which were low-cost, low-end phones made by carriers. It considers its Nubia brand, which also offers high-end devices, a separate company, and will continue to sell phones such as Nubia Z9 direct to consumers worldwide. But the Axon was made for the US, and it doesn't have oddities such as dual SIM slots or Asian-influenced software interfaces, like many other Chinese smartphones in the US have. ZTE says it will still sell devices through carriers, and it will apply successful features from the Axon line to its carrier devices. ZTE is one of many companies trying the unlocked approach in the US ZTE isn't the only company trying to sell unlocked phones direct to consumers: this year, we've seen companies such as Alcatel OneTouch, Asus, and Huawei enter this market. All of the companies are trying to do the same thing: grab the attention of customers that want well-made, high-performing devices but aren't interested in paying upwards of $700 for an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. ZTE says it is forgoing a high marketing budget in order to put its resources in making the Axon a better device at a lower price, but it's not clear how well it will do in actually making a name for itself in the highly competitive US market.

But for pollinating insects that travel at high speeds, being able to react quickly to odor molecules is crucial. A moth’s sense of smell, for instance, is comparable to that of a dog — which means it vastly outperforms humans. But as our own innovation continues to introduce novel scents into the atmosphere, some scientists have started to wonder how our machines, and their pollutants, are affecting these insects’ abilities to located nectar-rich flowers. Now, a new study, published today in Science, demonstrates that fumes from cars not only compete with flowers, but also alter the way moths decode a flower’s scent. And this effect may be powerful enough to prevent these insects from finding — and therefore pollinating — agriculturally important flowers. The act of detecting and following an odor is extremely complex. Something as banal as turbulent air flow can quickly disperse odor molecules, which dilutes and mixes odors. So, when moths are flying quickly, they need to be able to pick up and recognize pertinent odor patches quickly. odor competition ""When the moth encounters an odor patch, it will move upwind closer to the odor source,"" says Jeff Riffell, a neuroecologist at the University of Washington and a co-author of the study. ""But this behavior is dependent upon the moth encountering the patches of odor at a sufficient enough rate for the moth to continue moving upwind closer and closer to the flower."" This rate specificity is useful, because it allows pollinators to detect and discriminate relevant, airborne signals at very small concentrations. Unfortunately, this characteristic also means that competing odors interfere with moths' ability to detect flowers. In the study, Riffell and his team put Manduca sexta moths in a large wind tunnel that also contained a computer-controlled odor-stimulus system. ""That allowed us to control the odor environment that the moths experience,"" he says. They tested how the moths responded to the smell of a flower called Datura wrightii at frequencies ranging from 1 to 20 Hz, and found that the moths responded most strongly to odor pulses at 1 Hz. Anything above 2 Hz was too fast, and caused the moths to act as though no odors were present. Then, the scientists introduced background odors into the tunnel while also emitting a flower-plume at 1 Hz. they used two common vehicle exhaust pollutants These background odors included two common vehicle-exhaust pollutants, xylene and toluene, at concentrations ranging from extremely high and unrealistic to those that would occur in suburban and urban neighborhoods. They also tested the moths to see how they fared against the odors emitted by non-flowering vegetation. As expected, these odor backgrounds — the pollutants, as well as certain plant volatiles — prevented the moths from detecting the flower’s scent. But the researchers didn’t just test this behaviorally. They also recorded the insects’ brain activity by inserting an electrode into the area of the brain that processes odors. This allowed them to demonstrate that the background odors were actually altering the neural perception of the flower by decreasing neurons’ ability to encode pulses of odor. This means that flowers aren't just competing with other plants, but also with the gas-guzzlers that we use around them. ""Environmental volatiles, both natural and human-made, activate the same receptors that are activated by flower scents,"" Riffell explains. When these receptors encounter strong odors that compete with flowers, they can become adapted — meaning they get used to the plethora of odors surrounding them, and stop being able to pick them apart. In other cases, however, these odors also affect the neurons that are responsible for processing flower scents. ""Both of these neuronal processes,"" he says, ""serve to ‘mask’ the flower scent."" background odors altered the moths' neural perception of the flower ""What this study suggests is potentially alarming for pollination and agriculture in general, when we consider that their study species is perhaps one of the most well-known model organisms for insects,"" said Alex Smith, a biologist at the University of Guelph in Ontario, in an email to The Verge. ""What if the vast majority of species involved in pollination — about which we often know much less — are also affected in the same manner?"" he asked. The study also calls attention to the human-induced fracturing of a critical ecological service, Smith said. ""It will be further alarming if that fracture extends into the other species of pollinators."" ""alarming for pollination and agriculture."" Sylvia Anton, a neurobiologist at the University of Angers in France, agrees. ""We should be concerned about volatiles emitted by anthropogenic actions,"" she wrote in an email, ""which might modify insect behavior in general, including pollinators, but also that of pest insects."" Riffell and his team would now like to replicate the experiments in an outside environment, with other species of pollinators. But for now, ""the takeaway message is that environmental chemicals like pollutants, and even chemicals from neighboring vegetation, can affect the pollinator's ability to find flowers,"" Riffell says. And ""because pollination is important for food security,"" these results have implications for native bumblebees, butterflies, and moths — not to mention ""agriculturally important pollinators, like honeybees.""",0.7702661226975063,0.22973387730249373,0.8237887905648126,876,5.4006849315068495,450,6.8266666666666671,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A lack of trust in nuclear technology, coupled with the global economic downturn that began in 2008, has resulted in a slowdown of construction and a plateau of the world's nuclear energy capacity.   According to the ""2DS"" scenario presented by the International Energy Agency, the world must halve its energy- and process-related CO2 emissions from 2011 levels in order to ensure an 80 percent chance of limiting the global average temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.) In order to achieve that aim, 186 gigawatts of nuclear capacity must be added between now and 2025. At current rates of nuclear plant construction, the Earth's nuclear energy output will fall between 5 and 24 percent short of that target.   Worldwide attitudes toward nuclear power are mixed three years after the Fukushima disaster. Japan and Germany reacted quickly against the technology, shutting down their reactors and prompting public debates about nuclear energy's safety, while China and Russia pressing ahead, planning ambitious nuclear power plant construction projects. 72 nuclear power plants were under construction at the end of 2013, but such facilities usually take between five and ten years to get up and running, and need to be retired after 30 to 40 years of operation. Capacity is sometimes replaced rather than increased. The United States retired four reactors in 2013, with another slated to be taken offline this fall — the country only has five in construction. The IEA says 186 gigwatts of nuclear capacity must be added by 2025 Even with these projects underway, the IEA is projecting a shortfall in nuclear power. Fukushima shows the energy generation method can be dangerous, but the IEA warns that if nuclear capacity, which it says provides 18 percent of the world's energy mix, isn't increased, a spike in global temperatures could be even more damaging.",0.2942104350054251,0.7057895649945749,0.8803213783676691,344,5.1540697674418601,210,5.8047619047619046,0,0,"Science, US & World",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Although it is still classified by the federal government as an illegal drug without medicinal value, a total of 23 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes as of June 2014. Doctors in these areas prescribe marijuana for a wide range of illnesses and health conditions, from glaucoma to rheumatoid arthritis to anxiety and epilepsy. But they're doing so without sound medical evidence that marijuana is effective for many ailments — at least according to The New York Times.  Federal funding for medical marijuana has been mostly nonexistent  The Times takes a look at the paucity of research on medical marijuana's health effects, interviewing doctors and advocates across the country who agree that there should be more studies done on the drug. However, the Times only glancingly mentions a major reason why there isn't more scientific basis for medical marijuana at present: the prohibitive legal climate in the United States. Up until recently, American doctors wishing to study marijuana could only count on one major legal supplier, itself encumbered by red tape. Federal funding for medical marijuana has been mostly nonexistent over the past 50 years due to marijuana's classification as a Schedule One drug in the Untied States, the strictest classification that also includes heroin and LSD, which most health experts and law enforcement officials consider to be far more dangerous drugs to individuals and society writ-large. And as the Times itself previously reported, the federal government actively discouraged doctors from studying medical marijuana. Still, hundreds of studies on the medical efficacy of cannabis have been conducted throughout the world over the years. In fact, the US Institute of Medicine, a nonprofit organization that is partially funded by and makes recommendations to the US government, reviewed many of the available studies and concluded that the active ingredient in marijuana, Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is beneficial for patients suffering a diversity of symptoms. As it wrote in a 1999 report: ""Scientific data indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid drugs, primarily THC, for pain relief, control of nausea and vomiting, and appetite stimulation,"" later adding ""The psychological effects of cannabinoids, such as anxiety reduction, sedation, and euphoria can influence their potential therapeutic value."" ""Scientific data indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid drugs."" The report goes on to note that smoking marijuana — the traditional method of ingestion for recreational users — may not be the best way to go about deriving its medical benefits: ""smoked marijuana, however, is a crude THC delivery system that also delivers harmful substances."" That interpretation, which comes from some of the nation's most trusted physicians, would seem to back the rationale behind the New York state legislature's recent decision to legalize marijuana for medical use in non-smokable forms (oil and edibles). At the national level, the legal restrictions preventing more medical marijuana research may close to changing as well: the US Food and Drug Administration is reportedly analyzing a request from the Drug Enforcement Agency to downgrade marijuana's classification to a more permissive one.",0.5241317533058744,0.47586824669412564,0.8431374186482485,542,5.5516605166051658,314,6.6337579617834397,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But with this new, more sensitive procedure, individuals who test positive for HIV will finally become aware of their status at a time when they are most likely to pass it on. ""Today, CDC is recommending a new approach for HIV testing in laboratories that capitalizes on the latest technology to improve diagnosis"" during the ""earliest stage of HIV infection,"" said Jonathan Mermin, director of the CDC's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, in a statement. ""With consistent and widespread use of this new testing method, we can diagnose people several weeks earlier than before."" ""we can diagnose people several weeks earlier than before."" The new method consists of a series of three tests, reports Medscape. If the result of the first test — a fourth generation HIV test that detects the HIV p-24 antigen — is negative, no further tests are required. But if the test is positive, than the CDC recommends a second test, which can differentiate between HIV-1 antibodies and HIV-2 antibodies. Being able to tell the difference between the two can have ""important treatment implications,"" the CDC said. If the results of the second test are negative, however, a third and final test will be necessary to ensure ""accurate detection of early infection"" or to indicate ""a false positive from the fourth generation test,"" the CDC explained. ""Nearly 1 in 6 people living with HIV in the United States do not know they have HIV, meaning that they are missing out on essential care and may unknowingly transmit the virus,"" Mermin said. And about half of the estimated 50,000 new HIV infections that happen each year are transmitted by people who don’t know their HIV status. So, the CDC is urging laboratories to adopt the new approach as quickly as possible.

""Genetically, Macroscelides micus is very different from other members of the genus and it's exciting to think that there are still areas of the world where even the mammal fauna is unknown and waiting to be explored,"" said Jack Dumbacher, a biologist and one of the authors of the study published yesterday in the Journal Of Mammalogy, in a statement. it's not a rodent Because of its size and shape, this rust-colored creature resembles a rat.

Dan Granett wants to build one for real, as Gizmodo originally reported. Granett, a former technician at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has sketched out plans for a machine he calls the Bugjuggler, for which he's currently soliciting corporate funding. The cutesy name hardly conveys the pure, ambitious madness of the project. If constructed, it will rise 70 feet tall on two fixed legs. It will have two giant moving arms, each capable of throwing up an 1,800-pound Volkswagen Beetle (the ""Bug"" in Bugjuggler) and catching it. It will be controlled by a person wearing computerized gloves that simulate what the robot is holding in real time. Oh, and Granett wants the robot to do all this in front of a live audience. ""Of course there will be a safety radius around the operation,"" he tells The Verge. ""A drop in the bucket."" For now, the Bugjuggler is just an idea. But Granett and his two collaborators on Bugjuggler, an animator and a web designer, are hoping that one or more wealthy companies or individuals will decide to fund the project to its estimated budget of $2.3 million. ""A drop in the bucket,"" Granett says of the amount they're asking for, at least compared to other online funding goals. Granett and his colleagues will even teach anyone who helps fund the project how to control the robot. Whoever pilots it will do so from a karaoke-like setup a safe distance away from the bot, or, for the more daring, straight from a cockpit mounted in the machine's head (the robot would have modes for either method of control).     To that end, this week he and his collaborators launched a kind of highly-targeted crowfunding site that gives an overview of exactly how the Bugjuggler robot will work and includes conceptual animations of it juggling cars in midair. Ideal use cases would be at a monster truck rally or stadium sporting event (the cars would have to be junkers, as they will certainly be totaled by the robot's crushing grip). Somewhere lots of people could gather and view the spectacle of a humanoid machine jugging cars without fear of their life and limb. As the site outlines, Granett is confident that the robot can be constructed within eight months to a year using readily available technology, namely, a series of hydraulics, servos, a diesel engine, a giant steel frame and haptic feedback gloves for the human operator. ""All of that is already pretty established in the tech industry,"" Granett says of the basic components. He's even building an 8-foot tall prototype in his lab in Berkeley to prove it can be done. As for who Granett thinks may be interested in fronting the cash for all this, Red Bull, Elon Musk, and Richard Branson are all names he mentions as ideal candidates. Granett says he would even alter his design to win Musk's approval. ""In his case, I would use an electric motor with batteries instead of a diesel engine [to power the robot],"" Granett explains, citing Musk's electric car company, Tesla Motors. ""Then you could have an electrically-powered robot tossing around [cars with] internal combustion engines, anticipating their demise.""  ""A lot of CEOs juggle things."" To understand why the 69-year-old Granett decided that he should dedicate his considerable mechanical engineering expertise (after he left NASA in the 1980s, he built dozens of machines for heavy industry and for Hollywood at his lab in Berkeley), you have to understand his true passion project. Granett also runs a nonprofit called Street Physics, the aim of which is to build devices that help conserve energy and better the lives of people in the developing world. One of the nonprofit's chief innovations is a bladed turbine that could be used as a portable generator and runs on biowaste —  rice husks, cow dung, crop stalks are some examples of potential fuels.

""Is it thick enough to stop a bullet?"" When Elonis started posting what he claimed were ""rap lyrics"" on Facebook, the people who knew him didn’t take the posts to be mere homages to Eminem. They — his coworkers, his boss, his soon-to-be ex-wife — saw something sinister in his words, something dangerous enough that law enforcement ought to get involved. After the FBI showed up to question Elonis at home, he responded by posting this: You know your shit’s ridiculous when you have the FBI knockin’ at yo door Little Agent Lady stood so close Took all the strength I had not to turn the bitch ghost Pull my knife, flick my wrist, and slit her throat  Leave her bleedin’ from her jugular in the arms of her partner [laughter] So the next time you knock, you best be serving a warrant And bring yo’ SWAT and an explosives expert while you’re at it Cause little did y’all know, I was strapped wit’ a bomb Why do you think it took me so long to get dressed with no shoes on? Elonis was convicted ""of transmitting in interstate commerce a ‘threat to injure the person of another.’"" He appealed, claiming that prosecutors should have shown that he had intended to threaten. After losing at the Court of Appeals, he again appealed to the Supreme Court. On June 1st, the Supreme Court sided with Elonis — meaning he may be entitled to a new trial. What Elonis wants — and what he’ll get, now that the Supreme Court has ruled in his favor— is a ""heightened mental state requirement"" in the law, meaning that prosecutors can’t just show that ""a reasonable person would have known"" that the communications were threatening. Instead, they have to show a subjective mental state on Elonis’ part. It doesn’t mean they have to read his mind, or his diary, or elicit a confession from him. A subjective state of mind can be inferred from the words themselves, from the context, from a person’s outwardly perceived behavior. It doesn’t mean they have to read his mind In theory, a ""heightened mental state requirement"" means an additional burden on prosecutors, meaning it’s harder to go after people like Elonis. But in practice, it’s not even obvious that prosecutors had to bring any additional evidence to Elonis’ trial. If they had just slightly tweaked the wording of the jury instruction, the entire trial and subsequent conviction could have played out exactly the same way, and Elonis wouldn’t have been able to appeal it, either. ""You can infer what a person's state of mind is from the circumstances of how and what was said in words, correct?"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Elonis’ attorney during oral arguments in December. ""So if that’s the case, isn't the jury acting like a reasonable person in looking at the words and the circumstances and saying, did he intend this or didn't he? I mean, I don't know what the difference between the standard given and the one [you want would be]."" Even though the Supreme Court sided with Elonis, it’s not ""good news for abusive trolls,"" as some outlets have phrased it. Elonis could have been a landmark First Amendment case if it had revisited the definition of a ""true threat,"" a legal concept that is in dire need of elaboration, but what ended up happening is that the court didn’t really do much of anything at all. Elonis stands for the proposition that the government can’t convict someone of a crime under 18 USC §875(c) using just a ""negligence standard,"" also known as an objective or ""reasonable person"" standard. The official answer is: ""Who knows?"" This isn’t interesting or new. In general, negligence isn’t enough to uphold any kind of criminal conviction. ""This is the standard with virtually every other crime,"" Lee Rowland, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, said to The Verge back in November. ""If you really think that there’s a fire in a theater, and you yell fire, you haven’t committed a crime, even if there’s no fire."" So the burning question on everyone’s mind was: if not negligence, what standard is required to convict someone under 18 USC §875(c) — or more importantly, what’s the standard for true threats in general? Do you have to purposefully intend a threat to be threatening? Is it enough to just know it will be threatening? Or can you be convicted simply for recklessly disregarding the risk that it will be threatening to the recipient? As of this decision, the official answer is: ""Who knows?"" The majority opinion says that it’s definitely more than negligence, but explicitly declines to decide what the actual standard is, choosing instead to wait for more cases to filter up through the appeals courts. If not negligence, what standard is required to convict someone? In a separate opinion, Justice Samuel Alito blasted the court for refusing to elaborate which standard, saying their indecision was ""certain to cause confusion and serious problems."" For Alito, the answer is obvious — they should have settled on the recklessness standard, just one step above negligence. Alito’s part-concurrence, part-dissent takes special care to emphasize the justice’s own personal disgust for Elonis. The subtext of his opinion is incredulity and outrage that anyone could take Elonis at his word, that the man could possibly get away with any of it — an unusually emotional reaction from someone who regularly upholds death sentences for a living. ""There was evidence that Elonis made sure his wife saw his posts. And she testified that they made her feel ‘extremely afraid’ and ‘like [she] was being stalked.’ Considering the context, who could blame her? Threats of violence and intimidation are among the most favored weapons of domestic abusers, and the rise of social media has only made those tactics more commonplace,"" wrote Alito, suddenly a women’s rights activist.  ""A fig leaf of artistic expression cannot convert such hurtful, valueless threats into protected speech."" ""A fig leaf of artistic expression cannot convert such hurtful, valueless threats into protected speech."" Elonis is a deeply unsympathetic character. Based on the facts of his case, it’s difficult to see why a heightened mental state requirement is important for prosecuting speech on the internet. But take, for example, the teenaged League of Legends player who ""threatened"" on Facebook to shoot up a kindergarten and was subsequently jailed. (The postings were supposedly followed by ""J/K"" and ""LOL."") The person who reported the post lived in Canada, had no relation to the teen, and was unfamiliar with how players regularly troll each other. A ""reasonable person"" standard, even a recklessness standard, could net many convictions for similar outbursts on the internet. Trolling isn’t exactly laudable, but in many cases, it doesn’t merit a prison sentence either. The problem with using Anthony Douglas Elonis as a test case is that it’s hard to believe anything that comes out of his mouth. He says it was all a joke, and some of his postings even link to the Wikipedia article for the First Amendment. But simply tacking ""just kidding"" onto a Facebook post doesn’t make it non-threatening, especially when graphic verses are interspersed with ASCII diagrams of his estranged wife’s new home and detailed descriptions of which side of the house he’s going to shoot her from.  Elonis was always a bad vehicle for a very good question What Alito and Thomas (the latter of whom wrote his own dissent, siding with prosecutors) fear is that the ""just kidding"" might be enough to exonerate Elonis, if juries are required to find some form of heightened criminal intent in Elonis. They don’t think it’s possible that 12 people could read the Facebook posts, hear the testimony of his boss, his wife, the FBI agent, and come to the conclusion that despite the ""just kidding,"" Elonis was still purposefully terrorizing his wife. Yet they themselves can look at the record and find his behavior troubling. ""Imagine the effect on Elonis’ estranged wife when she read this,"" Alito asks of his audience, when neither we nor he know Elonis’ wife. Elonis knew his wife better than any of us. Is it really so impossible to look at the words, hear the testimony, and come to the conclusion that he knew exactly what he was doing? The Elonis decision isn’t a free pass for domestic abusers or online harassers. And it’s far from the end of the story. The Supreme Court didn’t make its mind up this time, but as legislators and law enforcement take a greater interest in online threats, similar cases are bound to go up in the future. Perhaps the court’s indecision was for the best. Elonis was always a bad vehicle for a very good question. The cases to come might better demonstrate the benefits, trade-offs, and dangers that inhere in prosecuting online speech.",0.2635860431836921,0.736413956816308,0.521139119349663,1513,4.9596827495042959,719,6.2628650904033378,0,0,"Culture, Tech, Essay",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Charter has nominated 13 candidates to be elected to TWC's board, which Reuters reports will be up for election again at a shareholder meeting that will likely be held in May. If Charter can install its own supporters on the board, it would effectively force TWC to begin discussions about a potential buyout — a deal that it's rebuked so far.  ""We are not going to let Charter steal the company."" ""It is clear that Charter is nominating a slate of directors for the sole purpose of pressuring our board into accepting the same lowball offer that it previously considered and unanimously rejected,"" TWC CEO Rob Marcus says in a statement. TWC has shot down three Charter offers in the last seven months alone, all of which TWC has made clear were too low. ""We are confident in our strategic plan ... and we are not going to let Charter steal the company."" Since its third bid for TWC was rebuffed, Charter has begun appealing directly to its competitor's shareholders with the hopes of winning them over. By nominating a full slate of board candidates, Charter has given those shareholders an easy way to vote for or against the potential buyout. ""It is clear from our meetings with Time Warner Cable shareholders that there is an overwhelming desire to combine these two companies,"" Charter CEO Tom Rutledge says in a statement. ""Now is the time for the current board and management of Time Warner Cable to respond to their shareholders and work with us to complete a merger to the benefit of shareholders while minimizing their execution and market risks."" Even if Charter's board takeover is successful, it'll still have to convince the board that its deal is worth taking. Reuters previously reported that Charter is considering raising its buyout offer within the next few weeks, potentially into the low $140s per share, with $142.50 per share being one option discussed. That would be a large jump from Charter's most recent offer of a cash and stock mixture of just $132.50, though it would still fall far short of what TWC is looking for — between $150 to $160 per share. Charter has argued that news of its offer alone has built more value into TWC's stock and that a much higher offer shouldn't be necessary, though it's clear that TWC still isn't interested. As TWC puts it, its board ""unanimously rejected [the offer] as grossly inadequate."" Charter now has pressure on TWC until May, and The Wall Street Journal reports that it's expected to continue its attempts at private negotiations for a deal up until then. It's an uphill battle for Charter, but it thinks now is an important time to expand and is bluntly moving forward with attempts to do so in spite of the strong opposition.",0.5193315550816363,0.4806684449183637,0.18499131610150232,502,4.7808764940239046,272,5.6875,0,0,Business,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Almost immediately, people began trickling in from out of state just to experience the novelty of buying a sandwich with their digital coins. Andrew Torba and a friend drove 45 minutes. ""During the ride we spoke about the potential Bitcoin had to completely revolutionize global commerce and finance, which only heightened the anticipation to make our first purchase,"" he wrote in a blog post titled ""I Bought Subway with Bitcoin and It Was Awesome."" Shah started getting attention on Reddit, then from local media. Two weeks after he started accepting Bitcoin, he was on CNBC. His story has also been featured by Yahoo, The Washington Post, CNN, and Entrepreneur magazine. It’s the Bitcoin bump. ""We didn’t really expect this onslaught of publicity."" The virtual currency, which approximates cash on the internet, now powers an economy worth around $7 billion. Much of that value just comes from people buying and selling the currency itself, however; merchants that accept Bitcoin are still relatively rare. That means anyone who does gets a bit of extra attention from virtual currency fans — and the press. When real estate developer Jack Sommer decided to accept Bitcoin in addition to traditional currencies for his $7.85 million mansion in Las Vegas, he didn’t do much to spread the news: he added ""Bitcoin Accepted"" to his YouTube ad. The number of views doubled nearly overnight. Sommer and his wife Laura were astonished: their son had advised them that they would get ""more exposure"" for the property, but they had no idea it would bring on the news crews. They’ve had a couple inquiries about buying the house in Bitcoin, but more than that, the house has now been featured everywhere from local media all the way up to Fox News. ""We didn’t really expect this onslaught of publicity,"" Laura says.  An anonymous Bitcoin user drove two hours to get to Shah’s Subway. The YouTube video of the experience has more than 10,000 views. The first wave of Bitcoin acceptance was from people like Shah who are deeply embedded in the Bitcoin scene; the second wave was from people like the Sommers who were converted by a true believer. The third wave, however, is made up of opportunists. Shortly after The Verge covered the Sommer house, a real estate broker wrote in about a mansion for sale in Paris for $10 million. He had convinced his client to accept Bitcoin and was hoping for similar coverage. ""My listing surpasses the previous record listing of Mr. Sommer,"" he wrote. ""I’m sure that this is newsworthy to yourself, for the same reason Mr. Sommer's listing was."" The broker is not unique. There has been a deluge of ""firsts"" to Bitcoin acceptance: the first car dealership, first winery, first pro sports team. ""I was wondering if one of you would like to do a short piece on Sheridans’ acceptance of Bitcoin,"" a representative recently wrote to The Verge, noting that Sheridans is the first UK law firm to accept payment in Bitcoin. Some of this adoption is a bit disingenuous Some of this adoption is a bit disingenuous. The dealership, for example, made the customer convert his bitcoins into dollars before the sale. Merchant adoption is a good thing even if it’s just a marketing gimmick, according to advocates who hope to see Bitcoin become a universal currency. But what happens when accepting Bitcoin becomes common enough that it stops grabbing headlines? Will merchants continue to take it, given that it’s still a niche currency that is less convenient than cash? There are reasons to accept Bitcoin besides publicity. In the past, Bitcoin’s volatile price made it unappealing to merchants. Now that it is possible to immediately convert Bitcoin into other currencies, that downside has been made obsolete. The US government has also indicated that using Bitcoin for commerce is sanctioned, so the legal ambiguity is gone. Accepting Bitcoin also allows merchants to avoid expensive credit card fees and ""chargebacks,"" refunds merchants are forced to issue in the case of fraud. What happens when Bitcoin stops grabbing headlines? Overstock.com recently began accepting Bitcoin; it reportedly did $130,000 worth of sales in the currency in the first day. The company is now considering investing further in Bitcoin, possibly paying vendors and employees in the virtual currency. Online merchants have it much easier, as in-person Bitcoin transactions are still a bit unwieldy. While there are many Android apps that will do the job, iPhone owners face a challenge since Apple does not allow Bitcoin apps in the App Store. The technologically innovative Bitcoin developer community is hard at work overcoming these hurdles.

The update process will take only 40 minutes to complete, though it would surely have been much less painful if the company were able to deliver it over the air the way that Tesla does. While Toyota is keen to point out that its other hybrid vehicles aren't affected by the same flaw as the 2010 to 2014 Prius models, the company has also issued a US recall of RAV4, Tacoma, and Lexus RX 350 cars to rectify a separate problem with the skid control software.

Jobs replied: ""Those jobs aren't coming back."" At the time, it seemed like a reasonable assertion. US manufacturing was in the middle of a decades-long decline, and American companies seemed unable to compete with the low labor and production costs in China. But that may be changing, some say, thanks to an unlikely catalyst: robots. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google and Foxconn have been working together to develop new robotic manufacturing technologies. Experts say the partnership could have major implications for both the tech industry and the American economy, though the nature of those implications remains unclear — and an issue of intense debate. Some see automated manufacturing as a potential boon for the US economy, a way to lure companies back to American soil with the promise of higher productivity and lower labor costs. But others fear that the push could displace the last vestiges of middle-class American manufacturing workers at a time of high unemployment and soaring inequality. ""profound economic implications."" ""The pace and scale of this encroachment into human skills is relatively recent and has profound economic implications,"" MIT economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee wrote in their 2011 book Race Against the Machine. In the book, the authors argue that technology has destroyed more American jobs at a faster pace than it's created new ones, leading to higher unemployment and stagnant median incomes despite higher productivity levels. Although they conclude on an optimistic note, arguing that technological change will yield benefits in the long run, Brynjolfsson and McAfee say its short-term effects could be devastating for American workers. The decline of American manufacturing is impossible to ignore; according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy lost 6 million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2009 alone. But rising wages in China and increased transportation costs have spurred some companies to move manufacturing back to the US. Bolstering the country's robotics industry, some say, would give the US a competitive advantage, particularly in the manufacturing of valuable high-end products like electronics and cars. President Obama has repeatedly called for greater investment in high-end manufacturing, calling for a technological push ""not seen since the height of the Space Race."" Earlier this year, he announced the creation of six high-tech manufacturing hubs as part of an effort to spur domestic job growth. The White House has called for a $1 billion investment to launch 15 other technology hubs, though the plan remains contingent upon approval from Congress. Google's involvement could mark an inflection point in robotics Companies like Apple and Amazon have already invested heavily in automated manufacturing, but experts say Google's involvement could mark an inflection point in the robotics industry. Thus far, most manufacturing robots have been produced for very specialized purposes, and with little interoperability. Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, says that Google may do for robotics what it did for mobile software, creating a more interoperable platform that could be applied across various industries and at lower costs. Andy Rubin, the man behind Google's Android operating system, has now moved to head up Google's robotics efforts, and has reportedly been discussing new automated technologies with Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou. ""Look at what Google did for the phone,"" Atkinson says. ""They basically built a cheap and easy-to-use, easy-to-distribute operating system with Android. That's something that by and large has not been done in robotics."" Considering their recent robot-based initiatives, it's no surprise that Google and Foxconn would choose to collaborate. Google has spent the last several months acquiring various robotics companies, while Foxconn began deploying robots en masse at its factories in 2012. Last year, the Taiwan-based company announced plans to invest $40 million in a robot manufacturing facility in Pennsylvania, with Gou saying that Foxconn wants to be part of the manufacturing ""renaissance"" in the US. It's debatable as to whether this renaissance will actually come to fruition, though the costs of automated manufacturing are certainly coming down. A 2012 report from the McKinsey Group showed that the price of automated labor compared to human labor has fallen by up to 50 percent since 1990 — a trend that researchers expect to continue. Impacts on labor markets remain unclear Shifting manufacturing away from Asia won't be easy — especially for technology companies that rely on tightly integrated supply chains rooted in China — and the effects of automation on the American job market are still uncertain. Proponents of automated manufacturing acknowledge that some jobs may be swallowed by machines, but insist that the long-term benefits will far outweigh the losses. A robust manufacturing sector would increase productivity and fuel domestic demand, they argue, thereby creating new (albeit different) jobs for displaced workers and perhaps leveling out the US trade deficit. More domestically produced electronics and cars, for instance, would create demand for technicians and mechanics, jobs still best suited to humans. And although the extent to which robots take hold of manufacturing remains to be seen, Atkinson and others say it's indisputable that the sector is entering a transformative phase, and that the trade-offs involved will be far more complex than a matter of ""robots versus employment."" ""That's not really what our choice is,"" he argues. ""I think our choice is continued erosion of our manufacturing capabilities and the jobs that go with it, or a more revolutionary transformation.""",0.7274333785252879,0.2725666214747121,0.8664333384133638,940,5.5223404255319153,503,6.5387673956262429,0,0,"Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Within Facebook, it's known as the voter megaphone, and this year, the company is rolling it out to every US citizen over the age of 18. But while Get Out The Vote efforts are usually seen as apolitical, Facebook's program has drawn a surprising amount of controversy in the run-up to today's elections. It started on Friday, when Mother Jones ran an exclusive look into the technology behind the megaphone. The 2012 megaphone had been inconsistent, thanks to some software bugs, and didn't end up reaching everyone. At the same time, Facebook had been running another newsfeed experiment, giving news stories an algorithmic boost for certain users to see if it heightened civic engagement, as measured by a questionnaire. In both cases, the net effect should have been more voters across the board, but the combination has raised criticism about the potential political effects of Facebook's voter efforts. What if the push sent more Democrats than Republicans to the polls, shifting the balance of a swing election? What if that power ends up being leased out as part of Facebook's advertising goals? Are we entering the next era of socially networked campaigning? Platforms where with algorithms pick what is shown—Google, Facebook, Twitter trends—come with real power. Complex issues, little disclosure.  The same network effects that make Facebook valuable & important to many people, give it great power. Time to match power to responsibility.  ""The messages directly influenced...real-world voting behavior."" Facebook, for its part, has maintained that all it wants is to get people to the polls. ""Our effort is neutral,"" said a company spokesperson, ""while we encourage any and all candidates, groups, and voters to use our platform to engage on the elections, we as a company have not used our products in a way that attempts to influence how people vote."" The megaphone button has appeared in US elections since 2008, as well as national elections in India, Brazil and Indonesia, but thanks to the fix for a previously unpredictable algorithm, this is the first time the company is sure it's reaching everyone of voting age on the network. The news feed experiment is more sensitive. Facebook drew criticism this summer for altering user feeds as part of a psychology experiment, and ultimately implemented new research guidelines as a result of the controversy. The company says the 2012 experiment is consistent the new guidelines, and is set to be published later this year, but Facebook emphasized that it wasn't boosting any partisan messages, only general news content. Still, when researchers from UC San Diego conducted a similar study during the 2010 elections, they found a slight social nudge can have a big impact. After sending randomized messages over Facebook, ""the results show[ed] that the messages directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking and real-world voting behavior of millions of people."" In other words, Facebook is already a powerful political tool, however it ends up being used. That's not terribly surprising by itself — there are hundreds of political science studies about the importance of social connection in voting behavior — but it suggests the platform itself is emerging as a new political force. It's easy to imagine a time when Facebook outreach is as important to a campaign as town hall meetings or television ads. Would that be more democratic or less?

When a suspect in California was detained for driving drunk, she gave the arresting officer her phone's passcode code so he could look up a number. Now, a court case is revealing that the officer did much more than that. Officer Sean Harrington of the California Highway Patrol is being charged with stealing several nude photos from the phone once it was unlocked. Harrington stole photos in two separate incidents — in both cases, suspects voluntarily unlocked their phones — and because he simply emailed the photos to himself, there's a clear paper trail indicating when and how the photos were shared. And since there's clearly no valid law enforcement justification for it, Harrington is being charged with felony data theft, and has already resigned from the highway patrol. The case is a reminder of just how difficult it is to keep robust security measures in place, particularly when law enforcement is involved. The standard phone-locking mechanism offers a single layer of protection covering all the data in the device, which means it's impossible to access any data without unlocking all of it. The pictures in your camera roll might be more sensitive than the numbers in your phone book, but if you want to get at either of them, you have to unlock both. That's particularly important since police may decide to search a suspect's recent photos or calls looking for evidence of further crimes. Harrington's snooping was particularly egregious, but if there had been the slightest pretense of investigation, it's unlikely he would have been charged.

But as was the case back then, and long before photo-sharing apps even existed, taking photos of a completed ballot actually remains illegal in many parts of the US. Why? Because lawmakers over the years have sought to protect the sanctity and anonymity of the voting booth, as well as prevent tampering and undue influence on a person's vote (that is, people feeling pressured to vote a certain way outside their own independent conclusions — read more about the topic in this excellent guide from the Digital Media Law Project). So in many cases, people who post photos of their completed ballots online are technically at risk of getting steep fines and having their votes invalidated. But not if the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire gets its way. The non-profit citizen rights' organization recently sued the New Hampshire state government to overturn that state's ban on photographing and posting completed ballots, as Boston.com reports. New Hampshire recently updated its law to specifically outlaw digital photos of filled-out ballots, with fines up to $1,000 per violation. Already this year, at least three New Hampshire residents have reportedly been investigated by the attorney general for posting ballot photos on social media, including one former police officer who filled out his ballot with his dead dog's name. If the ACLU succeeds, it could finally legalize a common form of political participation and civic engagement.

As Reuters reports, Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced told Hungarian media today that the so-called internet tax will be withdrawn from the country's draft budget, and that a tax on money earned online will be revisited next year. ""This must be withdrawn, and we do not have to deal with this now.""   ""This tax in its current form cannot be introduced because the government wanted to extend a telecommunications tax, but the people see an internet tax,"" Orban told Radio Kossuth Friday. ""If the people not only dislike something but also consider it unreasonable then it should not be done... The tax code should be modified. This must be withdrawn, and we do not have to deal with this now."" The proposed tax would have seen internet service providers pay around $0.62 per gigabyte of transferred data. Officials estimated that the policy would bring in about $8 million in additional revenue, though others pegged the total as high as $720 million. Around 100,000 demonstrators took to the streets of Budapest on Tuesday to protest the plan as well as the broader policies of Orban's central-right government, which many see as increasingly authoritarian. Speaking to Hungarian radio, Orban said the government will discuss internet regulation and taxation again in January, with talks concluding by the middle of next year. ""There are two questions,"" Orban said. ""The question of internet regulation, what can and cannot be done, and the financial questions of the internet. We really should see somehow where the huge profits generated online go, and whether there is a way to keep some of it in Hungary and channel it into the budget."" Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission, welcomed Hungary's decision to move away from its internet tax, describing it as a victory for Europe.

On a call today, senior FCC officials announced that Chairman Tom Wheeler was circulating draft rules that would improve reliability, expand requirements for service providers, and make it clearer who is responsible when 911 fails. The emergency phone system is increasingly facing problems as wireline networks age and VoIP and wireless phone use increases. It's had frequent failures, including a major ""sunny day"" outage (in which no outside factors were responsible) in April 2014 that affected 11 million people. The FCC cites at least three other cases from this year: a 20-hour service outage across the state of Hawaii, a 40-minute outage for Vermont, and a wireless carrier outage that knocked 40 million customers' 911 access offline for two hours. The FCC wants a clear chain of responsibility for emergency calls Many problems stem from errors that route calls to the wrong place or stop them from being completed, combined with a lack of failsafes and miscommunication when multiple phone service providers all outsource their emergency infrastructure to one company. Moving from copper wires to newer technology has created new problems. Traditional landline phone service, for example, works during blackouts because the wires themselves are powered by phone companies. But VoIP service, run over newer network infrastructure, will go out unless customers have a backup battery on hand. Wheeler is proposing two calls for comment that will cover both general 911 regulations and plans for upgrading networks without losing basic functionality. Some parts of the proposal are meant to deal with network upgrades. The FCC wants to know whether companies should have to provide backup batteries when switching away from copper wire, and how carriers should deal with changing or shutting down a service. Among other things, companies will need to be more transparent with customers. Others are more broad, attempting to clear up confusion around emergency calls. One of the biggest issues with 911 service is that a few companies serve as choke points, routing calls from from thousands of miles away. It doesn't sound like this infrastructure will become less centralized, but the FCC is attempting to at least establish a chain of command, assigning primary authority and accountability to carriers (although that could change based on input.) It's also looking at how to expand the 911 certification process to deal with these new questions. 911 reform has been on the table for some time, and like other FCC proposals, this will need to go through a lengthy comment period before being adopted. But given the agency's dire-sounding report from earlier this month, it's clearly something it sees as a pressing concern.",0.36031466607808393,0.6396853339219161,0.8788470629577132,455,5.3032967032967031,282,6.2340425531914896,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Surreal Vision grew out of its three co-founders' Ph.D. research at Imperial College London; the team will now move to Oculus' lab in Redmond, Washington. This is the latest of several acquisitions by Oculus, which was itself purchased by Facebook in March of 2014. After the Facebook buyout, it brought on the design team that helped create the Xbox 360 controller and Kinect, followed by motion-tracking company Nimble VR. In a blog post today, Surreal Vision gave us an idea of what it will be doing (emphasis added.) From the human point of view, the world is constantly in motion. As we move around, our eyes dart about the scene and the rich dynamical nature of the scene's contents come flooding in. We're able to make sense of those changing signals to produce a coherent understanding of the world we live in, which we effortlessly navigate and interact with. Over the past three decades, a great deal of work in computer vision has attempted to mimic human-class perceptual capabilities using color and depth cameras. At Surreal Vision, we are overhauling state-of-the-art 3D scene reconstruction algorithms to provide a rich, up-to-date model of everything in the environment including people and their interactions with each other. We're developing breakthrough techniques to capture, interpret, manage, analyze, and finally re-project in real-time a model of reality back to the user in a way that feels real, creating a new, mixed reality that brings together the virtual and real worlds. Ultimately, these technologies will lead to VR and AR systems that can be used in any condition, day or night, indoors or outdoors. They will open the door to true telepresence, where people can visit anyone, anywhere. Much progress has been made toward this future, but significant challenges remain. For virtual reality, the accuracy and quality of the continuously updating 3D reconstruction must be near flawless, which is a requirement almost no other modern computer vision problem faces. When we cross these seminal thresholds, users will perceive the virtual world as truly real - and that is the experience we're driving toward. For an example of what that might look like, we can look to SLAM++, a virtual mapping system developed by Surreal Vision co-founders. In the demo video above, a depth-sensing camera scans a room, and a program analyzes its contents, matching it against a pre-rendered database of objects like chairs and tables. From there, digital creations can appear to interact with real-world ones. (Back in 2013, when the demo below was filmed, that meant having virtual human beings stand up from real chairs and dance to ""Gangnam Style."")  Being able to apply game physics to real space is central to augmented reality projects like Microsoft HoloLens, but so far, Oculus has limited real-world interactions in its own worlds. Now that it's got a finished product officially coming next year, though, it's promised to show us more ways to use VR. Whatever the team ends up working on at Oculus, one of the unique aspects of SLAM++ is that it doesn't just find the shape of a thing, it makes guesses at what it is. Augmented reality often involves adding bells and whistles to the real world. But something like Surreal Vision's work could be equally important for, as the team mentions, telepresence. It's how you could buy virtual tickets to an NBA game and sit convincingly on the bleachers, or sip from a coffee cup during a virtual meeting. And above all, it could dovetail with work on motion control — one of the central problems that VR and AR enthusiasts are still trying to crack.",0.7450752200546393,0.25492477994536067,0.5363927692254119,628,4.9968152866242042,382,6.0445026178010473,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

They've long been at the heart of the heady promises (or threats) we've heard about the Internet of Things: A subway can tell when the next train is coming! A retail store can alert you to a deal on those shoes you're trying on! You can finally get mapping to work in the basement of the mall! But for various reasons, they haven't spread as rapidly as their proponents have hoped. To date, the widest implementation of these beacons has been Apple's iBeacon tech, but now Google is entering the fray in a more serious way with an open standard it's calling Eddystone (after the lighthouse, you see). Eddystone isn't technically supposed to just be a Google project, though, as the company is open-sourcing many of the necessary specs and elements that make up a beacon ecosystem. Eddystone has a lot of moving parts Ars Technica spoke with the engineers behind the project at Google and have a good technical breakdown of the Eddystone platform. It differentiates itself from iBeacon by working with both Android and iOS, but it also seems to be more technically capable too: it can send URLs that can work with any app or just a web browser, for example, and make it easier for the company that's deploying them to manage their fleet of gadgets. Eddystone also allows for beacons that can change their unique identifiers, which might make them safer to put inside your suitcase. Beyond technical issues, there may be another reason that Bluetooth beacons haven't spread as widely as they might have: privacy concerns. It's possible that the apps that the beacons communicate with could call home with the location data stored in the beacon — so Macy's could figure out just how you're wandering in the store. Last year, BuzzFeed discovered that 500 beacons had been installed in New York City phone booths, which turned out to have been installed to send deals related to the Tribeca film festival, but nonetheless were a disconcerting discovery. Whether or not Eddystone will move any of those concerns in the right direction is obviously an open question, but it's worth noting again that Google intends this to be an open-source, wide-ranging ecosystem — not simply a way for Google to find another way to insert itself into your digital life. Instead of talking about ads, the company says it's planning on using beacons to send non-interruptive notifications to Google Now so that it can show relevant information based on your location, ""like showing you menu items when you’re inside a restaurant."" We won't know if Eddystone beacons can supplant iBeacons anytime soon, much less make Bluetooth beacons as common as Wi-Fi hotspots — but it's a good bet that they won't show up in an Apple store anytime soon.",0.49588182773190687,0.5041181722680932,0.20695285543109218,489,4.9038854805725975,280,5.7928571428571427,0,0,"Google, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Mars' years last 687 days, a total that Curiosity reached on June 24th after touching down on the world's ruddy surface in August 2012. To commemorate the Martian milestone, the Curiosity team at NASA released a new ""selfie"" of the rover on the planet's surface, and compiled a video recapping its most important findings and photos.  One of Curiosity's main aims was to work out if Mars was ever capable of supporting living organisms. It achieved that goal last March, when it sent back drilling samples from a dried-up river or lake bed that showed traces of sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon — all key chemicals for microbial life. Scientists already knew Mars had water, but he rover has also helped them understand how it once flowed. In September 2012, it analyzed gravel patterns and soil samples, working out that a stream near its landing point once flowed ankle- to hip-deep. The following year, data from the rover suggested humans could eventually mine water from Mars' surface. Curiosity has been a tremendous boon for scientists, but the four-wheeled robot has also provided us with a surprisingly human look at an alien world. In more than 600 days of operation, Curiosity has sent back tens of thousands of images, capturing lunar eclipses, huge mountains, the Earth itself in the Martian night sky, and in a bid to keep up with homeworld trends, its newest selfie. The robot has weathered freezing nights, memory problems, and government shutdowns, even successfully taking control of its own destiny as NASA engineers relinquished direct control of its actions.   The rover has traveled 4.9 miles since touching down on Mars. Wheel damage has slowed its movement in recent months, but it's still trundling along a revised course towards its destination of Mount Sharp, where it will search again for evidence of habitability.

Spreading detailed nuclear weapons knowledge goes against the principle of non-proliferation, and many countries would object to letting inspectors from a body like the United Nations dig around inside their war technology. As James Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace writes: But what if an inspector could verify that a weapon is a nuke without having to look inside? Let's say the inspectors want to verify that a weapon being destroyed is a genuine warhead and not a ""fake"" that has been substituted while the real one was stashed somewhere else. A group of researchers from Microsoft and Princeton University have developed a system for verifying that an item is a nuclear weapon without having to take it apart. It's what's known as a ""zero-knowledge proof"" — a mathematical concept in which a statement can be proven true without revealing how or why. The zero-knowledge proof for nuclear inspectors relies on firing neutrons at the warheads in order to produce an image. The inspector doesn't want to see an accurate image of the warhead, because that would reveal too much information. Instead, the inspectors' neutron detectors are preloaded with a negative of the image that would be produced by a real warhead. The inspector will get a null reading if the weapon is genuine. The supplied preloads are shuffled randomly by the inspector, so they'd better match the weapons or foul play will be obvious after a sufficient number of tests. Implementing such a system is a long way away, geopolitics-wise, but it's an intriguing solution.",0.5228044822116497,0.47719551778835034,0.8667913364522227,281,5.1387900355871885,186,6.0161290322580649,0,0,"Science, US & World",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In the 1960s and 1970s, scientists thought that smoking weed could trigger psychosis in just about anyone. Today, these findings are more nuanced, but researchers still think that cannabis can trigger schizophrenia in people who are predisposed to the disease — meaning those with family histories of the disorder. Yet, in the last decade, some scientists have actually started to look at the effect in reverse. The resulting studies suggest that the neurobiology underlying schizophrenia might also put people affected by the disorder at increased risk for smoking pot. But these results haven't garnered nearly as much attention as studies suggesting the opposite. part of the association might be caused by genetic overlap Now, a new study, published today in Molecular Psychiatry, lends further support to the idea that schizophrenia plays a role in an individual's likelihood of smoking weed, by showing that the genetic variants predicting schizophrenia can also be used to predict a person's tendency to smoke pot, regardless of their mental health history. This, researchers say, demonstrates that the causal relationship between cannabis use and schizophrenia might not be clear-cut, and that at least a small part of the association might be caused by genetic overlap, where the same genes that predispose certain people to enjoying weed might also predispose others to developing schizophrenia — or both. To tease apart this relationship, researchers took genetic data from recently published studies of schizophrenia, and identified genetic variants associated with the disease. Then, they applied that information to a random sample of about 2,000 healthy Australians to see if those variants could also predict cannabis use. ""more likely to use cannabis, and in greater quantities."" ""There is a well-established link between people who use cannabis and schizophrenia,"" says Robert Power, lead author of the study and a genetic psychiatrist at King's College London. But this study indicates ""that people who are at risk for schizophrenia are more likely to use cannabis, and in greater quantities,"" he says — which means the causal relationship might actually go both ways. Moreover, the genetic variants associated with schizophrenia were predictive for cannabis use in healthy individuals, so there appears to be some genetic overlap between the two. ""These findings are very valuable,"" says Eden Evins, a psychiatry professor at Harvard University who was not involved in the study, ""and suggest that increased genetic risk for schizophrenia increases the chance that someone will use cannabis, and use it heavily."" But Evins doesn't think these results rule out previous findings that cannabis use increases a person's risk for developing schizophrenia. ""Both may be true,"" she says. This sentiment was echoed by Wolfram Kawohl, a psychiatrist at the University of Zurich, who said the results show that ""the connection is more complicated than some people may have thought,"" and that ""both connections may exist parallel along with possible others."" ""I am suspect that this finding will hold out with the test of time."" But Lynn DeLisi, another Harvard University psychiatry professor, isn't convinced. ""I am suspect that this finding will hold out with the test of time,"" she told The Verge in an email. DeLisi points to her own work, which showed there was no difference in family history of schizophrenia between people who smoke weed and people who don't. So, although there might be an interaction between smoking weed and schizophrenia, DeLisi said, it would be need to be shown in ""studies of people using cannabis compared with those who don't, both having a family history of schizophrenia."" Furthermore, DeLisi thinks that today's high rates of cannabis use among teenagers and adults make it hard to link drug use to mental health issues or their genetic predispositions. ""Everyone uses cannabis these days, and I don't think they necessarily have genetic predispositions to do so."" ""The relationship is an ongoing debate in the scientific world — at least what the nature of the association is,"" said Matthew Hill, a cell biologist at the University of Calgary in Canada, who recently published an article dissecting this very relationship, in an email to The Verge. In the article, Hill argued that ""there is little evidence that, at a population level, cannabis use during adolescence is a primary contributing factor in the development of psychiatric illness."" But he also noted that ""there is evidence that in high-risk populations, cannabis can be highly adverse, so arguments claiming that cannabis is innocuous are equally flawed."" Weed affects people with schizophrenia differently When The Verge asked about the risks associated with cannabis use, Hill said that ""there are detailed studies which have demonstrated that cannabis can have very different effects on the brain of someone who is at risk for schizophrenia than someone who isn't."" One 2013 study, for instance, demonstrated that the increased release of dopamine from smoking marijuana is amplified in the brains of people with schizophrenia, as well as in their close relatives. The results of this amplification are poorly understood, but some scientists think that a chronic elevation of dopamine can increase one's likelihood of experiencing psychotic episodes, and make the disorder harder to treat. Moreover, some studies indicate that people who find themselves in the early stages of schizophrenia and who also smoke weed experience larger brain modifications — such as changes in their white matter — compared to those who don't. ""cannabis use worsens the course of schizophrenia."" ""There is definitely some kind of genetic basis to increased vulnerability to these adverse effects [in people with schizophrenia] that go beyond the correlational association discussed in this paper,"" Hill says. Evins agreed. ""It's well known that cannabis use worsens the course of schizophrenia,"" she said, ""so people with schizophrenia should be discouraged from using it."" Furthermore, some studies have found that smoking pot accelerates the development of schizophrenia in those who are genetically predisposed, but that association took a hit in 2010, when researchers found that accounting for things like gender, lifetime mental health history, and socioeconomic status erased the effect. Still, some studies continue to point to this risk. Perhaps the reasons for these contradictory findings is that some individuals with schizophrenia react more strongly to marijuana than others with the same disorder. This was the finding of one 2010 study that demonstrated that 44 out of 121 schizophrenic participants either developed schizophrenia within a month of beginning to smoke marijuana, or saw their psychosis amplified by drug use. Given all of this conflicting evidence, it seems likely that the relationship between marijuana and schizophrenia is even more complex than we once thought. No single gene has been associated with either drug addiction or schizophrenia, so these illnesses are the result of many genes working in combination, Evins said, ""each with a small contribution to the overall risk of developing the disorders."" There's also a plethora of environmental factors that need to be taken into account — most of which we barely understand. This ""doesn't get a lot of attention."" Still, Hill said, the idea that cannabis use and schizophrenia share common genes ""is interesting,"" partly because it highlights a dimension of this relationship that doesn't get a lot of attention. But causality is never easy to confirm, so this study will need to be replicated multiple times. And even then, Kawohl said, researchers probably won't be able to say that ""cannabis use has no consequences for the risk to develop schizophrenia."" Regardless, it's important to remember that schizophrenia only affects a small number of people — about 1 percent of the US adult population — so ""the vast majority of adolescents and young adults who use cannabis won't develop it,"" Evins said. And that's actually a crucial point, because despite all the studies that link schizophrenia and cannabis, few have been able to explain why schizophrenia rates have remained stable — and may actually be declining — in the face of pot's increasing popularity among teens. the economic benefit of limiting pot use is ""pretty small."" ""There may still be a causal role between cannabis and schizophrenia, but our results suggest that this causal role may have been overestimated,"" Power says. This is important, he says, because some people have used cannabis' relationship with psychosis to argue against its legalization. ""Already the actual economic benefit of limiting cannabis use in terms of schizophrenia is pretty small,"" Power says, pointing to a study that found that policymakers would have to stop at least 3,000 adolescents from smoking weed to prevent one case of psychosis from emerging. Still, Power thinks people with a family history of schizophrenia should avoid weed. ""The clinical advice is to stay away from events that might have a potential to cause stress,"" he says, because genes and environment are interconnected. Thus, ""people who are at-risk should try to avoid things that might damage their mental well-being."" These things, he says, include weed.",0.5095789782280539,0.49042102177194613,0.7582489123488406,1489,5.4036265950302216,616,6.5990259740259738,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The largest outbreak of ebola ever recorded is spreading in West Africa, and it’s unlikely to end soon. According to the latest figures from the World Health Organization — which are constantly ticking up as new cases are detected — 528 people have been infected with the virus and 337 have died. That’s already much worse than the previous largest outbreak, when 426 people were infected and 172 died in Uganda in 2000. But this latest outbreak isn’t just infecting and killing more people — it’s also much more geographically spread out. Cases have been recorded in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Some victims turned up in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, and in a town 40 miles from Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, which is worrisome because diseases spread more quickly in densely-populated areas. ""The epidemic is out of control."" Aid organizations are setting up emergency clinics and employing hundreds of international and local health workers. ""The epidemic is out of control,"" Dr. Bart Janssens, director of operations at Doctors Without Borders, said in a statement yesterday. Ebola is an all-around horror show; it’s fast-spreading, deadly, and brutal, one of a class of highly contagious hemorrhagic fevers that cause the blood to attempt to escape the body through any means possible. Late symptoms can include genital swelling, bleeding from the ear, nose, eyes, mouth, and anus, and a skin rash that contains blood. Transmission occurs through sweat, blood, saliva, or sexual fluids. So how scared should we be? Those most at risk by far are the family, friends, and neighbors of those infected. No travel advisory has been issued, and while the international airport in Conakry has started checking temperatures before allowing people to fly, medical authorities don’t think it’s very likely that the epidemic will spread globally. Furthermore, while there is no vaccine or cure for ebola, a patient in a modern hospital given an IV and blood transfusions has a good chance of fighting it off. ""Close contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids is required for human-to-human transmission,"" says Donda Hansen, a health communications specialist at the Centers for Disease Control who is working for World Health Organization (WHO) on the outbreak. ""The virus is spreading because people ill with Ebola are crossing borders to access medical care they perceive as better, families are transporting family members who have died from Ebola to other locations for burial, others refuse medical care out of fear."" In addition, some local communities have burial rites that involve washing the corpse and eating in the same room with it — a good way to catch the disease. The virus is spreading fast locally but unlikely to spread globally Dr. William Fischer, a critical-care doctor and professor at the University of North Carolina (UNC), was pretty scared when the WHO told him to leave his desk job in Geneva and head to Guéckédou, a large town in Guinea, to treat ebola victims. ""The fear was really tough,"" Dr. Fischer, who returned to his wife and two children in North Carolina last week, tells The Verge. ""It was not just about dying or getting infected. I was really worried that I was going to be ineffective. Those concerns were equal."" Dr. Fischer’s time in Guinea was chronicled in his emails to family and friends, which UNC republished with permission. He describes the bulky full-body protective suits that got to be 115 degrees Fahrenheit inside on a not-that-hot day, the chickens that would wander into the isolation ward, and the one patient who would dance around pretending to do calisthenics in order to cheer him up. He also describes the heart-wrenching stories of a 27-year-old man who lost all his strength while his sick sister was in the next room, and  the pregnant woman who had both ebola and malaria and delivered a stillborn fetus. ""Miserable,"" he wrote. One day Dr. Fischer’s clinic received a young boy who had been locked in a house with his mother for four days until she died. The boy died overnight. Despite the wretchedness of the disease, Dr. Fischer says it looks much less dramatic than it does on television. ""It’s not like the movies,"" he says. ""The symptoms are nausea, vomiting, fever, and malaise — meaning weakness or fatigue — and diarrhea. Patients look just like the patients you take care of normally."" The quiet onset is another reason why ebola is so scary. The incubation period is about 21 days, meaning an infected person can travel far and have contact with a lot of people before realizing he or she is sick. Ebola may be spreading to humans through the saliva of fruit bats The first cases in the current outbreak were reported to the WHO in March, which means the epidemic would have started earlier. Ebola may be spreading to humans through the saliva of fruit bats, which nibble on mangoes that later get eaten by humans, says Dr. Hilde de Clerck, a hemorrhagic fever specialist with Doctors Without Borders who spent two months treating patients and setting up clinics in the region. ""Most ebola outbreaks start when a single human being gets infected by the animal,"" she says, but the question of how the outbreak started is ""more of scientific interest."" ""For now, it’s not the most important question. The most important is how we could manage to block the epidemic."" Right now the only way to stop the spread of the virus is to keep the victims from spreading it themselves. Neighboring countries have instituted road stops and border checks to stop the sick from crossing the border, although a quarantine is not advised because it would cause panic and be impossible to enforce. ""You try to quarantine people in one place, they slip out the back or find a way out,"" says Dan Epstein, a communications officer for the WHO. ""The only way really we can stop the spread is education."" Doctors Without Borders, WHO, the Red Cross, and other organizations are working together to combat the epidemic (and all three take donations on their websites). The trajectory of the epidemic is difficult to predict, de Clerck says, but it looks like it will last at least six months — although for the doctors and patients dealing with the devastating disease, that must seem like an eternity.",0.36546856804388783,0.6345314319561122,0.8247973152578415,1087,4.9981600735970559,557,6.1705565529622977,0,0,"Science, US & World, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The change is especially relevant given the massive fraud perpetrated against customers of Target in the fall. During a Congressional hearing last week, Target CFO John Mulligan said the company is accelerating the $100 million effort to switch to the so-called ""chip and pin"" system. The change won't happen all at once The change won't happen all at once. Banks must issue cards with microprocessors and merchants need the right equipment to process the so-called ""chip and PIN transactions,"" which is likely to happen gradually. Additionally, the new equipment also processes ""chip and signature"" transactions, which are less secure but more convenient. So far, many banks have opted to issue chip and signature cards rather than chip and PIN cards. There is pressure to adopt the more secure system, however. Visa, American Express, and MasterCard have announced that banks and merchants that are using less secure technology for face-to-face transactions by October 2015 will be liable for fraudulent purchases. If a customer has a chip and PIN card but the merchant doesn't have a new terminal for it, the merchant is liable for any fraud. And if a merchant has a terminal capable of processing chip and PIN cards, but the bank has not issued a PIN-enabled card to the customer, the burden of liability for fraud shifts to the bank. That's a strong incentive to get up to date. Signatures are so easy to forge — and cashiers so remiss in checking for them — that they're considered a fairly insecure method of authentication. But the chip and PIN system is also not without critics; researchers say thieves could potentially harvest the codes through point of sale systems and ATMs. The new system will also prepare merchants and banks to transition to contactless payments in the near future, which will bring a host of new security challenges.

But how will brands know how their ""rich"" ads should look? Instagram today gave brands their first hints. The company today published The Instagram Handbook for Brands, a book profiling 11 companies that it thinks are doing a great job posting content on Instagram. Example posts come from the likes of Patagonia, Chobani, and Disneyland, and are accompanied by tips like ""share experiences"" and ""find beauty everywhere."" The posts Instagram highlights in its book, and in a series of blog posts starting today, are markedly different from the ultra-composed and polished ad made by Michael Kors that tested back in November. Perhaps Instagram learned that ads would need to feel even more authentic and user-generated to avoid alienating users. User comments on the Kors post were scathing.   A Chobani photo Instagram highlights in its book (left) versus Instagram's Michael Kors photo ad (right) Instagram's brand tips are offered up as ""tools"" for marketers, but there's very likely another agenda at play here. By training top brands to imitate Instagram's wholesome effect, they'll perhaps submit better ads when Instagram rolls them out on a large scale. This kind of hands-on approach is in some ways the opposite of the tactic used by the self-serve ads Facebook helped pioneer. Facebook needs to find new ways to boost its revenue, but is leery of cramming too many ads into users' news feeds, as it perhaps did on its website. Instagram, which has until now only tested a small number of ads, is poised to be the next cash cow for the company — and Facebook doesn't want to blow it. The social network's business has always been about using personal and social data to target ads, but with Instagram, where users can hide behind pseudonyms and little personal information is required, the business will have to be structured a bit differently. Even with 150 million active users — 128 million more than when it was acquired — the app is still mostly a blank canvas for ads.",0.5625359018473403,0.43746409815265974,0.2503276991722106,376,4.9228723404255321,238,5.5966386554621845,0,0,"Apps, Business, Tech, Exclusive",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The Chronicle lists the top 50 American philanthropists every year, and figures needed to top $37.5 million to reach the list this year. Donations from the top contributors totaled $7.7 billion — another $2.9 billion were counted as pledges — with much of the money going to non-profits in the health and science sectors.

The rapid rise in broadcasters is due in part to a new platform for Twitch's streaming service, a home-console system.

For the first time, hacking tops the list of the things respondents were most concerned about, far surpassing every other type of meatspace crime. Specifically, 69 percent of those surveyed said they were ""frequently or occasionally"" worried about ""having the credit card card information [they] have used at stores stolen by hackers."" And almost as many, 62 percent, were ""frequently or occasionally"" worried about having personal information stolen from their computer or smartphone. In contrast, less than half of respondents (45 percent), were worried about their homes being physically burglarized and 18 percent were worried about getting murdered. The survey was conducted earlier this month by telephone (landline and mobile) on a random sample of 1,017 adults chosen across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, as Gallup explains. The fact that hacking topped the list probably shouldn't come as a surprise given the massive hacks of celebrity photos just a few months ago and the continued hackings of major American retail chains and theft of shoppers' credit card information, all of which have been very well publicized. At the same time, this was the first year that Gallup asked all survey respondents about their fears of being hacked (they asked some of them a similar question back in 2013), so there's no historical data with which to put these results in context. Americans may have harbored fears of being hacked above all other crimes for years now, but we wouldn't really know it from Gallup's latest results. The real question is whether the prevailing fear of being hacked is warranted. Compared to other crimes, it probably is: rates of violent crime have been decreasing markedly since a peak in 1993, according to the US Bureau of Justice Statistics. Comparable cybercrime statistics don't go back as far and haven't been collected as regularly, but the same agency took cybercrime surveys in 2001 and 2005 and found that 67 percent of businesses that responded detected at least one cybercrime in 2005 and 74 percent reported being victims of cybercrime in 2001. Other government surveys have found more steady increases in cyber incidents in the past two decades. Complaints of identity theft are also generally on the rise, according to government statistics. While it's difficult to quantify an individual's risk to certain types of crimes without incorporating their own unique habits and proximity to criminals, there's plenty of guidance out there about how to secure your electronic devices from hackers.

The harbingers of journalism's doom refer to dramatic charts, like this one from The Pew Research Center, that show a precipitous decline in newspaper advertising revenue. Fortunately, though, the internet is here to fill the content void, and we have technology barons to thank for becoming our new media benefactors. Amazon's Jeff Bezos, who once peddled quesadillas for Taco Bell, bought The Washington Post last year at a bargain. eBay founder Pierre Omidyar poached prolific security state reporter Glenn Greenwald to start his own publication, The Intercept. Even Facebook wants to get in on the action by convincing publishers to simply give up and post their shit directly on Facebook. And now, there's Verizon. Verizon is backing a publication called Sugarstring that covers technology, culture, and entertainment. All of the advertisements on Sugarstring are for Verizon. The color palette — red, everywhere — screams Verizon. Its about page, which says ""Sugarstring publishes thoughtful tech-focused stories that track humanity's climb towards the new next"" appears to have been written by a corporate robot employed by Verizon. Every page brandishes a badge to let you know that the content you have just consumed has been ᴘʀᴇsᴇɴᴛᴇᴅ ʙʏ ᴠᴇʀɪᴢᴏɴ. There's just two things Verizon won't be presenting, which happen to be two of the biggest stories in the world right now: stories about how Verizon is fucking over America. Verizon's publications prohibit reporters from talking about net neutrality As The Daily Dot has learned, Sugarstring expressly prohibits its reporters from writing anything about domestic surveillance or net neutrality. (But reporting on foreign surveillance, The Daily Dot noted, is just fine!) If you've been reading the news for the past year, you'll know that Verizon is heavily involved in both of these areas. As the country's largest wireless provider it was one of the first companies implicated in the NSA's scandalous call record collection program. And as one of the country's largest internet service providers it has thrown its weight behind killing net neutrality and making the internet worse for everyone. The irony in Verizon's censorship is palpable. The following passage from Sugarstring appears in an article on the internet's ""morality police."" When it comes to news and opinion, censors can have an impact just by closing off channels. As Columbia Law professor and digital activist Tim Wu pointed out in a 2006 article for Slate, ""for every diverse Long Tail""—Chris Anderson’s concept in which seemingly unlimited digital channels theoretically guarantee distribution for even obscure music or books—""there’s a ‘Big Dog’: a boring standardized industry that isn’t sexy like Apple or Amazon but that delivers all that niche content you’re hungry for."" By now, it’s fair to call Apple and Amazon ""standardized industries"" themselves; the audience for an artist’s work that gets vetoed by one of those ""Big Dogs"" will be limited to only those with the tenacity to hunt it down. It's not totally clear if this story is self-parody, considering that Verizon is itself a ""Big Dog"" sitting atop a ""boring standardized industry"" that wants to be a gatekeeper with immense power over the transfer of information. I mean, Tim Wu is the guy who coined the term net neutrality. Verizon is laughing at you. For now, it's easy to shrug off Sugarstring as just another hilariously dumb attempt to make a corporate brand look cool. Its format is somewhere between Digg, BuzzFeed, and Verizon's corporate blog. It appears to gather much of its content from Reddit. It's powered by Wordpress. It inexplicably has 74,000 Twitter followers. It publishes headlines like ""Can you survive without chatting at work?"" and ""Three reasons Neil DeGrasse Tyson is wrong about innovation.""     But in the broader context, Sugarstring is frightening. It resembles a future where enormous corporations that own the pipes through which speech travels also own that speech. Hell, that's not even a vision of the future; Comcast already owns NBC, and its promises for good behavior as a vertically integrated superpower have an expiration date. So far we've been worried about the subtle effects of corporate control of the internet — stuff like data caps, and throttling, and ""fast lanes."" Sugarstring is something entirely different. It's brazen, disrespectful, and deeply cynical. There can only be two possibilities for its existence: Verizon thinks people aren't paying attention, or they're just too stupid to get it. We've asked Verizon if it can handle the truth. We're no Tom Cruise, but we'll update this story if we get a response. Update, 10/29 2:25PM ET: Verizon has just responded to our request for comment with the following statement: SugarString is a pilot project from Verizon Wireless’ marketing group, designed to address tech trends, especially those of interest to our customers. Unlike the characterization by its new editor, Sugar String is open to all topics that fit its mission and elevate the conversation around technology. This is known in the spin business as a ""non-denial denial."" In other words, it's an ambiguous response that doesn't actually address the question being asked but merely appears to. Verizon implies in this response that its editor essentially made up the fact that the publication is not permitted to cover domestic surveillance and net neutrality topics.

The US Federal Communications Commission is beginning to consider a rule change that would put internet TV providers on the same playing field as cable companies when it comes to select regulations. Critically, it would mean that broadcasters wouldn't be able to refuse to let an internet TV provider carry their content.  ""Consumers shouldn’t be shackled to rules that only recognize 20th century technology"" Instead, internet TV providers would be able to negotiate to carry TV stations with the same ability that cable companies and satellite companies can. That should solve solve the recurring issue of internet TV hopefuls being unable to license the content they need to get off the ground. In fact, the FCC is actually just considering extending rules to cover internet TV providers that Congress once put in place to help the emergence of satellite companies — rules that, as you may have gathered, were successful in producing their desired goal. This rule change would cover companies that are broadly known as ""multichannel video programming distributors (MVPD)."" As far as FCC chair Tom Wheeler is concerned, there should be no difference between cable, satellite, and internet TV providers, so long as they're all offering the same service. ""The definition of an MVPD should turn on the services that a provider offers, not on how those services reach viewers,"" Wheeler writes in a blog post today. ""Twenty-first century consumers shouldn’t be shackled to rules that only recognize 20th century technology."" Likewise, the rule change would also mean that current cable providers remain regulated the same way should they move online. The rule change will have to move through FCC proceedings before it's implemented, and plans to make similar changes have died before. But given the current lineup of commissioners, there's reason to believe that it could make it through this time. This proposal is also in part a reaction to the ongoing struggle of Aereo, which was effectively ruled to be a cable company by the Supreme Court but hasn't actually been able to negotiate for content like cable companies, thus leading to what may well be the company's end. Aereo actually filed a letter with the commission earlier this month urging it to take these very steps. ""The FCC is taking a real and meaningful step forward."" ""The way people consume television is rapidly changing and our laws and regulations have not kept pace,"" Aereo CEO Chet Kanojia says in a statement today. ""By clarifying these rules, the FCC is taking a real and meaningful step forward for competition in the video market. The FCC recognizes that when competition flourishes, consumers win."" Wheeler also views this change as a way to promote broadband access and innovation among TV providers. The Commission has heard that the ability to offer TV and internet bundles is a major factor in companies' decisions to build out high-speed internet networks. If internet providers can now begin to offer TV channels over the internet, they'll be able to create those bundles, theoretically making them more likely to build out broadband access so that they can find more customers. Because the rule change should lead to the presence of more TV providers, Wheeler also believes that it might finally prompt companies to offer channels à la carte — the dream of everyone paying way too much for way too many TV channels. That's by far a less certain result of this proposed rule change, but it is more than fair to assume that we'd see increased competition as more companies enter the business.",0.6140222505949543,0.3859777494050457,0.8371190560270753,619,5.0533117932148626,322,6.0807453416149064,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Reuters reports that the legal battle, which has stretched for more than a decade, will result in Comcast paying out $50 million in cash and services to current and former subscribers living in areas mentioned as part of the suit. Comcast will pay out $16.67 million in cash, but no one's in for a huge payday. Considering there are believed to be 800,000 or so people included in the settlement, that gets each subscriber a little over $20 — not even enough to pay a month's cable bill. (And that's not even counting legal fees.) But Comcast is also throwing in more for subscribers that have stuck around through the lawsuit. The company will distribute ""as much as $33.33 million in services"" to those customers, Reuters says. That will come in the form of $15 bill credits, internet speed upgrades, and free video-on-demand rentals. The lawsuit slammed Comcast for buying up its local rivals to built a monopoly and eliminate any real competition in the Philadelphia market; that strategy ultimately gave the company free rein to overcharge customers. Last year, the US Supreme Court threw out another version of the lawsuit that involved a massive pool of 2 million subscribers, finding that the class lacked the necessary cohesion to move their case forward.

And if that does turn out to be the case, the legendary animation house isn’t going out with a bang. Written and directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi, When Marnie Was There has no castles in the sky, warrior princesses, or adorable magical animals; it’s one of the quietest, most understated movies Studio Ghibli has ever made. On the surface, When Marnie Was There has few of the hallmarks of Ghibli’s best-known films, and it doesn’t reach the creative heights of Hayao Miyazaki (Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbour Totoro, The Wind Rises) or Isao Takahata’s (Grave of the Fireflies, Only Yesterday, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya) greatest achievements. But as it burns slowly through to an emotional climax, it captures exactly what we’ll lose if the studio does go away. When Marnie Was There opens in the tradition of similarly subdued Ghibli movies like Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart, placing its main character in a hyper-detailed, authentic depiction of a modern Japanese city. Anna is a troubled 12-year-old girl living in Sapporo, and after she suffers an asthma attack, her foster parents send her away to breathe clean air with relatives in rural Hokkaido. The seaside setting is beautiful, but Anna doesn’t get along with the locals any better than she did in Sapporo, preferring to sit by herself and draw. That all changes when Anna comes across Marnie, an ethereal blonde girl living in a strange mansion across a marsh. Marnie takes a deep interest in Anna right from their first meeting, and her non-judgmental nature helps Anna open up to someone for the first time. There’s something otherworldly about Marnie — Anna has seen a girl like her in dreams before, and at first doubts whether she’s a real person at all. But the connection between them proves so strong that Anna is loath to break it over her uncertainty whether Marnie actually exists. Anna needs Marnie and knows it. Studio Ghibli’s unparalleled artistry and attention to detail are in full effect here, as the animators’ painstaking efforts to capture the nuance and emotion in simple human actions pays off once again. Whether it’s Anna slightly quickening her pace to avoid having to talk to a stranger, or the way her eyes fall and shoulders drop slightly when a relative joins her on a solo errand, Yonebayashi’s direction nails what it feels like to be a kid who just wants to be left alone — making Anna’s eventual happiness at building a friendship with Marnie all the more moving. Less successful are the occasional gaudy CGI embellishments and depth-of-field effects, which don’t do anything but distract from the artwork. When Marnie Was There is based on the book of the same name, which was written by British author Joan G. Robinson and set in Virginia. Unlike many Ghibli movies, however, Yonebayashi grounds the movie firmly in real-world Japan, making some interesting decisions in adapting the characters’ ethnicity. Marnie appears non-Japanese in appearance and name, but Anna is more ambiguous in both regards; she has a particularly strong reaction when another girl compliments her on her pretty, ""foreign"" blue eyes, reinforcing her sense of isolation despite the kind intent. In the end, Anna’s outsider status telegraphs the ultimate connection between her and Marnie, but also adds a cultural dimension rarely seen in mainstream Japanese movies. When Marnie Was There is the second film Yonebayashi has directed for Studio Ghibli,  following 2010’s beguiling The Secret World of Arrietty, and the main thing the two share is a supernatural thread that never overpowers the narrative. The family in Arrietty lives an entirely normal life aside from their self-evident 4-inch-high stature, and the movie never addresses or explains it; meanwhile, Anna is unsure of Marnie’s nature from the start but accepts her as a true friend without reservation. Both films are strong examples of light magical realism, with simple mystic elements that free up the writing to explore universal themes of personal growth and discovery. When Marnie Was There’s ending is easy to see coming, but that doesn’t make Anna’s journey any less satisfying or heartfelt. Yonebayashi left Studio Ghibli earlier this year, however, saying, ""I want to try an action-oriented or fantasy film, which are totally opposite from Marnie."" That’s disappointing — Japan is not exactly lacking for fantasy anime, and Yonebayashi’s departure means Hayao Miyazaki’s son Goro is the only person left on Ghibli’s books with directorial experience. (Goro made his debut with the disastrous Tales from Earthsea in 2006, regaining some stock with 2011’s generally well-received From Up On Poppy Hill.) But for the first time in memory, Ghibli has no upcoming films on its slate. ""At this point, we're not making a new film,"" Hayao Miyazaki told the LA Times in November. ""I think we will not be making any feature films to be shown in theaters."" If Miyazaki is right, When Marnie Was There’s melancholy, elegiac tale takes on a new poignance. Studio Ghibli is the most important producer of hand-drawn cel animation today, and has built up a diverse yet remarkably consistent body of work in its three decades of existence. Its films have the power to move and enchant people like no other, and When Marnie Was There is a tender distillation of what sets Studio Ghibli apart from the anime world. When Marnie Was There opens in New York and Los Angeles today, with a wider expansion to come. It's being shown in dubbed English, or Japanese with English subtitles.",0.8971618215616257,0.10283817843837428,0.1801705670297009,950,5.0726315789473686,531,6.2636534839924671,0,12,"Culture, Entertainment, Movie Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Scientific studies on humans have strict ethical guidelines nowadays, but that wasn't always the case.

LabMD has been in a long and convoluted legal saga over leaked social security numbers for years, but now the story may be changing. What was once seen as a data breach could in fact be extortion at the hands of a security company, one that should have been offering help in the first place. Eurovision is like a super-sized American Idol that's been made several degrees weirder. But just like American Idol, its winners and losers struggle to succeed after the show. We went backstage with one of the bands to see how they're planning to make the most of their fleeting Eurovision fame. Netflix has built a confined chamber — named after the one in Orange Is The New Black — right inside its headquarters for the purpose of putting TVs to the test. We went inside to see how it's trying to get Sony, Samsung, Vizio, and other manufacturers to build better and better TVs. As its new season kicks off, IndyCar is implementing some changes to make things more interesting. That includes making cars a lot faster — but it's also looking like it could make them a lot more dangerous. Here's what it's like to ride in one. The New RepublicBen Crair reports on the use of illegal and ineffective drugs in America’s lethal injection process. As he lay on the gurney, Landrigan thanked his family for attending and spoke his last words: ""Boomer Sooner,"" a lyric from the University of Oklahoma’s fight song. An execution team member began pushing the first drugs at 10:15 p.m. Eleven minutes later, the doctor declared Landrigan dead. For some reason, Ryan asked the execution team to administer the backup drugs to Landrigan’s corpse, but without any blood pressure, it was difficult to depress the syringe. The doctor warned that Landrigan’s vein might rupture, and Ryan called them off. The doctor’s work was done, and Ryan paid him $18,000 cash. He claimed he didn’t learn until later, from news accounts, that the drug that had killed Jeffrey Landrigan was illegal. New York MagazineLisa Miller reports on a school in New York City that’s pioneering a new curriculum meant to boost self-esteem and support minority racial identities. But Fieldston’s program would be bolder, more radical: It would be mandatory rather than voluntary, and built into the school day itself; it would compel participation from children of all races who would at first be separated into racial ""affinity groups""; and it would start in the third grade, with 8-year-olds, an age when many of the kids have only an inchoate sense of what ""racial identity"" means. It would be a boundary-pushing experiment, in other words, in a place that seemed exceptionally hospitable to progressive experimentation — but also, undeniably, a privileged and racially anomalous bubble. Wired Alex French and Howie Khan tell the story of Industrial Light & Magic, a special effects department born out of George Lucas’s necessity. As it turns 40 this year, ILM can claim to have played a defining role making effects for 317 movies. But that’s only part of the story: Pixar began, essentially, as an ILM internal investigation. Photoshop was invented, in part, by an ILM employee tinkering with programming in his time away from work. Billions of lines of code have been formulated there. Along the way ILM has put tentacles into pirate beards, turned a man into mercury, and dominated box office charts with computer-generated dinosaurs and superheroes. What defines ILM, however, isn’t a signature look, feel, or tone—those change project by project. Rather, it’s the indefatigable spirit of innovation that each of the 43 subjects interviewed for this oral history mentioned time and again. It is the Force that sustains the place. Pitchfork Mike Powell hangs out with rising pop icon Shamir in Las Vegas. As for high school, Shamir didn’t like it, which he feels guilty about, because nothing verifiably bad happened: no bullying, no ostracism, no being shoved into the locker. If anything, his complaint is that people liked him, albeit in a reductive, petlike way. ""It was always ‘Shamir With the Guitar’ or ‘Shamir With the Hair,’"" he says—a quirky sprite who dances through life and leaves a spray of emoji diamonds in his wake. ""I wanted to be a rebel so badly,"" he adds, then sighs and moves on.  Nautil.us David Dobbs explains why autopsies are so important. How do we know they’re wrong? Because of so-called autopsy studies. In an autopsy study, researchers perform or collect data from post-mortem dissections of large numbers of dead people; determine definitively why they died; and then compare those findings to the causes of death listed on those people’s medical or death records. These studies reliably find something rather shocking: about 15 to 30 percent of the time, the diagnoses at time of death are wrong—and 5 to 10 percent of the time, that diagnostic error probably helped kill the patient.

Cheekily named ""god mode,"" it addressed one of the most annoying aspects of trying to use Netflix in your browser: scrolling through the company's ever-growing list of movies. Once enabled, it would simply give you one, big list. Instead of sitting there, holding your mouse in anticipation, you could simply find the title you wanted and get on with watching. The web lit up with stories hailing it as a crowning achievement of little-guy ingenuity. TechCrunch called it a fix for a ""wonderful problem."" CNET dutifully noted that it ""saves you from the slow monotonous horizontal scrolling."" Mashable, meanwhile asked, ""Are you listening, Netflix?"" Inside Netflix, though, god mode was old news. In fact, the company had already tried it out on thousands of unsuspecting users years earlier. And it was a total disaster. ""Who the heck has time to go through every title?"" ""It's the difference between what people say they want, and what they actually want,"" says Todd Yellin, Netflix's VP of product innovation. ""Consumers say they want to see every title in a catalog, but who the heck has the time to go through every title?"" Netflix began testing it on small portions of its user base — typically new users, so as not to confuse existing ones. It was as if they'd been given a 60-page restaurant menu. Instead of making people watch more, they ended up watching less. ""We're guessing that people were just overloaded,"" Yellin explained to a group of reporters at Netflix's Los Gatos, California headquarters this week. But Cakirerk wasn't wrong in trying to improve that aspect of Netflix, and Netflix wasn't oblivious to the fact that its old system was just plain bad. In fact, a fix for the issue is one of a few subtle but substantial changes people will notice when they start using a new version of Netflix.com in browsers over the next few weeks. The company began rolling that update out to some of its users this week, and will have it out to everyone else by early next month.   At first blush, the new design doesn't seem markedly different. It's got a black background now, to match what people are used to on their phones, tablets, and TV sets. Those little arrows that scroll through the service at the speed of a glacier are still there, but now they jump between entire rows of choices. And the service does a much better job of letting you see information about a show as you click around, instead of accidentally playing something you only wanted to know more about. Under the hood though, the changes are the culmination of years of research aimed at gleaning every nuance about how humans hunt for things to watch. Netflix has been tossing out breadcrumbs in various configurations, and seeing how we gobble them up. This is the newest handful for us to taste test, and it comes with the hope that we'll feast. To aid in that ongoing psychology project, Yellin and his team are gathering and analyzing a mountain of data, then twisting the dials on what we're all seeing in real time. By the time you see the cover for the next season of House of Cards, it likely will have already gone through several rounds of virtual focus groups to see which design drew the most intrigue. And you yourself could be an unknowing participant in countless other tests designed to get you to watch more, without ever making you feel like you're being led astray. ""It's not good enough just to see what they click on, because you can show the most sensationalistic thing: show a lot of sexiness on the cover, even though there [are] no sex scenes. Then they'll hit play, but they won't watch it,"" Yellin says. ""We're not just looking for clicks here, because that's not a good metric. We're looking for finding the right people to watch the show, because we want to promote our shows to the right people who will actually play it through."" Netflix has snuck fake shows in research emails Changing covers is one of the least crazy things Netflix is doing to gather data. Last year, the company sent a dozen researchers out to conduct more than 1,500 interviews in people's homes to understand how they use Netflix. They also sent out 15 million email surveys, sometimes with fake shows and star ratings to determine which is more effective in getting someone to watch. The exercise has the potential to tell Netflix any number of things, like if people really care about half star differences in ratings, down to if they're still checking their email. Yellin says that while Netflix is paying attention to what people ask for in these surveys and feedback requests, it ultimately spends far more of its energy watching what they're doing on the service. ""Most of our personalization right now is based on what they actually watch, and not what they say they like,"" he says. ""Because you can give five stars to An Inconvenient Truth because it's changing the world, but you might watch Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, three times in a few years ... so what you actually want and what actually say that you want are very different."" The stakes in all these experiments are high. There has never been more competition in online video; between HBO Now, Amazon Prime Instant Video, and Hulu, retaining customers has never been more challenging. Netflix's goal is to keep its 62 million existing users there month after month, while also converting everyone who completes a free trial into a paid subscribers. By changing just one aspect of the service across groups of as many as 100,000 new members, Netflix tries to spot differences that get them to pay. Which should make it clear — Netflix's new design may be the culmination of past research. But it's also the beginning of another test.",0.513008570918616,0.48699142908138404,0.22069377794659106,1029,4.7074829931972788,542,5.7564575645756459,1,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The promotional ramp-up to the movie has also revealed that there’s a complicated backstory in play, with a tie-in book and mysterious promotional videos hinting at secret societies and grand utopian visionaries.

That’s when the team at Disney Imagineering kicked off a viral marketing game called The Optimist. It began with the blog of a young girl named Amelia whose grandfather had worked with Walt Disney, and as players visited real-world locations and examined artifacts that “Amelia” mailed out, they learned about a mysterious group known as Plus Ultra and its connection to the 1964 World’s Fair (a location that’s popped up in Tomorrowland’s trailers). The Optimist culminated at 2013’s Disney D23 Expo, where players who completed the game found themselves welcomed into the ranks of the secret society. At the time I wrote about the experience and spoke with the team at Disney Imagineering about the creation of the game and how it was just one step in the company's exploration of a completely different kind of storytelling experience.  Warning: we discuss some minor spoilers to the movie's backstory below. It was 9:58PM on a Sunday night, and I was standing in Disneyland’s Main Street Cinema with seven people I’d met just hours before. We’d spent the evening trekking through the park and the Anaheim Convention Center, tracking down clues left behind by a secret society called Plus Ultra that counted Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, and Walt Disney himself among its members. A short film played across the room’s six screens, welcoming us to the society and detailing its plans for a city of the future — one based on the unlimited potential of technological progress. A glowing platform slid up out of the darkness, holding pins for everyone in the room. Secret totems that would mark us as members of the order. Welcome to the world of The Optimist. Created by Walt Disney Imagineering — the think tank and creative group that dreams up, designs, and builds attractions for Disney parks — The Optimist is the latest take on the alternate reality game. ARGs are a type of multi-platform experience that first received widespread attention back in 2001 with The Beast. That Microsoft-produced title, designed to promote Steven Spielberg’s A.I., mixed movie posters, websites, and real-world events as it led players through a murder-mystery plot that bled out of their computer screens and into the real world. The Optimist is linked to the mysterious Damon Lindelof and Brad Bird project Tomorrowland, but according to Scott Trowbridge, vice president of creative at Imagineering Research & Development, building an ARG wasn’t an isolated experiment. It’s just one step forward in the company’s larger pursuit of interactive experiences that put the audience at the center of the action — ones that can stretch beyond the historically niche ARG audience and reach more people than ever before. ""What we’re spending a lot of time making sure we get awesome at are deeply immersive, participatory experiences,"" Trowbridge says. Disney has arguably had the ""immersive"" part of the equation down since the original Disneyland opened in 1955, with rides like the Jungle Cruise — and countless others since — becoming classics. As the park has evolved, the attractions have grown more ambitious, but logistics and technological concerns have largely limited Imagineering to creating fixed stories that audiences experience as they move through a ride. Now, Trowbridge says, that’s changing. ""More and more, technology is allowing us to do this. I think culture is kind of inviting us to do this, and frankly, I kind of believe there’s a changing form of narrative,"" he says. Expectations of what a story can be are shifting, allowing Imagineering to experiment with experiences where the guest has an active role in determining what happens next. Think of it as an open-world video game that you play in real life. ""They can become much more immersive and engaging because the stories are much more personal,"" he says. ""You’re participating in the story, not just being told a story."" It’s an evolution that doesn’t just impact the audience; it requires a dramatically different approach from creators as well. ""You’re not authoring a specific fixed narrative,"" Trowbridge explains. ""You’re authoring a story system, a story world, that has certain fixed points but that allows for various degrees of collaboration, various degrees of co-authorship."" It requires that the creators behind the scenes — ""puppetmasters"" in ARG parlance — listen and observe, so the audience’s actions can help evolve the story. ""Optimist was an example of that, where there were some spaces designed in the structure for that audience voice to be influential.""   Some of these projects take the shape of transmedia tales, but the principles can also be applied to part of an attraction, or contained within a theme-park adventure. At Walt Disney World, Imagineering has run ""play tests"" with a pirate game called The Legend of Fortuna, where guests interact with live actors and even take on role-playing duties themselves. Imagineering’s work on this front was also on full display during Disney’s D23 Expo earlier this month. A play test for a treasure hunt was happening on-site, where attendees were tasked with seeking out ""archaeologists"" throughout the convention center. Elsewhere, an animatronic fortune teller named El Fortuno interacted with the audience thanks to a live performer and a sophisticated combination of sensor arrays — the kind of behind-the-scenes technology that could tell a future animatronic character how many people were standing in front of it and what emotions their expressions indicated, allowing it to tailor its responses accordingly. And then, of course, there was The Optimist. Launched on July 3rd, the game started as many ARGs do: with a blog. A fictional college student named Amelia began writing about her grandfather, Carlos, and the strange things she found in his apartment after he died. A Twitter account followed, and players were soon hunting through the history of the 1964 World’s Fair, where It’s a Small World debuted. A mysterious artist named Wallace appeared online, pointing participants to some of Walt Disney’s favorite locations. Multiple real-world meet-ups followed as players discerned the outlines of the mysterious society, and Wallace himself hosted a booth during all three days of the Expo.   There attendees could sit down and chat with the character — and if you had the right password, you’d receive a map that sent you off on the final adventure. I’d followed The Optimist from afar, but at D23 I jumped in with both feet. Just in terms of execution, the game held several advantages from the start. Using the real history of Walt Disney and the World’s Fair as a backdrop gave the fictional elements an immediacy and believability, and the Expo mission was designed to require real-world collaboration; Wallace handed out several different maps, and you couldn’t solve the puzzles unless you paired up with other players. While diving through audio file spectrograms to glean clues is fun, it’s nothing compared to the bonds you make with total strangers as you unearth story beats in a physical location. My group grew from two, to five, to eight. Sometimes we interacted with actors playing knowing society agents, other times we worked from written clues. It only took a few hours to complete the quest, but as we wound past the other park guests a sense of momentum took hold. There’s something about being a group with a secret in a sea of thousands. It pulls you deeper into the fiction; it makes you want to believe. The most striking difference, however, was the tone. ARGs often traffic on dystopian terror or paranoia, and while The Optimist is about a secret society, it’s one whose aim is to create a peaceful, technological utopia. Yes, this is Disney we’re talking about, but the name of the game is no coincidence, and the players I encountered along the way reflected that mindset — creating an overall experience that felt much more accessible than any ARG I’d played before. Trowbridge explains that the shift was a conscious choice. ""A lot of time [ARGs] are done around certain kinds of genres of film or activity,"" he says. ""So really, we were trying to say, ‘We want to see if we can broaden out our audience for this.’"" To that end, the team looked beyond just delivering on the treasure hunt and mystery elements. ""Some of the other things we really challenged ourselves with were, ‘Can we actually create an emotional resonance with this? Can we actually speak to, with these kind of experiences, an audience that hasn’t typically engaged in this kind of thing?’"" For those that followed The Optimist from its onset, the heart of the game was the relationship between Amelia and her mother, Tanya. Amelia's constant digging causes strain in their relationship, and since the players were doing the investigating they were implicated in the rocky relationship between mother and daughter. The game’s emotional climax came when Tanya appeared in person at the Main Street Cinema to learn about her father’s involvement with the society firsthand — surrounded by a number of Optimist players. Hastin Zylstra, a Disney fan that followed the game from the very beginning, live-streamed the event to players that couldn’t attend. ""What amazes me is that from the moment she showed up, we [game players] never dropped out of character,"" Zylstra says. ""This concept of being able to share with a character was a really interesting sort of emotional feeling. Because you know, I’ll 100 percent admit, when she went in the cinema and saw the video, and called Amelia on the phone — I was in freakin’ tears."" However, with the art form still in its relative infancy, people with experience working in these mediums are still somewhat rare. It’s an issue that led to the creation of Imagineering’s Living Worlds program. Announced in 2012, Living Worlds is a sort of Sundance screenwriting lab for participatory and transmedia projects; artists can submit their idea, and if they make the final cut they’ll have the opportunity to have their concept produced by the Imagineering team. ""The real goal is to actually develop a community of storytellers that are going to be good at this kind of thing,"" Trowbridge says, ""so what we’re trying to do is to find ways to provide energy, provide momentum, provide a body of experience for storytellers in that space."" And what about Tomorrowland? When director Brad Bird hopped aboard the film, it was described as a ""multi-platform"" project — and the symbol of the ARG’s secret society is plastered all over the materials Lindelof and Bird say inspired the film. Is The Optimist really over? ""Well, Amelia is still tweeting, maybe that’s a question best asked of her,"" Trowbridge tells me. ""I certainly wouldn’t want to speak on her behalf.""

It's mostly films, but the styles, genres, and tones are just wildly different. And while some of the films are big — like Steve Jobs and Pan — they're big in different ways than we've come to expect. No superheroes, no laser guns. Just big personalities. That makes watching through this week's best trailers a bit more fun than usual. There's 15 below and a lot of interesting ideas to check out.   It's hard to believe that this movie is already happening after how long it bounced around without finding a star or a director. The good news, of course, is that it ended up with Michael Fassbender and Danny Boyle. A first look at what they're making came out on Sunday, and it's a great start. Tech fans may take issue with some of the details, but it seems to be nailing the tone. It's out October 9th.   Pan looks like a huge and charismatic reimagining of the origins of Peter Pan. This trailer may be all over the place, but it at least looks like a swashbuckling, vibrant, fairy-tale adventure. It'll be in theaters October 9th.   I remember the good ol' days... of like last year... when Maze Runner was actually about kids being trapped in a maze. Now the series is running into the Prison Break problem: they've escaped the maze... now they somehow have to wind up in another one. Instead of a maze, this film has them dealing with a post-apocalyptic city and shopping malls. Should this go down like Prison Break, they'll probably be back in a maze by next year. It'll be released on September 18th.   Pixels has such a great premise — that everyone's favorite retro game characters come to life — but it somehow goes so wrong. It looks like a movie based around the broad Adam Sandler and Kevin James comedy that we've come to expect, when it could have been a fun adventure with some classic characters. Still, here's hoping something interesting comes out of it. It's out July 24th.   This looks like it should be pretty great. Scream Queens is like a horror version of Mean Girls: it's incredibly stylized, incredibly over the top, and there's a ton of comical murder. Also, Jaime Lee Curtis is involved and somehow Ariana Grande shows up. It starts on Fox this fall.   I love/hate this trailer so, so much. But the first half, in particular, is amazing. This movie has Zac Efron playing a young DJ, but it's basically about life as a millennial, seeing the possibility of fame and success all around you, and having all of the tools to create something meaningful right at your fingertips. It's inherently indulgent and inherently trite. And this trailer just nails all of that in ways good and bad. It's out August 28th.   Me and Earl and the Dying Girl was easily the biggest hit of Sundance this year, and it'll make so much sense why when you see its trailer. It's emotional, it's quirky, and — yeah — it involves filmmaking. It's hard to tell on which side of the charming / overly quirky divide it lands on, but it's clear that a lot of people are really into this film. It's out June 12th.   Another Sundance hit, Dope's trailer comes with a ton of style and charisma that quickly explains why people have expressed so much love for the movie. It'll be out June 19th.   Could anything be more heartwarming than this? Batkid Begins documents how San Francisco transformed itself into Gotham City so that a five-year-old cancer survivor could live out his wish of being Batman. Sure, you probably saw all about this on the news. But that really doesn't make this movie look any less touching. It'll be out in select theaters starting June 26th.   Amy is getting warm reviews out of Cannes for its deep look at Amy Winehouse, the incredibly talented singer who died in 2011, at 27 years old. After watching this trailer, it's hard to not be interested in seeing more. It'll be out July 3rd.   I really love the look of this. Runoff's trailer paints it as a quiet and gorgeous look at a woman who's trying to keep a grasp on her farm as it starts to be taken away from her. The tone comes off as uncomfortable in such a great way, and I love how it's shot. The film opens on June 26th.   This just looks wonderful. It's a movie about a long-distance relationship and what it's like to keep in touch over the internet. Webcams and Google Maps play a big role, and it all seems like it should add up to a very charming look at a uniquely modern relationship. It'll be in theaters and on-demand starting July 10th.   This isn't really a trailer — it's more of a proof of concept. But this teaser for The Last Black Man in San Francisco has rightfully been getting a ton of buzz this week, even though the movie hasn't entered production yet. The creators of it made this long trailer to give people an idea of what they're making, and they're running a campaign on Kickstarter for funds. They've nearly met the goal, and it's easy to see why people are so interested: it already seems like a sweet and smart look at life in San Francisco, particularly in the face of the city's growing economic and cultural divide. They're hoping to have it out next year.   Sofia Coppola + Bill Murray + anything = yeah, we're excited.   I wouldn't call this trailer one of the ""best"" this week, but it contains what will surely be a Keanu Reeves performance for the ages. Everything else looks remarkably bad.",0.600938847000283,0.399061152999717,0.16496362433862435,1014,4.3786982248520712,502,5.6215139442231079,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

He explained that his goal was to ensure that Windows 10 on the desktop was as popular as possible because it would drive developers to create apps — which would then turn into Windows Phone apps since they're essentially the same platform. In fact, Nadella contends that the desire to drive Windows app development was also one of the reasons Microsoft re-emphasized the Start Menu in Windows 10. ""It's not because I just want to bring back the old. It's because that's the best way to improve the liquidity our store,"" Nadella said. Apparently the Windows store is going to be very present in the Start Menu, and thereby drive app development: ""Windows 8 was great except that nobody discovered the store. In Windows 10, the store is right there and done in a tasteful way."" Nadella wrapped his discussion about phones by comparing Microsoft to Apple right before it had its renaissance. That started with the ""colorful iMacs"" and he asked Foley (and, presumably, all the investors who are wondering what the heck Microsoft is up to in mobile) to give Microsoft a little space to get started again. Nadella also addressed a number of other topics, including Azure and the new GigJam platform. On the cancellation of the Surface Mini, he said, ""What I want us to stand for is not have envy for somebody else's success."" It seems like he's applying the exact same philosophy to phones. Foley's wide-ranging interview is worth a read in its entirety.

Hell, it happened so slowly that it took  me three years to notice. But Gmail’s Priority Inbox quietly changed my professional life for the better. Google announced Priority Inbox in beta way back in August of 2010. At the time, I was unwilling to relinquish so much control over something so vital to an “experimental” new email feature. I was an expert email user, after all, confident in my workflow and the robust set of filters I had defined. But sometime around 2012 I caved and decided to let Google automatically filter my business Gmail account into three sections: Important, Starred, and Everything Else. Looking back it was one of the best computing decisions I ever made.   At first Google’s machine learning algorithms did a reasonable job at figuring out what was important. It was far from perfect but I wasn’t expecting much. So I kept at it, diligently following Google’s advice to mark messages as either ""important"" or ""not important"" as they arrived, adding a star to those I wanted to deal with later. Email from an established industry contact I’ve known for years: important. Email pitch from yet another Indiegogo campaign: not important. Wielding my thumb of approval like Caesar as I slashed the chaff from my inbox. Today, three years later, I might have to promote / demote the importance of one in every 200 messages — but that pales in comparison to the labors I would endure without Google’s help. Google published a research paper in 2011 that gave some insight into the smarts behind Priority Inbox. It’s full of math and graphs if you’re curious. But what stood out was the claim that Priority Inbox users spent 6 percent less time reading mail overall, and 13 percent less time reading unimportant mail. That was four years ago and we know that Google's neural networks keep getting smarter.   Anecdotally, I feel like I’m saving a lot more than 6 to 13 percent. Google's sorting makes it very easy to quickly scan messages, which is especially useful in the Gmail app on my phone. I've also limited disruptions significantly by setting notification alerts to ""Important Only."" And best of all, I can bulk archive my ""not important"" emails — about half of the 80 messages I receive each day — confidently with just a single click in my desktop browser.  Having finally realized how smart Priority Inbox is, and how much it's helped simplify the deluge of communications I receive, maybe it’s time to give Google Inbox another try?

But for the past few years, an increasing number of researchers have started to focus their attention on another important risk factor: environmental pollutants. These neurotoxins, which include everything from pesticides, to mercury and diesel, are thought to alter brain development in fetuses. Now, a new study further confirms this link by showing that pregnant women who live within a mile of farms and fields where pesticides are employed see their risk of having a child with autism increase by 60 percent — and that risk actually doubles if the exposure occurs in the third trimester. ""Pesticides are one of the toxicants that appear to have the strongest association with autism,"" says Dan Rossignol, an autism expert at Jeff Bradstreet's International Child Development Resource Center in Florida who did not participate in the study, published today in Environmental Health Perspectives. These latest results, he says, ""strengthen that association."" In the study, researchers linked data from the California Pesticide Use Report to the residential addresses of 970 children participating in the ongoing Childhood Autism Risks from Genes and Environment (CHARGE) study. This allowed the scientists to make connections between various developmental delays, and the types of chemicals that mothers may have been exposed to before conception, and during pregnancy. They also took note of prenatal vitamin intake, socio-economic status, and metabolic disorders during pregnancy to avoid interference by possible confounders. the risk could go up ""as much as threefold."" ""Women who live within a mile of organophosphate or pyrethroids agricultural pesticide applications were more likely to have a child with autism spectrum than women living further away,"" said Janie Shelton, an epidemiologist at the University of California Davis and lead author of the study, in an email to The Verge. Currently, 1 in 68 American children have some form of autism spectrum disorder. But the risk could go up ""as much as threefold"" when women are exposed to organophosphates later in pregnancy, Shelton said. This means that scientists need to ""investigate [these results] further, while taking preventive steps to decrease exposure to women during and just prior to conception."" For Rossignol, ""the only type of study that would have been better"" would have been a study ""where women were followed before, during, after pregnancy — as well as their babies — to determine if, over time, those higher exposure to pesticides had a higher risk of autism."" Richard Frye, an autism researcher at the University of Arkansas who was not involved in the study, agrees with Rossignol, and pointed out in an email that ""there could be bias in the sample of patients because the participants volunteered for the study."" This means that these participants are the kinds of people that that ""seek medical care for their children"" — which isn't necessarily representative of all parents. But overall, both scientists praised the study's design. pregnant women should avoid contact with agricultural pesticides Shelton and her team would like to continue the research — if they can get more funding. One of their goals is to find out if certain sub-groups are more vulnerable to pesticide exposure. But, regardless of the outcome, Shelton thinks the message is clear: Pregnant women should avoid contact with agricultural pesticides. ""The neurotoxicity of many agricultural agents have been suspected from animal studies for sometime,"" Frye said, so ""this information needs to be taken seriously for not only expecting women, but women who are planning to become pregnant."" He thinks that taking steps to prevent autism and other developmental delays is ""much better for society"" than treating children ""once they have been born with such abnormalities."" But to do that, he said, we need to proactively educate mothers about the risks — and what they can do to fight back. ""Simple things like proper nutrition and folate supplement [intake] is still suboptimal in some areas,"" but these are ""simple factors that can have a large impact at preventing autism and developmental disorders.""",0.47920371317303406,0.520796286826966,0.8582398932759457,681,5.3729809104258441,383,6.511749347258486,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The machine was a self-proclaimed quantum computer, commercially available to anyone with $15 million to spend, and attracting the attention of everyone from NASA to the NSA. One of the computer’s buyers was Google,which launched a new lab to test the device's powers more rigorously than they’d ever been tested before.This October, the lab announced a major discovery, providing stronger evidence for quantum effects within the D-Wave 2 than anyone had previously found. As D-Wave had claimed, its device really was quantum-powered — and Google’s big research bet seemed to be paying off. The team found no clear advantage to the quantum computer But today, the D-Wave 2 is facing its first big stumble. A study in Science found that the quantum device is no faster than conventional computing, calling into question the entire premise of Google's lab and D-Wave's machines. Led by scientists at ETH Zurich, the research team matched up the quantum machine against conventional computers on a set of problems intended to suit the quantum machine's strengths. (The project also got a crucial assist from Microsoft Research, which tested out the classical simulations on its high-powered computer clusters.) Once the results were in, the team found no clear advantage on either side. The D-Wave machine might be quantum-powered, but it didn't run any faster because of it. ""We haven't seen any fundamental limits to performance."" The research was hoping to find what’s called ""quantum speedup,"" the property that lets a quantum computer perform tasks faster than a conventional one, with more and more advantage as the problems grow more complex. The speedup is quantum computing's big advantage: with it, a quantum computer could tackle mind-bogglingly complex problems that would take a conventional computer years or even centuries. Without it, you're left with a lot of expensive hardware and no clear advantage. ""It's hard to show that the speedup isn't happening,"" says Matthias Troyer, who co-authored the Science paper. ""But if you don't find the speedup, you can't show that the machine is better than a classical device.""  The results don't rule out the speedup entirely, but they're not encouraging — and there are plenty of other reasons for researchers like Troyer to be pessimistic. D-Wave's computers are based on a structure called quantum annealing, which many quantum computing experts think is doomed from the start. Since D-Wave's work outpaced much of the academic literature on the topic, there's still no theory for how the quantum speedup might emerge from an annealing-based machine. ""Most scientists would not set out to build a machine without knowing what it can do."" It's still possible that testing other problems might turn up the missing speedup. In fact, D-Wave representatives point to recent work by USC's Itay Hen as evidence that this is already happening. And even without the speedup, D-Wave is still going toe-to-toe with some of the most powerful conventional computing clusters in the world. Jeremy Hilton, D-Wave's VP of processor development, says the company's computers could surpass state-of-the-art classical computing within just a few years. ""We haven't yet seen any fundamental limits to performance that cannot be improved with design changes,"" Hilton says. And then there's Google's lab. The Quantum AI Lab is still testing D-Wave's limits too, although the company declined to comment on when the lab might publish its own results. As with most research, it's a slow, gradual process — a process that’s only now testing out the ambitious promises of the D-Wave 2. ""Most scientists would not set out to build a machine without knowing what it can do,"" Troyer says. ""Most scientists would first think a bit more about it.""",0.2946446483941756,0.7053553516058244,0.19810104255713978,628,5.2484076433121016,336,6.166666666666667,0,0,"Google, Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's the main conclusion of a study, published on Wednesday in PLOS ONE, in which researchers identify 18 species of spiders that have been observed catching fish. Those specimens, reports National Geographic, include the US' six-spotted fishing spiders and the UK's great raft spiders. Marie Herberstein, a spider behavior expert at Macquarie University in Australia, told National Geographic that ""fish predation by spiders has always been a bit of an oddity."" But the study makes a ""compelling argument"" that the behavior is widespread — information that she says came as ""a surprise.""  (Duncan Reid, Yale University, PLOS ONE) But how do these spiders do it? According to the study's authors, they can ""anchor their hind legs to a stone or a plant, with their front legs resting on the surface of the water."" And since these arachnids are often ""sit-and-wait predators,"" all a spider has to do is hang around until an unsuspecting fish, or insect, touches its legs from beneath the water. Moreover, their mouths are strong enough to pierce scaly flesh, and they can inject lethal neurotoxins into a fish as they crush it. Then, once the fish is dead, the spider can drag it to a dry spot, and inject it with chemicals that liquefy its insides, making it much easier to consume. chemicals that liquefy a fish's insides What's perhaps most compelling, however, is that these spiders are often capable of catching fish that are much larger than they are. The authors think, for example, that the largest fish-eating spider, which weighs in at 0.4 ounces (7 grams), might be able to catch a 1-ounce (30-gram) fish.

That laissez-faire approach incubated some of the nastiest places on the internet, including subreddits like ""Fat People Hate"" — one of the communities that was just banned. So now that Reddit is taking more control, the site's angry trolls are ready to burn down the house.

""I remember when Digg when [sic] down this road - it was about 5 minutes before I first created a Reddit account."" The great irony in all this hair-trigger martyrdom is that Reddit has always been friendly to censorship. For most of the site's history the most meaningful rules were created and enforced by its community moderators, who could be anyone that decided to create a subreddit. Reddit moderators have censored all kinds of material, including reputable journalism. It's never actually been a model of free speech, unless the ideal of free speech includes 6,000 nations run by the kind of tyrants who have the time and inclination to moderate internet message boards. The First Amendment continues to elude internet trolls Of course, it's not clear that a handful of moderators at Reddit (the company) are superior to a distributed community of moderators at Reddit (the community). The only sympathetic part of the outrageous response to today's bans is that expecting a small bureaucracy to manage such a massive community could lead to uneven or unfair results, especially if its definition of harassment is dubious. Part of that is Reddit's fault, because it's still afraid to go all the way and purge its most insidious cesspools of hate speech. The company says ""we're banning behavior, not ideas"": a policy far too nuanced for angry trolls who mistakenly believe the First Amendment is essentially a license to, say, walk into someone's living room and mock them for being fat. And really, that's what we're talking about here. A bunch of people who are mad that a  private company (Reddit) isn't willing to tolerate vicious mockery and other toxic behavior in its living room. There is no grand censorship happening here, despite what these trolls want you (and each other) to believe. The reason the internet is so wild is that it's actually not like the town square. If you want to spew outrageously racist stuff, guess what, there are plenty of spaces online for you to express yourself. Ku Klux Klan message boards and 8chan will be happy to welcome you. But if these people — the fat shamers, the white supremacists, the Gamergate zealots — constitute a critical mass of users who are capable of destroying Reddit by leaving it for another site, then what is Reddit's value beyond serving those keen for loathing and abuse?

According to the admin, these last four ranged from 149 to 3071 subscribers, although in r/fatpeoplehate's case, ""more than 5,000"" is a bit of an understatement; the last Reddit metrics (and a Google cached page) put it at around 151,000 subscribers. ""We're banning behavior, not ideas."" Reddit's policy, according to the admin, is based on specific instances of harassment rather than general offensiveness. ""We will ban subreddits that allow their communities to use the subreddit as a platform to harass individuals when moderators don’t take action. We’re banning behavior, not ideas,"" reads the post. That means that some apparently more offensive subreddits have been left online. One of these is the intensely racist r/coontown, a fact several commenters brought up. ""While we don't agree with the content of the subreddit, we don't have reports of it harassing individuals,"" an admin replied. Reached for comment, a Reddit spokesperson elaborated slightly. ""All five [subreddits] had numerous complaints that they were harassing people both on and off Reddit,"" she said. There are somewhere around 650,000 subreddits, so shutting down five may seem negligible. But it's the latest step in a long debate over how broad the massive site's content restrictions should be. Over the past several years, the generally anything-goes Reddit has slowly shifted these limits to exclude sexually suggestive pictures of minors, ""creep shot"" forums dedicated to surreptitiously capturing sexualized pictures of women, and a subreddit that was central to distributing leaked celebrity nudes last year. The site has had long-standing policies against spam, vote manipulation, and posting ""personal information"" like someone's address or employment information. Deciding which subreddits engage in harassment is going to be a difficult problem, especially because it's hard to even agree on what constitutes harassment — and that assumes everyone involved is acting in good faith, which almost certainly won't be the case. Then again, the same applies to categories like ""personal information,"" an issue that came to a head when Gawker posted an exposé of one of the site's most vicious trolls. In a statement to The Verge, the company says said the site is taking ""a step-by-step approach"" to the recent harassment changes.

These days Icahn proudly wears the moniker ""activist investor,"" and has been using his billions to shake things up at technology firms like Netflix, Dell, eBay and Apple. Why has one of the original ""barbarians at the gate"" returned to stir up trouble in tech? ""Right now, tech companies are overflowing with cash and are extremely well-valued compared to other sectors,"" explains Joshua Brown, a veteran stock trader-turned-money manager. ""Icahn is the one guy with enough money of his own to grab these companies by the lapel and say, 'Listen motherfucker, I’m not going away until you give me what I want.’"" ""Icahn is the one guy with enough money of his own to grab these companies by the lapel."" What exactly does he want? That depends on the situation. With Apple, he is eager to loosen the purse strings on its massive stockpile of overseas cash. With Dell, he was fighting to prevent the company from going private unless it paid a higher premium to shareholders. He wanted Netflix to sell itself to the highest bidder and he hopes eBay will take his advice and spin out PayPal into a separate company. In every case he’s looking for a major shakeup that will ""unlock value"" for shareholders, himself included. To understand Icahn’s seemingly unending appetite for high level corporate confrontations, you need to go back to his roots. In the 1980s, a class of high-profile investors rose out of the world of leveraged buyouts (LBOs). Typically this meant they were finding companies with strong balance sheets, borrowing heavily against that cash flow to buy up stock, then attempting a forced takeover of said company. Companies took to buying back the shares Icahn controlled at a premium Investors like Icahn would sell junk bonds for 90 percent or more of the funds they needed to acquire a stock position large enough to wrest control of board seats. From there it was a matter of unlocking value at the company, typically by selling off assets, spinning off valuable divisions, or shedding employee overhead. When the stock rose on these moves, the ""raiders"" would sell out, pocketing a nifty profit, and sometimes saddling the company they had invaded with much of the debt built up to acquire its stock in the first place. Companies took to buying back the shares Icahn controlled at a premium, a practice known as ""greenmailing,"" rather than trying to battle him in the boardroom. This obviously raised many eyebrows in both government and finance as a ruthless and unsustainable business practice. It was a particularly heated topic after Icahn’s takeover of TWA, the legendary airline founded by Howard Hughes. He used cheap debt to finance the takeover and a few years later took the company private. It then became his piggybank, providing the cash Icahn used as collateral in a number of big deals. Icahn eventually sold off TWA’s most valuable routes, saddled the company with $540 million in obligations, and pocketed a hefty profit for himself on the way out. When the company went bankrupt in 1992, it was viewed by many, especially in the former TWA hub of St. Louis, as the raping and pillage of a corporate icon. (NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images) ""The mantra of the raiders was, ‘greed is good.’"" In researching the story I chatted with my own father, who worked at a company called Papercraft in the 1980s. He remembers with grim humor the era of leveraged buyouts. ""A lot of corporations back then put more emphasis on rewarding the community and employees than maximizing shareholder value,"" he said. ""The mantra of the raiders was, ‘Greed is good.’"" The new owners made drastic cuts and improved the bottom line. But often they also weighed the company down with debt based on wild predictions about how they could transform its potential. Papercraft went bankrupt six years after the buyout, and the junk bonds issued to buy it became worthless. The Carl Icahn of today is simultaneously a gentler and more frightening opponent for one simple reason: he no longer needs any debt to buy his way into multibillion-dollar firms. Over the last decade, through a series of successful moves, Icahn has become the sole force behind Icahn Enterprises LP, a diversified holding company that puts him in command of roughly $24 billion in capital. ""As essentially the wealthiest individual hedge-fund manager of all time, he is in an extremely rare position,"" explains Brown. ""Nobody can tell him what to do or what not to do."" ""Nobody can tell him what to do or what not to do."" Interestingly, in the age of social media, Icahn has discovered that he doesn’t necessarily need to put huge mountains of cash to work in order to get his way. ""His modus operandi hasn’t changed much since the '80s,"" says Paul Kedrosky, an investor and author of the popular finance blog, Infectious Greed. ""But he’s learned that he can use the megaphone of Twitter to do a lot of the heavy lifting."" All it took was a single tweet from Icahn to send the value of Apple shares up 5 percent, or roughly $17 billion. Few people see Icahn’s moves as anything like the predatory raids of the '80s. While corporations in my father’s time might not have moved fully into the modern era, today’s technology giants have few employees relative to their size, accountants sizing up every tax loophole, and plenty of fat around the middle. ""Tech companies have gotten away for far too long with far too much cash on their balance sheets,"" says Kedrosky. ""I applaud Carl for forcing people to think hard about why they are carrying so much, and for pushing them to return some of it to investors."" Apple shares rose 5 percent on a tweet from Icahn Of course it's not all benevolent bullying. The older, more rapacious Icahn and his newer, milder self mingle together in his recent demand that eBay spin off PayPal. He did this after building up a roughly 1 percent stake, arguing that each individual company would be worth more as a standalone business than they are under the safe corporate roof.  It’s not the first time someone has suggested this play, as PayPal has consistently outgrown its parent company and contributed a wider margin to its profits. Spinning it out would no doubt create a handsome reward for current shareholders, but probably weaken eBay in the long run. It’s a classic Icahn move — one that on paper could be justified as ""shareholder activism,"" — but often has little upside for the company, its employees, and its longer-term stakeholders. Of course there are numerous occasions where Icahn applied pressure but failed to force a change in management or strategy. In some cases he lost money on these outings, but just as often he has profited, as the media coverage around his takeover bids prompted a dramatic run-up in the share price. In a recent example, Netflix refused to bend to his will, yet Icahn earned at least $825 million because of the rise in its stock. ""He has a great eye for companies with upside,"" says Brown. ""A lot of times, even when he gets nothing he asks for, he wins.""",0.5148995223773557,0.4851004776226443,0.8401988437806173,1275,4.8674509803921566,666,6.1126126126126126,0,0,"Apple, Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

So when CVS announced its decision earlier this week to stop stocking tobacco products in order to establish itself as a committed health care provider, the news was on every front page. Immediately, competitor Walgreens flip-flopped on a statement it made last year about selling cigarettes and announced it was ""evaluating"" the possibility of dumping them. But analysts say the announcement is a manifestation of an existing trend, rather than the sign of a new one. CVS’s decision to forfeit $2 billion in revenue will have little impact on the industry, they say, and no impact on people smoking. Another competitor, Rite Aid, announced it’s sticking to tobacco for now, while other chains such as Dollar General just started selling cigarettes last year. Even if CVS did trigger a mass exodus of newly health conscious pharmacies from the tobacco market, it wouldn’t make much difference. Less than 4 percent of cigarettes are sold in pharmacies versus 16 percent in convenience stores, 21 percent in tobacco stores, and 48 percent in gas stations, according to market research from Euromonitor. The US would also just be catching up to the rest of the world, where many countries consider selling cigarettes in pharmacies hypocritical. The sale of tobacco products in pharmacies is illegal in most of Canada, for example. If pharmacies stop stocking tobacco products, this ""would simply bring the US into line with wider international tobacco distribution norms,"" says Shane McGuill, Euromonitor’s tobacco expert. Even if CVS inspires pharmacies to drop cigarettes en masse, it wouldn’t make much difference The news is still bad for the US tobacco industry. CVS’s move is part of the overall ""dwindling enthusiasm"" for tobacco in the US, McGuill writes in a blog post. Cigarette sales fell 31 percent between 2003 and 2013 with no signs of rebounding. With public smoking bans on the rise, brands have shifted to a ""total tobacco"" strategy, pushing snuff, snus, nicotine lozenges, and e-cigarettes. RJ Reynolds, the second-largest tobacco company in the US, offered a gracious statement in response to CVS’s decision. ""We value the long-term relationship we had with CVS and respect their commercial decision,"" a representative says in an email. ""We will work with them as they transition out of the tobacco category in the coming months."" But the company’s relationship with CVS likely isn’t entirely over. Like most tobacco companies, RJ Reynolds also makes e-cigarettes — which could potentially replace traditional cigarettes on CVS shelves. The pharmacy doesn’t sell e-cigarettes yet but says it is ""monitoring"" them — a common line from retailers as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dawdles on releasing regulations for how the products are marketed and sold. Like many US pharmacies, CVS is pushing further into health care by adding in-store clinics and basic medical services. The company needs to know whether e-cigarettes fit this new image. If the FDA determines that e-cigarettes are safe and can be used as a smoking cessation aid, it’s likely that CVS will snap them up, and be more profitable as a result: e-cigarette sales doubled in 2013 to $1.5 billion, and are projected to surpass cigarette sales by as early as 2023, according to Bloomberg Industries. When asked whether their tobacco products ban would affect their decision on whether to sell e-cigarettes in the future, CVS indicated it would not. ""There is no tobacco in e-cigarettes,"" a representative tells The Verge. ""FDA is evaluating whether they are effective nicotine replacement products with any health benefit."" ""There is no tobacco in e-cigarettes."" The FDA, which regulates cigarettes and tobacco products, was supposed to issue proposed regulations for e-cigarettes back in October. The agency only regulates e-cigarettes that are marketed as therapeutic devices, which is why most e-cigarette companies shy away from claiming they help smokers quit. But amid the uncertainty, news about potential health dangers continues to trickle out. Jurisdictions including New York City and the state of Oklahoma have banned them in public places and state-owned property, respectively. E-cigarette makers lobbied the FDA for a new regulatory category that would separate the vapor products from tobacco products, officially disassociating e-cigarettes from their out-of-vogue predecessors. Assuming there aren’t any surprises about the health impacts of e-cigarettes, which experts say are less harmful than smoking tobacco, the FDA classification will be the dominant factor in where the devices get sold. ""We see electronic cigarettes as an anti-smoking product and we understand the pushback against combustible tobacco cigarettes,"" says Jeff Holman, president of Vapor Corp., a publicly traded e-cigarette company whose products are already on shelves in Family Dollar, Dollar General, and Rite Aid. ""Ultimately, we are hopeful that our product category will benefit from this trend away from tobacco.""",0.3990490312362952,0.6009509687637048,0.8640740507248873,820,5.4439024390243906,437,6.5354691075514877,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

In the decision, Federal District Court judge Lee Rosenthal writes that ""T-Mobile has shown a likelihood that potential customers will be confused into thinking that Aio is affiliated or associated with T-Mobile based on the confused association between Aio’s use of its plum color and T-Mobile’s similar use of its similar magenta color."" The opinion preliminarily prohibits Aio Wireless from using its plum color in advertising, marketing, and store design. Aio Wireless is a low-cost, no-contract carrier owned and operated by AT&T. The prepaid service launched last year, but T-Mobile filed a lawsuit against the company immediately. In the complaint, T-Mobile argued that Aio's plum color scheme and similar wireless services confused customers into thinking that the low-cost carrier was associated with T-Mobile. Winning a preliminary injunction requires a strong case, as T-Mobile had to prove that it had a strong likelihood of success in the final case. Considering the likelihood that Aio was infringing — and the damages that the infringement was causing to T-Mobile — the court decided that it should stop Aio from continuing to use its shade of plum. A final ruling is yet to come, and issues such as monetary damages will be decided later. ""T-Mobile’s time, effort, and expense exerted to create and define its brand has been unfairly exploited."" Part of T-Mobile's argument was that ""AT&T set up Aio to compete directly with T-Mobile,"" and the court agrees with that claim, saying that ""the record is clear that Aio wanted to capture T-Mobile customers."" Some documents unearthed during the case reveal that AT&T knew Aio's color scheme was similar to T-Mobile's. According to the opinion, a company hired by AT&T for focus group testing sent a report ""highlighting that because the plum color was so similar to T-Mobile magenta, focus-group members were initially confused into thinking that the commercials were affiliated with T-Mobile."" T-Mobile has staunchly defended its trademark on its magenta color before, and in a statement, the company says that this latest ruling ""validates T-Mobile's position that wireless customers identify T-Mobile with magenta and that T-Mobile's use of magenta is protected by trademark law.""  One point of contention in the case was that Aio doesn't use the exact same color as T-Mobile; the former's is a bit more plum than magenta. The court had little issue with the differences in color, deciding that the color and services offered by Aio were similar enough to cause confusion. However, the preliminary injunction is limited to only one shade of plum. The decision specifically says that the injunction blocks Aio from using ""large blocks or swaths of Pantone 676C and confusingly similar shades in its advertising, marketing, and store design."" The court specifically says that the ruling ""does not require Aio to abandon all uses of plum"" — just the particular color Pantone 676C and similar shades. Matt Macari contributed to this report.

The cost-cutting is in line with CEO and president Kaz Hirai's outlined plan to streamline Sony's offerings, and other parts of the company had better news to report. The games division saw a 64.6 percent boost in sales over last year, thanks to the PlayStation 4's strong launch and a weakened yen. Sony's mobile products and communications division, which included PCs until now, saw revenue increase 44.8 percent year-on-year powered by a ""significant increase in unit sales of smartphones."" The home entertainment and sound division saw a 24.8 percent lift in revenue on improved LCD TV sales; Sony is now splitting off its TV business as a subsidiary and will concentrate on high-end and 4K models. 'Breaking Bad' lifts entertainment revenue The entertainment business, which has come under scrutiny over the past year, showed a 7.1 percent increase in revenue but a 4.3 percent drop in operating income. Sony called out Breaking Bad home and streaming sales as a driver of revenue for Television Productions, and Captain Phillips and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 recorded strong box-office performance, but overall the movie division couldn't match the impact of Skyfall from the same period last year. Update: Although Sony is spinning its TV division into a separate unit, it's unlikely to go the way of VAIO for the time being.

The process lets companies keep financial details private until a few weeks before their shares begin public trading, and is the same route pursued by Twitter. Confidential IPOs are a relatively recent phenomena, enabled by new rules from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) designed to make the IPO process cheaper and more manageable and to encourage smaller firms to make the move into public markets.  GoPro last raised  $200 million in private funding from Foxconn in December, 2012. That round reportedly valued the company at $2.5 billion, so the IPO would be expected to value the company at several times that figure. Last year, the company did $521 million in gross sales and said it was profitable. It also expects to nearly double revenue this year. GoPro's story could hardly be more picture perfect for a young hardware startup: the idea was born after founder and current CEO Nick Woodman took a surfing tour in 2002. He wanted to be able to film action shots of himself without spending the money to hire a whole camera crew. So he bootstrapped the initial private capital and built the hardware himself. The first unit was sold in 2004.   GoPro now has its own editing software, but currently makes most of its revenue selling cameras.

It was 10.6 bitcoins held in the wallet service Coinbase, the most well-funded and widely implemented service on the market. Jeff, who asked that we not use his last name, got the news of the transaction as soon as it happened, and after going back and forth with a customer-service representative, he had his money refunded. Exactly one month later, it happened again. Coinbase told him he'd been hacked This time, the news came while he was at the hospital for the birth of his daughter. He hurried to unlink his checking account, only to see a new purchase for $7,000 worth of bitcoins had just cleared. He quickly moved the new money out of Coinbase, dropping it in a secure offline wallet where the hackers couldn't reach it. He'd saved the $7,000 from being stolen, but his original 10.6 bitcoins were now gone for good. Coinbase told him he'd been hacked, and didn't qualify for a second refund. It's part of a string of Bitcoin thefts that have hit the service in recent weeks. The Verge has confirmed two other Coinbase users with stories similar to Jeff's, one taken for $16,000 and another for $5,000. In the first case, the victim was using two-factor authentication and received a refund; in the second, two-factor hadn’t been enabled and the refund was denied, on grounds that the user hadn’t properly set up the account’s security measures. Several other as-yet-unverified reports have also been posted on the Coinbase subreddit. The Verge has confirmed two other Coinbase users with similar stories Researchers from the security firm FireEye say the relatively small scope of the breaches makes it unlikely that Coinbase had a service-wide vulnerability. Instead, the researchers suggested that Jeff and others had been individually compromised, but that Coinbase's unusually powerful API key made them more vulnerable after the attack had taken place. Used to let third-party apps access Coinbase accounts, the right API key will let any program move bitcoins in and out of a given accounts. Once the key is compromised, attackers can even access linked bank accounts to purchase more bitcoins. Users are advised not to authorize the API key if they don't need it, but if an account has been compromised, hackers may decide to authorize it themselves, as Jeff suspects happened to him. The small scope of the breaches makes a service-wide vulnerability unlikely Reached for comment, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed that some users had experienced attacks, but emphasized the individual nature of the breaches, saying, ""phishing is something that's ongoing. It happens on every major site on the internet."" Armstrong also pointed out Coinbase's use of two-factor authentication, a feature that's still missing from many major banking sites. The FireEye researchers agreed: none of these attacks seem to be targeting Coinbase’s own infrastructure. Every indication suggests they are individual exploits targeting individual accounts, and Coinbase’s own user agreement clearly states that users are ""responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access Coinbase services."" For one reason or another, Jeff and the other customers failed to do that. Still, amid real financial losses, it’s easy to see why they feel betrayed. Any program with the proper API key is able to make its own transactions In Jeff’s case, the API key was almost certainly at fault. He says he reset the key and disabled it after the first hack, only to find it reenabled by hackers the next time he logged on. A day after Jeff's second hack, Coinbase enabled two-factor authentication via email for anyone attempting to turn on the API key, a change that might have prevented Jeff's losses — but by then it was too late. Even now, any program with the proper key is able to make its own transactions without further authentication. The attacks come at a critical time for Coinbase, an the Andreessen Horowitz-backed company that has become the Bitcoin market’s largest and most reputable broker in recent months. In January, the company partnered with Overstock.com to handle Bitcoin transactions for the site, the largest retail implementation the currency has ever seen. Smaller sites like BloomNation, Malwarebytes, and payment-tracker Mint signed on with Coinbase shortly after. At the same time, the company has often been the target of phishing schemes, particularly after public user transaction records were discovered this past April. In response to The Verge's report, Coinbase published a blog post this morning that specifically warns against phishing schemes, instructing users to ""avoid clicking on suspicious or unknown URLs."" ""It was just too easy for someone with the key to take all the funds out of the account."" Much of the blame also lies with the basic structural properties of Bitcoin, which make it impossible to reverse transactions and easy to launder money once it's been stolen. If the same hackers tried to transfer funds from a traditional bank account, the account owner could have a small but crucial window in which to stop the payment, and preemptive antifraud measures could halt the transaction before it took place. Because of the network's open and pseudonymous nature, those protections are extremely difficult to implement in the Bitcoin marketplace. For his part, Jeff blames the API key and the promises of ""bank level security"" made on the company's website, a promise Armstrong says he stands by. ""It was too easy for someone with the key to take all the funds out of the account,"" Jeff says of the API key. He wishes the option to enable had been less accessible, more hidden. ""I wish it had just never been there."" It's particularly galling to him because the key is a developer-level feature that most consumers have no use for. For Jeff, that extra bit of third-party access came with a hefty price tag. As he put it, ""I'm just a dude that wants to buy some shit from Overstock.""",0.37441098683044577,0.6255890131695543,0.8220589206187205,1005,5.080597014925373,505,6.2475247524752477,0,0,"Business, Web, Exclusive, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Every student at participating schools will receive an iPad, with teachers and administrators also given Macs and Apple TV set-top boxes for classroom use. ""A lack of equal access to technology and knowledge puts entire communities and populations of students at a disadvantage, especially minorities,"" reads the new site outlining Apple's contribution. ""We want to do our part to change this."" Apple says its pledge, which the White House described in February as ""an unprecedented commitment for the company,"" as an ""important first step"" in advancing the cause of modern technology in every classroom. During a speech at the Alabama state capitol today, CEO Tim Cook touched on the subject.  ""Education is a fundamental human right for everyone,"" Cook said.  And with that first step, Apple is focusing on schools that are struggling to provide students and communities with the technology that others might take for granted. At the locations Apple has picked, at least 96 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. The company also notes that 92 percent of students at partner schools are of Hispanic, Black, Native American, Alaskan Native, or Asian heritage. ""Despite their economic challenges, these schools share a vision of what their students’ lives would be like with Apple technology,"" Apple says. Here's how Apple's grants map out across the country; a full list of schools is also available.   Apple wants to see things through with its pledge to ConnectED, and that extends beyond simply passing its products around.

Dr. Alan Eustace, whose official title is Senior Vice President of Knowledge, successfully completed a jump from 135,908 feet. The accomplishment came seemingly out of nowhere with no fanfare or media buzz whatsoever; The New York Times' science Twitter account first reported Eustace's incredible feat. Early this morning, Eustace began his balloon-powered ascent from an abandoned runway in Roswell, New Mexico, according to the Times. He was wearing a custom-designed spacesuit that featured an ""elaborate"" life support system in case anything went wrong during the plunge. The trip up took two hours; he fell back to earth in only 15 minutes with peak speeds exceeding 800 miles per hour; spectators report hearing a sonic boom as Eustace raced through the sky. The last time someone made a leap like this, the entire world knew about it; Felix Baumgartner's thrilling jump from the edge of space was streamed live over the internet as it happened. Baumgartner became the first person to break the sound barrier in free fall. His dive was from an altitude of 127,852 feet, which at the time also set a new record for highest free-fall parachute jump — a record that Eustace surpassed today. Eustace apparently declined Google's offers to help, seeking to avoid the spectacle and frenzy that surrounded Baumgartner's jump. Instead, he worked quietly for three years on the self-funded project — outside of Google's halls — to make his mark and shatter the altitude record by falling from the stratosphere. Paragon Space Development Corporation helped develop a life support system that allowed Eustace to breathe in pure oxygen during his long journey up and quick drop down.

The Federal Trade Commission is suing AT&T because the second-largest US carrier throttles speeds of its unlimited data customers, a policy that the FTC describes as ""deceptive"" and ""unfair."" In a press release, the FTC said AT&T has ""misled millions of its smartphone customers"" by slowing down their data speeds after they've used up a certain amount of data in a single month. AT&T has failed to make its throttling policies clear enough, according to the complaint. ""The issue here is simple: ‘unlimited’ means unlimited,"" said FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez. The Commission's filing blasts AT&T for slowing customers down to the point where common tasks — watching video, streaming music, etc. — become ""difficult or nearly impossible."" Lesson to mobile companies from FTC’s 1st data throttling case: If u promise unlimited data, ur on hook to deliver: http://t.co/Q29FL8Am2V AT&T no longer offers unlimited data plans; the carrier began slowing down speeds for heavy data users in 2011 — and it's throttled a whole lot of people since then. 3.5 million unique customers have had speeds slowed more than 25 million times, per the FTC's numbers. AT&T has drawn thousands of complaints over the policy from consumers who feel unlimited data should continue to be free of restrictions. Those complaints have been sent to the FTC, FCC, Better Business Bureau, and AT&T itself. AT&T is by no means alone in slowing down those on unlimited plans, but clearly the FTC isn't happy with how the carrier has handled things in recent years. Today's press release says the FTC worked closely with the FCC in piecing together the complaint. In response, AT&T offered the following, strongly-worded statement: The FTC’s allegations are baseless and have nothing to do with the substance of our network management program. It’s baffling as to why the FTC would choose to take this action against a company that, like all major wireless providers, manages its network resources to provide the best possible service to all customers, and does it in a way that is fully transparent and consistent with the law and our contracts.   We have been completely transparent with customers since the very beginning. We informed all unlimited data-plan customers via bill notices and a national press release that resulted in nearly 2,000 news stories, well before the program was implemented.  In addition, this program has affected only about 3% of our customers, and before any customer is affected, they are also notified by text message. This lawsuit could prove to be a major headache for AT&T; the FTC tends to be aggressive in seeing these battles through to some sort of settlement. The Commission is often successful in its challenges, but it's too early to know what an end result here would look like. Customers would obviously like to see AT&T reverse its decision to throttle unlimited data customers. That would put those people on equal footing with grandfathered unlimited customers at Verizon Wireless, who enjoy no restrictions on LTE data speeds. But other possibilities include AT&T paying a fine or refunding affected customers.

Last night, the 33-year-old doctor was confirmed as New York's first case of Ebola. In the hours since, detectives and reporters have pored over every detail of his seven days in New York. We know where he lives, where he ate dinner the night before he was hospitalized, where he went bowling, and the brand of car service that brought him home. Some of this information is coming directly from Spencer himself, who's cooperating from a quarantined sickbed at Bellevue Hospital — but if there's anything he forgot, it's easy to fill in the gaps. There are credit card records, which are easily and quickly pulled. His Metrocard tells us he rode three different subway lines on Wednesday, the A, L and 1 trains. The same day, he ran three miles across the High Line city park, which has surveillance cameras monitoring each entrance. Once he was back in New York, nearly everything he did left a trail. The more we know, the more we feel the panic of what we don't know There's a real reason for the obsessive attention: staying ahead of the virus. This morning, the CDC was staking out Spencer's apartment on 145th Street, telling neighbors the important facts about Ebola, in an attempt to quell panic. What we know so far is mostly good news: all of Spencer's symptoms happened inside his now-quarantined apartment, which suggests he was rarely contagious outside of it, and all four of the people he came in contact with have been cleared. But it doesn't make us feel good. The more we know, the more we feel the panic of what we don't know. That's how surveillance works. You learn what you can, but it only magnifies the significance of what you can't quite see. We don’t — and can't — know what was happening inside Spencer's body during those seven days, or the exact moment he became symptomatic enough to spread the virus. We can't know every bodily fluid he left behind. You can try to put in perspective,  but that’s not how fear works. The risk of transmission is small, but our fears and our knowledge magnify it. Every new fact brings the panic closer to the surface. After PRISM, people talk about total surveillance — how oppressive it is when everything you do or say is recorded — but that's not the only risk. What’s more concerning is that our rush to collect more and more data will build up the same panic of powerlessness, the panic of not knowing enough. A whiff of interest — a half-suspicious email, say — will build up a frenzy of collection, with each piece seeming to point to a damning piece of evidence that's just out of reach. Which is how we end up with a humanitarian doctor as the most watched man in New York. The bowling alley Spencer went to is shut down now. It’s unclear when they’ll reopen. A man who went bowling there on Wednesday says he’s freaking out. He might have been there at the same time as Spencer? Maybe? He high-fived a few people and shared a piece of pie with a stranger. If only there’d been more cameras! All he really knows is that he was in the same building on the same night.

To break through that anonymity, agents had to get creative — but new documents suggest that in catching the culprit, the FBI may have committed a crime of its own. Documents uncovered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation show that the FBI created a fake web page designed to look like a Seattle Times article, and used the page to spread tracking malware onto the suspect's computer. Creating dummy pages is a common way to spread malware — typically known as spoofing — but it's more common among criminals than law enforcement, and many are already interpreting the fake page as an attack on the press.

""Not only does that cross a line, it erases it."" The Associated Press echoed the concern, saying, ""this ploy violated AP’s name and undermined AP’s credibility."" That the FBI impersonated a newspaper's website to deliver malware to a target is outrageous. Over the top crazy.  Called CIPAV, the FBI's spyware tool is designed to harvest a computer's IP address, MAC address, and most recent session login — effectively identifying the person who visited the page. In this case, agents sent a message to the suspect's Myspace page, containing a link to the dummy article. Once the suspect clicked on the link, the page covertly uploaded CIPAV to the suspect's computer, leading agents back to the person running the page. But there's still a lot of secrecy surrounding the CIPAV tool, particularly the bureau's protocols for deploying the spyware.

Because they're not right now. That's because the US Federal Election Commission (FEC), the agency in charge of regulating campaign financing in this country, decided back in 2006 to exempt people who post politically opinionated material online from having to file reports on how much they spent to create their content and from having to post detailed disclaimers saying who was paying for it. Meanwhile, the people and groups who make political ads for TV that cost over $10,000 must file expenditure reports and run audio disclaimers over their ads. This is how the so-called ""internet exemption"" was born, and nonprofit groups have been taking advantage of it ever since to post political ads online without disclosing who exactly paid for them, let alone how much they cost. Now some of the FEC's leaders are saying that the internet exemption was a mistake, specifically when it comes to online video ads: last week, the three Democratic commissioners in charge of the agency voted in favor of investigating a nonprofit organization called the Checks and Balances for Economic Growth, The Hill reports. Checks and Balances For Economic Growth produced two video ads that were posted on YouTube during the 2012 campaign — ads that railed against President Obama and Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, respectively (see them below). The group was accused of airing the ads on broadcast TV in Ohio, spending over $800,000 on them, and not including full audio disclaimers.  ""As nearly everyone now knows, you can watch TV on the Internet,"" wrote Democratic commissioner Ann Ravel in a statement. ""So why hasn't the [Federal Election] Commission re-evaluated its approach to keep up with the changing times?""   However, Checks and Balances for Economic Growth responded saying that it spent the money in question on a third ad on TV and that the two ads posted to YouTube were never aired on TV (despite having ""TV ad"" in their names on YouTube).

As it turns out, the USPS has also been quietly spying on way more of the mail passing through its doors than previously acknowledged. A report from the agency's internal watchdog — the USPS Office of Inspector General (OIG) — found that USPS captured information from the outside of about 49,000 pieces of consumer mail in 2013 and turned much of it over to law enforcement organizations throughout the country, unbeknownst to the intended senders and recipients. This information reportedly did not include the contents of letters and packages, but rather was limited to the information appearing only on the exterior, such as names, addresses, and postmark dates. The report on the USPS information capturing program, called ""mail covers,"" was initially published to little fanfare over the summer and subsequently reported on by Politico, but is getting more attention now with an article appearing today in The New York Times that includes additional details.  ""information from a mail cover often provides valuable investigative leads."" First some background: the mail covers program is hardly new, it's been in existence for over a hundred years, as The Times notes. It's also not as invasive as a full search warrant for the contents of mail, which the USPS also grants (although only for federal search warrants; state search warrants aren't accepted by the agency). In a guide for law enforcement agencies, the USPS explains exactly how the program works: a police officer/law enforcement agent needs to be already conducting an investigation into a suspected felony and have the names and addresses for their intended surveillance targets. The officer must send this information to the USPS through the mail or provide it verbally (in person or over the phone), along with a reason why the mail cover is needed. Then the USPS will begin capturing the information from the exterior of all the targets' incoming and outgoing mail for up to 30 days (although extensions are available). The USPS says that ""information from a mail cover often provides valuable investigative leads,"" but adds that it ""is confidential and should be restricted to those persons who are participating in the investigation."" However, as the OIG report found, there are numerous problems with the way the USPS has been running the mail covers program. For starters, the USPS has a mail cover app that apparently doesn't work very well and is blamed for the agency continuing to capture information from the mail of 928 targets even after the surveillance period was supposed to have ended. The USPS also appears to have started mail cover surveillance on targets without sufficient justification from law enforcement as to why it was needed, and some USPS employees didn't even keep the written justification on file like they were supposed to. And in a further failure of duty, several mail covers weren't started on time. Perhaps most troubling of all, the USPS doesn't appear to have been accurately reporting the total number of mail covers in its official records provided to the Times under Freedom of Information Act requests, which show only 100,000 total requests for mail surveillance between 2001 and 2012 (an average of 8,000 a year, way fewer than the 49,000 mail covers acknowledged in the OIG report). The USPS said it agreed with the findings of the OIG report and would work to implement changes, but for an agency already struggling with how to move into the future, the findings are hardly good news.",0.5767345483368267,0.4232654516631733,0.8523951995369347,637,5.0361067503924648,324,6.1728395061728394,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Now a startup company is hoping to track police shootings more closely for both the sake of the officers and the wider public. The company, Yardarm, has developed a sensor that fits in the base of a police officer's Glock sidearm, which records not only every time the gun is fired, but other potentially revealing information including location, the direction the weapon was pointed when fired, and when exactly it was unholstered. The encrypted data is then sent wirelessly to a mobile app in realtime, where other officers and commanders can access it, allowing them to respond if an officer is in trouble. Yardarm announced last week that it has just begun field trials of the technology with the Sheriff's Department of Santa Cruz, California, and the Carrollton, Texas Police Department. It will also be demoing the tech this week at a police conference in Orlando, Florida.  Yardam was founded in the wake of the horrific 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shootings and initially its founders wanted to make a consumer smart gun that could be remotely disabled, but abandoned those plans because of resistance from gun owners and gun rights advocates, the Huffington Post notes. Whether Yardarm's sensors — reportedly inspired by electronic luggage trackers — catch on with police departments or not, it's worth pointing out that the data they record can't answer some key questions about police encounters, such as what transpired before a gun was unholstered, why in particular it was drawn, and whether police or suspects tried to de-escalate the situation before resorting to deadly force. It's unclear whether anyone besides police departments — defense attorneys, for example — would have access to the data and under what conditions. The knowledge that a police officer's sidearm is being tracked could also give some officers pause before pointing their weapons, for better or worse. At the same time, Yardarm's data could provide greater objective detail about a police shooting than is available now, and the company is but one of many seeking to provide police departments with more advanced officer tracking products.",0.5623716760978843,0.4376283239021157,0.851962261996829,395,5.2050632911392407,245,6.0857142857142854,0,0,"Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

But gorgeous as it may be, a fan-made poster manages to improve upon it — for at least a few frames. Artists Zachary Johnson and Ronen V put together a poster that animates scenes from the Mad Max trailer with oil paintings. Their style brings the brief animations alive in an incredible way, filling each frame with a ton of motion and a surprising amount of detail. The way each painting bleeds over the edge of its frame is a wonderful touch that definitely falls in line with the Mad Max vibe. There's no way this look would make sense for the entirety of Mad Max, but it's hard not to wonder what it would be like to watch an entire film this way. Fortunately, Johnson happens to have made already a five-minute-long music video out of oil paintings. It took over 3,400 paintings in total, and it's a pretty incredible sight.  As for what an actual feature would look like this way? It seems pretty unlikely that we'd ever get to see one — even hand-drawn animation is becoming too costly and time consuming for most studios these days.

Hundreds of costumed fans have gathered outside the arena here in Vienna, waving flags under a late afternoon sun, and singing along to the bubbly Europop blaring from huge loudspeakers. Backstage, Philip can’t hear them, but he will soon.     In the halls, things are building to a crescendo. A bearded drag queen fans herself furiously in one corridor, pausing only to adjust her black flamenco dress and pose for photos. Smiling, musclebound men prance around in the press hall, hoisting signs that read “Free Hugs!” But nobody takes them up on their offer — they’re too busy setting up cameras and doing sound checks, and prepping for the event that’s going to change Philip’s life.     In barely three hours, he and the three other members of the Danish boy band Anti Social Media will take the stage at the Eurovision Song Contest, one of the biggest — and most ridiculous — TV events in the world, and sing their official competition song, ""The Way You Are."" Six months ago, he was just a redheaded 19-year-old with a nice voice. By the end of the night, millions of viewers around the world will know his face and his band’s music. For the moment, though, all he can do is wait.        “It’s like a roller coaster, you know, when you’re going up.” Philip says, sandwiched on a couch between drummer Emil Vessing and bassist David Vang, both of them struggling to contain their nervous excitement. That sounds terrifying, I tell him. “Oh yeah?” he replies. “I dunno, I like it.”    Where three minutes can at once mean everything and absolutely nothing The last five months have been one continual ascent for Anti Social Media. Their producer, Lars ""Chief1"" Pedersen, brought them together in January solely to compete in tonight’s show — just for a chance at those three minutes on the world’s stage. If they win enough votes, they’ll stay on through Saturday night’s final, with a shot at bringing the Eurovision crown back to Denmark, a three-time champion. If they don’t, they’ll hop on a plane and resume their fledgling careers in Copenhagen, where the response could be brutal. ""If we flop and go back to Denmark, people go like, ‘Boo! Boo!’"" Chief1 told me last week. ""They will kill you."" What a final-round victory would mean for their careers remains less clear, but if it’s global fame and longevity they’re after, they may actually be better off losing — something even Chief1 acknowledges. Such is the cruel, twisted logic of Eurovision, where three minutes can at once mean everything and absolutely nothing. As an American who’s been living in Europe for seven years, there are many things I’ve embraced in the name of cultural assimilation — espresso, smoking, universal healthcare — but Eurovision has never been one of them. Maybe it’s because I never had a flag to get behind; maybe it’s because soaring ballads don’t really move my needle. But for everyone else here, Eurovision is an institution. According to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organizes Eurovision, more than more than 195 million people tuned in to watch last year’s semifinals and finals, putting it on par with the Super Bowl. What began as an experiment in live broadcasting technology with just seven countries has mutated into an extravagant, multimillion dollar production that now expands well beyond Europe’s borders. This year’s contest includes 40 entries from countries like Azerbaijan, Israel, and, for the first time, Australia. ""We don’t have a Super Bowl, we don’t have a World Series. We have Eurovision."" ""There are very few events in European culture that bring everyone together,"" says Ewan Spence, the gregarious, kilt-wearing founder of the Eurovision news website ESC Insight. ""We don’t have a Super Bowl, we don’t have a World Series. We have Eurovision."" The event celebrates its 60th anniversary this year in Vienna, continuing the tradition of anointing last year’s winner as the host country. Its epicenter is at the Wiener Stadthalle, a 10,000-seat indoor arena planted in a working-class corner of the city, along an impossibly wide boulevard peppered with sex shops and kebab stands. For nearly two weeks, members of the press and Eurovision fan blogs have been camping out in the Stadthalle, snapping selfies with their favorite artists and singing along with televised dress rehearsals.   For the uninitiated, American Idol may seem like the most obvious corollary to what Eurovision represents — a talent show determined by popular vote — but it’s much more than that. It’s equal parts Olympic event and geopolitical summit, mixed in with seizure-inducing stage sets and plenty of ""We are the World"" evangelism. Add in a baroque voting system, garish wardrobes, and often truly terrible songwriting, and the whole thing can seem like a circus of the absurd. But that’s what makes it so irresistible to so many. ""The best way to describe it is Miss Universe for music,"" says John Kennedy O’Connor, a Eurovision commentator and author of The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History. ""Miss Universe is nonsense — there’s no way that Miss Iceland is objectively more beautiful than Miss Canada. And that is the beauty of Eurovision. There’s no way you and I can sit down in a room and say this German song is better than that Austrian song."" Like Miss Universe, the degree to which theatrics and persona play into it partially explains why so few Eurovision winners have been able to translate their sudden fame into mainstream success. The qualities that the contest rewards — extravagance, flamboyance, general weirdness — often aren’t building blocks for global pop stardom (Russia notably made the finals in 2012 with a group of dancing grandmothers.) Whereas earlier competitions included future stars like ABBA (1974), Celine Dion (1988), and Julio Iglesias (1970), Eurovision’s more recent history is littered with names that have faded from the global stage and into oblivion. ""It’s like a supernova,"" says William Lee Adams, founder of the Eurovision blog Wiwibloggs. ""You kind of explode in all this glory, but then you’re a black hole and disappear. It’s a little depressing."" At first glance, that’s perhaps not surprising. Viewers vote for their favorite performance on a single night, not for ""most likely to succeed,"" and professional juries, which account for the other half of each country’s votes, are often swayed by politics. Not every act is looking for the same thing, either. This year’s entrants ranged from wide-eyed teens looking for their big break (Israel’s 16-year-old Nadav Guedj, for example) to grizzled, vaping baby boomers grasping at a second act (such as Montenegro’s 47-year-old Knez). ""What it delivers is instant fame that you can ride for as long as you can milk it."" But that still doesn’t explain why artists would actually put themselves through this ordeal — why they would devote so much time and energy to something that guarantees nothing more than the title ""Eurovision winner."" In an age of Vine moguls and Kardashians, fame has become increasingly up for interpretation, but the celebrity Eurovision confers upon its contestants seems to be a particularly ephemeral strain. The months leading up to the event typically entail a whirlwind of media appearances and photo ops, throughout which contestants  become packaged and product-developed, with compelling backstories and carefully manicured personas that will stay with them well beyond their three minutes onstage. Whether that’s a blessing or a curse depends on who you ask. ""I don’t think it gives you anything. I don’t think it possibly can,"" O’Connor says of winning Eurovision. ""What it delivers is instant fame that you can ride for as long as you can milk it, which isn’t very long. And nothing else."" Emil from Anti Social Media certainly has no illusions about the challenges that await his post-Eurovision career, and he’s surprisingly blunt about the burden that would come with the crown. ""It is a curse,"" says the 24-year-old drummer, from behind black Ray-Bans and a denim cap. It’s a muggy Wednesday in Vienna, and he’s lounging on a top-floor hotel balcony with the rest of Anti Social Media. They’re fresh off their first rehearsal at the Stadthalle and, just six days away from the biggest performance of their young lives, they seem remarkably relaxed, dropping fart jokes and ragging on each other. I suspect the small pyramid of empty beer cans in the corner of their hotel room may have something to do with it. ""We've talked about that a lot,"" adds David, the six-foot-something, square-jawed bassist who, at 25, is the closest thing the group has to an elder statesman. ""Our goal is not to be forgotten after this, like all the other contestants."" In many ways, Anti Social Media was genetically engineered for Eurovision success. Their sound and style is unabashedly Beatles-influenced, and after just three months, they seem to be maturing nicely into their roles. Emil is the group’s closest Ringo proxy, eccentric and outspoken; with his hushed tones, 19-year-old guitarist Nikolaj Tøth is George. Philip, the guitarist and frontman, is far more charismatic than any 19-year-old I’ve ever met, with sleepy eyes that seem destined for the walls of a pre-teen’s bedroom. They’ve each enjoyed varying levels of individual success as musicians, mostly through playing gigs across Denmark with their own bands. But they have aspirations that extend beyond their home country, and they think Eurovision could make them happen. ""You have this huge exposure,"" Philip says. ""We just look at that as a win no matter what."" Their sherpa through it all has been Chief1, a portly, easygoing 45-year-old who, from the right angle, looks a little like Peter Gallagher. Chief, as the band calls him, speaks with the casual authority of a guy who’s grown familiar with the Eurovision game. He created the rap group Rockers by Choice in the mid-1980s, and is regarded as a founding father of Denmark’s hip-hop scene. Anti Social Media is the third group he’s brought to Eurovision as a producer, and although he’s never gotten close to the title, he’s made a habit of backing groups that don’t fit the traditional Eurovision mold, eschewing the power ballads and duets for distinctly quirkier sounds — a rapper in 1997, and an acoustic pop singer he plucked off the streets of Copenhagen in 2012. Chief has taken a similar tack this year, betting on Anti Social Media’s Britpop aesthetic to stick out among a field of saccharine duets and anthemic club tracks. Compared to the dazzling, high-tech stage sets of most contestants this year, their routine is fairly austere: coordinated black-and-white blazers, carefully coiffed hairstyles, and doo-wop theatrics. ""I love Run DMC and I love the Beach Boys,"" Chief says. ""A lot of people would try to keep those two things separate."" Nearly everyone made a point of telling me just how non-Eurovision their song is Differentiation is key; nearly every artist I spoke with in Vienna last week made a point of telling me just how non-Eurovision their song is. Boggie, Hungary’s soft spoken, 23-year-old representative, says ""Wars for Nothing,"" her lilting (and at times soporific) anti-war ballad ""isn’t the most popular wave of music,"" but what really matters to her is the fact that she wrote it herself —  a dose of authenticity in a sea of pre-cooked singles. For Loïc, Belgium’s baby-faced hopeful, creative control is ""the reason why I live."" But underpinning all this individuality are somewhat banal messages that generally sound the same. ""I think it’s important to realize, OK, we are different, but inside we are all the same,"" Loïc says. ""We have blood and we have hearts that are beating."" That sounds an awful lot like Serbia’s entry — a 28-year-old soul singer named Bojana Stamenov, whose song includes the lyric: ""Finally I can say / I’m different and it’s OK."" There are also two different songs titled ""Warrior"" in this year’s field, and they both cover basically the same thematic ground: determination, resilience, etc. Part of that homogeneity could be attributed to a rule change, implemented in 1999, that allows contestants to sing in any language. That’s resulted in mostly English-language songs that aim for the broadest possible appeal. But this year’s field also seems to have taken a cue from last year’s winner: the bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst, who has become as celebrated for what she represents — tolerance, gay rights — as for her singing. The closest thing this year's contest has to a Conchita might be PKN, a veteran Finnish punk rock band whose four members have Down syndrome or autism. Leading up to Eurovision, they were widely included among the frontrunners to win the whole thing. ""The back story to many countries and many singers is now becoming as important as anything,"" O’Connor says. ""And I think as a result we’ve got a field of rather dull songs this year."" Anti Social Media don’t have a Conchita-esque backstory, and neither Chief nor the oddsmakers are optimistic about their chances. But that doesn’t seem to bother the group very much. They’ve already pushed out an EP since winning Denmark’s national competition in February, and will play shows across the country regardless of how they place. But Chief thinks Eurovision’s platform could — and probably should — deliver more than just steady work back home. The problem, in his view, is the Eurovision stigma. ""This could be such a huge window,"" he said last week, splayed out comfortably on a white leather couch backstage. ""But it seems like no one dares to do it because they also know that if you don’t get number one, then you’ll forever be banned from anything that’s remotely hip. So either it’s something for the debutante who couldn’t get into the hipster hip zone, or it’s the last stop for someone who was big once. And that’s kind of tragic for me."" But some Eurovision enthusiasts disagree. In their view, Eurovision provides the audience; what happens next is on the artist. ""You know in Mario Kart where you've got that little arrow on the ground that you go over and whoosh, you speed up for two seconds?"" Spence says. ""Eurovision is that little arrow. You get on it and whoosh. It’ll run out very quickly, but what you do with it is up to you."" It’s been one year since Suzy Guerra sang in her first Eurovision, and she’s still riding that arrow. She didn’t win the crown last year in Copenhagen. She didn’t even get past the semifinals. But the exposure provided was enough to kickstart a second career, and she’s embraced it with open arms. ""A lot of artists, after Eurovision, they don’t want to be related to Eurovision,"" she says. ""I don’t mind, and actually for me it’s mandatory, because it’s part of my path."" Suzy has spent the past year doing the Eurovision circuit, performing at corporate events, appearing on catwalks, and trying her hand at TV hosting. Before she decided to enter Portugal’s national contest at the last minute, she was working in the pharmaceutical industry in Dubai. Now, she’s supporting herself entirely on music and appearances — and for many ex-Eurovision singers, that’s more than enough. ""I think there’s often a perception that everyone’s goal is to become the next ABBA,"" says Adams, the Wiwibloggs founder. ""But no, people just wanna earn a living by singing, which is a fair enough goal."" Not everyone wants to be the next ABBA Suzy’s staying power as a musician has yet to be tested, though she’s not worried about being tagged with the Eurovision label for the rest of her career. She’s got a new single in the works, and she says it’s going to sound very different from ""Quero Ser Tua,"" the track she performed in front of the world last year. ""If the song is a hit, they won’t remember me as a Eurovision artist,"" she says. ""It’s not going to be Suzy the Eurovision artist, it’ll be Suzy that sings this song."" Doing that may be easier said than done. Sandie Shaw, who became the first Brit to win Eurovision in 1967, has blamed her victory for stunting her career, saying it saddled her with an ""uncool"" label and stifled her creative control. Gina G., who represented the UK in 1996, has made similarly disparaging comments about the event, saying it ""didn’t do me any favors afterwards."" And British singer-songwriter Rita Ora walked out of an audition to represent the UK in 2009, a decision she now credits with saving her career. ""It’s a double edged thing — that’s the reason why a lot of the winning songs are never heard of again,"" O’Connor says. ""They thrive in their pond, but then you put them in a completely different ocean and it’s a different story. They make no sense anymore.""   ""They didn't really see what we were about."" Even Eurovision success stories have their caveats. Lordi, a Finnish metal band that performs in monster costumes, enjoyed a surge in popularity and media coverage following their Eurovision victory in 2006, exposing them to entirely new fans, and catapulting them from niche curiosity to international phenomenon. Their lead singer, Tomi Petteri Putaansuu (stage name: Mr. Lordi), says that alone made Eurovision worthwhile, ""but on the other hand — and this is fucking strange — there are so many people all around the world, all around Finland, around Europe, who are using it as a weapon against us. That because we were at Eurovision, we could never ever be taken seriously ever again."" Their popularity also drew a much more mainstream demographic of fans, resulting in cultural collisions that the group wasn’t always comfortable with. Mr. Lordi points to one instance, not long after they won Eurovision, when he was heading to the dressing room after a show at an outdoor festival. Crowds of fans had gathered behind a fence separating them from the stage, and he stopped to sign some autographs. ""I have horns on my head, I have open bloody wounds on my face, I am all covered in sweat and shit and fake blood, and I’m carrying a bucket of severed limbs, and a fake chainsaw,"" he told me over the phone this week from his home in Rovaniemi, near the Arctic circle. ""And behind the fence there are like 100 people who are screaming and smiling at us, and there were grandmothers and like, five-year-olds. And I thought, ‘am I the only one here who sees that there’s something fucking wrong with this? Are these people blind?’ They only saw ‘whoo! Eurovision winners!’, and they didn't really see what we were about."" Lordi’s never going to reach ABBA levels of fame, and chances are that whoever wins this weekend won’t either. And in some ways, that doesn’t really matter. It certainly hasn’t hurt the show’s popularity, and it still offers an unmatched, singular platform that will continue to draw talent. But at what point do the glitz and superficiality begin to undermine its stakes? ""This is the problem with Eurovision — there’s ABBA, there’s Celine Dion, and who else?"" O’Connor says. ""After 60 years, if that’s all Eurovision can point to, then Eurovision has a credibility problem."" Similar problems have plagued smaller scale talent competitions as well, including the recently cancelled American Idol, a cultural juggernaut that made for compelling TV but ultimately produced few enduring pop stars. The contestants have no option but to take this seriously It’s easy for viewers to laugh Eurovision off as a celebration of the ludicrous and the flamboyant, and maybe that’s OK. But for the people behind the outrageous costumes and gaudy set designs, they have no option but to take this seriously. ""Music is too important to me to be sarcastic and ironic and something to be laughed about,"" Chief told me. He says he hasn’t decided whether he’ll make another run at Eurovision next year, but listening to him speak, I get the impression that this is it for him. ""I haven’t spent my entire life, 24/7 to make songs and have people say ‘wow, that’s a really red dress’, or ‘why are there old ladies and strippers onstage?’"" Anti Social Media is nearly finished with their three minutes on stage when the skies suddenly open above Vienna, and a clap of thunder sends journalists scurrying away from the smoking patio and back into the press room. The scene inside now looks like a human Risk board, with bloggers and journalists draped in their national flags, breathlessly watching the broadcast on giant TV screens. The nervous cynicism and ""everyone’s a winner"" rhetoric I’d heard for a week is fading away, replaced with a more primal urge: to survive, even for just a few more days. The performances draw to a close around 10:30, thus beginning a painfully long 20 minutes of vote counting. The broadcasters fill the time with flashback montages and an inexplicable clip of Vienna’s tourist attractions, which are shot with a GoPro strapped to stuffed cats and dogs. Then, a little before 11 PM, our multilingual emcees announce that the votes are in. The countdown begins. Albania is the first to make it, followed by Armenia, Russia, and Romania. Hungary is the fifth winner announced, and the camera cuts to Boggie, who immediately embraces her team in an explosion of joy. The tension mounts as they begin reading off the final five winners, each name triggering a burst of applause in one corner of the press room and a wave of gasps everywhere else. In these waning moments, the show that everyone loves to ridicule suddenly means everything. Belgium's Loïc is the last finalist announced. Denmark is not called. ""Hey, it’s a competition. What can you do?"" At around 11:30 PM, with the dust settled and journalists now back in front of their computers, Anti Social Media re-emerges from the green room and strolls across the press area for a round of interviews with Danish TV. Philip is leading the way, followed by his bandmates, backup singers, and a small entourage of handlers. His eyes are red and puffy, and he discretely rubs the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger. For the first time all week, he actually seems like a 19-year-old. The group pauses in front of the table where I’m sitting, and I catch Emil’s eye. He reaches out over the shoulders of his entourage to shake my hand, and I clumsily offer my condolences. He responds with a smile and a shrug. ""Hey, it’s a competition,"" he says. ""What can you do?"" A few seconds later, the band arrives in front of a TV camera and a Danish presenter in a green sequined blazer. They’re about to go on air when the band’s media handler turns to Philip and raises her eyebrows. They both jump up and down twice, like boxers getting ready for a fight, and his shoulders heave with a sigh. Then the lights come on, he flashes a smile, and the rest of his career begins.

Netflix will be continuing to blow it out with original programming, releasing the latest season of Orange is the New Black, the first season of Sense8 — its new sci-fi show from the creators of The Matrix — and the documentary What Happened, Miss Simone? It will also become home to a host of other films and TV shows, including one of our favorites from this year's Sundance Film Festival: the sci-fi movie Advantageous. It will also be losing several favorites over the course of the month, with films like Taxi Driver and Silence of the Lambs departing the service.

The finished product made it into this year's Cannes Film Festival, and Sandberg is currently shopping a feature-length version of the project as well.

Arnott discovered the quirk when hundreds of family photos appeared on Google Photos, even when he'd deleted the pictures and uninstalled the app itself from his phone. Rather than using its own settings menu to determine backups, Google Photos uses Android's centralized Google settings menu. If you choose to automatically upload new pictures to the cloud when installing the Google Photos app, those settings will live on even after the app is wiped from your phone. To turn it off, hit ""Google Photo Backup"" in your phone's menu and change the option. Turn off photo backup in your phone's Google Settings menu Arnott says he chose to pass on Google Photos because he was already sharing several Flickr accounts with his parents and didn't want them to have to learn new methods of accessing images, but others may choose to avoid it over questions of security. Google Photos uses supposedly ""unguessable"" public URLs for its images, a system that has scared some users, but one that Aravind Krishnaswamy, an engineering lead on Google Photos assures us is safe and actually ""much harder to guess than your password."" Still, discovering that a service you apparently rejected is somehow collating his most precious moments without his knowledge was a shock for Arnott, who writes that he rushed to his computer ""in a semi-panic"" to find pages of photos of his wife and daughter.

Since splitting the messaging service away from its main app last April, the company has been developing Messenger into a fully-fledged platform to rival Asian services like WeChat and LINE, apps that combine commerce and gaming with chatting. In recent months, Facebook has added video calling and a payments service to Messenger, as well as launching a version for the app for web browsers.

Just like Google's service, this isn't available to everyone; Comcast says you ""must generally live within a third of a mile of our fiber network"" in eligible cities to receive Gigabit Pro. The below map shows where that fiber network extends so far.   That's not where costs end, though. Comcast's fine print for Gigabit Pro notes that customers must sign a two-year contract to receive service, and (significant) early termination fees apply if you decide 2Gbps is overkill. And then there's this:   So you're potentially looking at an installation window of two months, and while the ""up to"" language gives Comcast wiggle room, some people could pay $1,000 before they've even used Gigabit Pro. Google also charges ""construction fees"" — usually $300 — for Fiber customers who opt for its most basic internet tier. But the fee is waived if you're on the more popular 1Gbps internet plan or an internet / Fiber TV bundle. Gigabit Pro cannot yet be bundled with other Comcast services. On the plus side, Comcast is offering people who agree to that two-year contract an early promotional rate of $159 per month, according to DSL Reports. That makes the whole thing slightly easier to swallow. And if you're the type of person who can afford $300 internet every month, maybe the tacked on installation costs won't influence your thinking much anyway.

Parted from the atmosphere through cosmic radiation, most pass through the earth like ghosts, never being detected. But occasionally, a handful will bounce off a substance, and as the New York Times reports today, that could be the key to safely looking inside the ruined nuclear reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi Power Plant. It's still too dangerous to send workers inside Fukushima's reactors It's still too dangerous to send workers inside Fukushima's reactors; even enlisting a camera could result in another radiation leak. The full extent of the damage, even more than three years later, isn't known. That's where the muons come in. When the particles ricochet off a material, specifically an atomic nucleus, the direction they turn can be tracked through a process called muon tomography. Key for cleanup work, the technique can suss out radioactive material from other materials, even through feet of steel, giving workers precious data about the density and shape of what's inside the reactors. Toshiba, currently tasked with running the cleanup, is expected to soon ink a deal with the Los Alamos National Laboratory to procure equipment for the project, according to the Times. Muon tomography isn't new; it's in use today, and has been since the 1960s, although image definition has improved in that time. In fact, rather than sacrifice quality for efficiency, cleanup workers will spend weeks at single sites outside the walls of the Fukushima complex, slowly gathering information from the muons they catch in the act. Out of the 10,000 that bombard a square meter every minute, only a few may bounce away. The project is expected to begin testing later this year, with full images produced next year.

Three times the volume of the oceans on Earth's surface The team, led by mineralogist Steven Jacobsen, used an array of 2000 seismometers to study how seismic waves generated by earthquakes move through the Earth's interior. The waves' speed changed depending on the type of rock they pass through, and wet ringwoodite has a particular effect on wave velocity. Jacobsen was able to reproduce wet ringwoodite in his lab, and the group's findings matched what he observed in the lab. As it turns out, ringwoodite, under the extreme heat and pressure of the mantle, bleeds water. That water would then become trapped in the transition zone at between roughly 200 and 400 miles underground. The new research lends credence to theories that our oceans originated on Earth.

A well-known diabetes pill called Metformin, for instance, is now being used to treat certain cancers. And Thalidomide, a drug used as a sedative in the ’50s, is now used to treat leprosy and bone marrow cancer. But a new study published today in Translational Psychiatry might beat these examples, as it reveals that suramin, a drug that was developed in 1916 to treat African sleeping sickness, can restore normal social behaviors in adult mouse models of autism. These results won't lead to new autism therapies right away — suramin has not been tested on humans with autism, and it's actually toxic if dispensed for longer than a few months — they do hint at the new directions that researchers might explore. The mice became more social after a single dose In the study, researchers administered a dose of suramin to 25 male mice, whereas another 25 males received a saline injection instead. All mice were ""maternal immune activation mouse models,"" meaning animals that exhibit autism-like behaviors following a virus infection in their mothers during pregnancy. This single dose, the researchers report, corrected the social behaviors seen in autism spectrum disorder. The mice, for instance, spent more time interacting with both mice and objects they had never interacted with before, compared to those injected with a saline solution. The benefits lasted for five weeks after the drug was washed out of their system. The scientists think suramin acts by binding to, and inhibiting, 19 different receptors — called ""purinergic"" receptors — that are expressed on every cell type in the body. This binding action prevents ATP, our body's energetic currency unit, from binding to these specific receptors, which then helps turn off a cellular response known as the ""cell danger response."" The cell danger response can change the trajectory of neurodevelopment ""The cell danger response is an evolutionarily conserved set of about 30 metabolic changes that help protect cells from threat,"" explained Robert Naviaux, a geneticist at the University of California San Diego and lead author of the study, in an email to The Verge. These metabolic changes can be beneficial, because they allow the re-allocation of energetic resources in times of stress, like when the body encounters viruses, pollutants, or even certain drugs. But ""when significant exposures happen during pregnancy or in early childhood,"" Naviaux said, ""the trajectory of neurodevelopment can be changed."" Moreover, ""cells retain a metabolic memory of these significant exposures according to the severity of the stress and the developmental timing of the exposure."" So, if the change in resource allocation is severe enough, it may also alter normal cellular functions that are required for healthy neurodevelopment. And suramin's binding action seems to reverse this change in function by allowing cells to return to their normal metabolism, Naviaux said — ""and their normal jobs."" Suramin is toxic in the long-run Unfortunately, suramin can't be administered for longer than a few months because of long-term toxicity. Naviaux thinks people shouldn't focus on that aspect of the study, however, because scientist may one day find less damaging drugs that have similar effects. These therapies could be given ""only once or intermittently,"" he says, to unblock metabolism and restore more normal social behaviors. ""This really takes a novel approach to understanding what's going on in autism,"" says Richard Frye, director of autism research at the University of Arkansas who did not participate in the study. ""I think the argument that, when a cell senses danger, it changes its metabolism to protect itself makes a lot of sense — and it makes a lot of sense with what we see in autism."" ""it makes a lot of sense with what we see in autism."" But other researchers are less enthusiastic. ""[The findings] are valuable, but the main problem is that they rely on a model of immune infection, not a genuine model of autism,"" said Yehezkel Ben-Ari, an autism researcher at the Mediterranean Institute of Neurobiology who was not involved in the study, in an email to The Verge. ""They should have tested one of the classical models of autism,"" he said — meaning genetic models of autism — to see whether suramin indeed corrects autistic behaviors. Naviaux has heard such criticisms before, and argues that the model is appropriate given that serious viral infections and fevers during human pregnancy can increase the risk of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders in children. In addition, he said, the mouse model ""actually produces more severe symptoms"" than many of the conventional autism animal models. ""No animal model is a perfect match for complex human diseases like autism or schizophrenia,"" Naviaux said, but this is ""one of the best."" There are other possible limitations to this work. For example, this mouse model doesn't reproduce all behaviors linked to autism, such as repetitive behaviors. The study also involved a small number of mice, and the researchers only tested suramin on males. ""Genes interact with environmental factors."" It should also be noted that Naviaux's explanation for behavioral symptoms seen in people with autism spectrum disorder doesn't contradict current notions regarding its genetics. ""It is very clear that genes interact with environmental factors to cause autism,"" Naviaux said. But ""even in the rare cases of single genes that can increase the risk of autism spectrum disorders, no single-gene disorder produces [autism] in 100 percent of the children who have the gene."" The idea that autism might be the result of abnormal cell communication is still fairly new. But Naviaux thinks exploring the cell danger response theory is important. ""According to the theory, abnormal cell metabolism can result from genes, environment, or both,"" he said. So, the key to treatment may lie in finding the way to restore normal cell metabolism, and more normal development as a result. ""Some things that we thought were a permanent feature of the mouse models, are actually treatable with the right metabolic intervention,"" Naviaux said, which means that ""despite the permanent loss of certain brain cell connections in the mouse models of autism ... social and exploratory behaviors can be improved with the right treatment.""",0.50937871899826,0.49062128100173996,0.858531048589998,1040,5.2711538461538465,503,6.536779324055666,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And, unlike other wearables currently in the works, this one was able to correct low blood sugar levels, as well as high.  In the study, 20 adult participants were asked to stay in a hotel room for five days. They could eat and behave normally, but were asked to limit their alcohol intake, reports Time. The teenagers, on the other hand, were sent to a summer camp. During these experiments, the researchers said, the device performed better than conventional pumps and insulin monitors. These results were presented at the American Diabetes Association conference in San Francisco on Sunday, and the study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The device itself has three parts: two cell-phone sized pumps that administer insulin and glucagon, as well as an iPhone that connects to a glucose monitor.

""This is a person who has no understanding of what science is about,"" Cattaneo says. ""He is not a scientist.""   (Associated Press) Before becoming a controversial Italian figure, Davide Vannoni was a psychology professor at the University of Udine, in northeastern Italy. As an academic, he wrote a book — a manual on persuasive communication — but published little else. So it was purely by chance that he entered the world of stem cell research. Vannoni wrote a manual on persuasion ""I developed partial facial paralysis in 2001,"" Vannoni says, and ""I went to every kind of hospital and center for four years,"" but conventional treatments didn't work. He then traveled to Ukraine to receive stem cell injections that were being dispensed by two Russian scientists. ""In Ukraine, I met with different patients — someone with Parkinson's and someone with an autoimmune disease — and also I become friends with the researchers and with my contacts with the regional government."" Eventually, he says, ""I proposed to finance a lab and take these two Russians to Italy."" By 2007, the Stamina Foundation was treating patients. To recruit them, Vannoni and his team dispensed flyers in hospitals that claimed that they had treated over a thousand people, and that most patients had experienced a 70 percent to 100 percent recovery. Soon they were under investigation by the local police for treating patients with illegal stem cell preparations. Yet, the foundation still managed to fly under the radar until 2011, when they convinced doctors at a public hospital in Brescia to dispense the treatment. ""When they were in the basement, they were being investigated by the police,"" Cattaneo says. ""But when they started doing their stuff in a public hospital, any citizen would think it was a good thing."" And because the treatments were given in the hospital, Italy's national health services was footing the bill. each injection cost the government over $60,000 It's unclear how many patients have received Vannoni's ""Stamina method"" since 2007. Vannoni told me he has treated more than 100 patients ""with different diseases and they have had very good results."" Some of these treatments were performed outside of the hospital, and many patients paid for it themselves. But according to Science, each hospital-sanctioned injection cost the government over $60,000. And storing the cells for a year cost an additional $13,000. The physicians in Brescia justified their actions by saying that ""they didn't know what we were injecting,"" Cattaneo says, ""but that's crazy because it's part of your ethical duty to know what you are doing to your patients."" In May 2012, the Italian government shut down Vannoni's operations. But some patients took the case to court and Vannoni was able to resume his activities in March 2013 with 32 terminally ill patients, most of whom are children. Moreover, because numerous politicians expressed their support for the Stamina Foundation, Vannoni's credibility increased. And in May 2013, the government agreed to fund a $3.9 million clinical trial for the Stamina Method, although plans for the trial have since been halted. ""These treatments are dangerous."" According to Cattaneo, the technique is ineffective and carries many risks. But without a clinical trial, it's hard to know what effect the Stamina method might be having on Vannoni's patients. Some have reported improvements, whereas others have reported fevers and seizures following the injections. Regardless, Cattaneo says, there is little doubt that ""these treatments are dangerous."" As public opinion of Vannoni in Italy has become more polarized — the media portrays him as both a fraud and a hero — scientists have banded together. They spoke to politicians and prepared dossiers. They wrote letters to patients and gave numerous interviews. ""We have each sacrificed 60-80 weeks of lab time so far and have delayed submitting papers,"" the researchers write in the Nature article. But ""by early 2013, those of us objecting to Stamina were being vilified by Vannoni and by some media outlets as keeping children from life-saving treatments."" ""he copy-pasted from Wikipedia and other papers."" Despite the backlash, many of their efforts bore fruit. In October 2013, a committee of experts convened by Italy's health ministry evaluated the Stamina method. The scientists concluded that ""Vannoni's protocol didn't make any sense,"" Cattaneo says, especially since ""he copy-pasted from Wikipedia and other papers."" The panel's verdict stopped the clinical trial. But again, the Italian courts stepped in and rejected these conclusions because many of the researchers in the committee had already spoken out against Vannoni before the panel was convened. Today, the doctors who helped Vannoni in Brescia face charges of criminal conspiracy. And an investigation carried out by Nature demonstrated that Vannoni's 2010 patent application contained images duplicated from previous, unrelated studies. Furthermore, an Italian prosecutor issued a report in April in which he described Vannoni as ""the head of a criminal organization."" But the biggest victory came in May, when the European Court of Human Rights issued a ruling stating that patients should not receive treatments that aren't supported by scientific evidence. Now, a committee of scientific experts has been asked to evaluate Vannoni's methods once again, and Cattaneo is optimistic. Yet, according to Science, the panel could still propose a clinical trial. Threats from patients and their families As she talks about the last two years, hints of emotional fatigue creep up in Cattaneo's voice. Worrying about the man she calls a ""charlatan"" and his ""alchemy"" has taken a toll. Many of the researchers who spoke out against Vannoni ended up received threats from patients and their families. For a time, groups of protesters gathered outside Cattaneo's lab. This was mostly fine, she says, until one night she left the university late only to realize that ""four people were waiting for me"" outside. ""I called the police. Everyone thought we were criminals because we didn't want to give this ‘cure' to sick kids,"" she says. Many have speculated about Vannoni's intentions, even Cattaneo. ""There are two types of charlatans,"" Cattaneo says, ""the ones that want to sell things and fool people, and the ones who are also convinced that what they are doing is right."" Cattaneo isn't sure what kind Vannoni is, but says she isn't really concerned by him. ""What really concerns me are the institutions and courts who support Vannoni"" — not the mention the physicians in Brescia who dispensed these treatments for so long. ""Many physicians I spoke to were scared, but none raised their voice — except for a few."" ""Many physicians I spoke to were scared."" My own short phone conversation with Vannoni didn't yield any answers. He told me that scientists like Cattaneo have competing interests that impede their ability to judge his techniques objectively, and that people who can't get the treatment are dying as a result. He also tried to convince me that his treatments work and that the scientific method — one that requires control groups, safety testing, and years of study — is flawed. Instead, I wondered if the Stamina method was an elaborate art project meant to demonstrate how far his persuasive communication techniques could be taken. ""This is a person that has fooled the country and the patients,"" Cattaneo says. ""We still hope Stamina will be banned from the country.""",0.3890904623199152,0.6109095376800848,0.8463147891296688,1546,5.2509702457956013,717,6.4546722454672247,0,0,"Science, US & World, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As reported by Anchorage Daily News, it's part of a study being conducted by the University of Alaska to determine if posters warning women against drinking while pregnant are more effective when they're coupled with pregnancy test dispensers. Alaska currently has the highest known rate of fetal alcohol syndrome in the US — women in the state are 20 percent more likely to binge drink while pregnant. Officials are hoping the availability of pregnant tests can help to cut down on this problem; many women who end up causing fetal alcohol syndrome in a fetus do so during the first month, when they are often unaware of the pregnancy. Jody Allen Crowe, founder of a non-profit that focuses on installing pregnancy test dispensers in bars and stores around Minnesota, said that she hopes using these tests before drinking becomes as commonplace as the designated driver is now. The initiative will start out with 20 machines installed in bars and restaurants in three Alaskan cities, each with a poster warning against the dangers of fetal alcohol syndrome attached. In other cities, the same posters will be distributed, but without the pregnancy test dispenser — the goal is to see if the dispenser makes the message more effective, with relatively low expectations about how many women will actually take the test. David Driscoll from the University of Alaska said that """"relatively small percentage of women who will see the test kit dispenser"" will actually take the test.

This is what we call a stroke. But even though doctors have understood what goes on during these events for quite some time, researchers still don't fully grasp what causes heart attacks and strokes to happen in the first place. Now, two new studies, published independently yesterday in The New England Journal of Medicine, may yield some clues, as researchers have found that patients who posses a broken version of a gene that normally transforms fat particles into triglycerides are 40% less likely to experience a stroke, or a heart attack. In the first study, researchers mapped the genes of 3,734 Americans, two thirds of whom were white. With this information, the scientists were able to identify a gene, called APOC3, that appears to play a role in cardiovascular health. When it was broken because of a mutation — and was therefore unable to transform fats into triglycerides — people's risk of heart attacks were greatly reduced. The other study, which involved a lot more participants, had similar results. Using data from 75,725 participants, the researchers were able to demonstrate that having low triglyceride levels can reduce a person's heart attack risk by 36 percent. Moreover, people with low triglyceride levels appeared to have mutations that destroy APOC3. Amish people with broken APOC3 genes could eat foods loaded with fat These findings were actually hinted at in a much smaller study, published in 2008. In that study, researchers discovered that Amish people with broken APOC3 genes were able to keep their triglyceride levels stable, even when they ate foods loaded with fat. ""Nobody has been absolutely sure of the role of triglycerides in heart disease,"" Steven Nissen, chair of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, told Forbes. Nissen said these studies are a big deal, because even though they ""don't prove triglyceride-lowering heart drugs will work, they do lay the groundwork."" About 720,000 Americans experience heart attacks every year. Currently, many Americans take statins, a class of drug that reduces low-density lipoprotein — or LDL cholesterol — to lower their risk. These drugs are controversial, however, because although they reduce a patient's risk of having a heart attack, many experience them anyway. As a result, researchers have spent a lot of time looking for new drugs, but with little success. Moreover, drug companies have focused a lot energy on HDL cholesterol — the type is widely referred to as ""good cholesterol."" This may change, some researchers say, because these new studies hint that HDL cholesterol might not be a protective as we once thought. ""We probably had it backwards."" ""We probably had it backwards,"" Ethan J. Weiss, a cardiovascular research at the University of California San Francisco, told Forbes. ""we should be paying attention to triglycerides and ignoring HDL."" Weiss may be right, but years of research will be needed before doctors can say so for sure. Any new finding takes time to validate, but this one might be especially tricky because previous studies that have involved lowering triglyceride levels did not demonstrate that doing so reduces a patient's risk of heart attack or stroke. So, although some drugs already lower triglycerides, or act on the APOC3 gene, doctors won't prescribe them for this purpose just yet. But as the lead author of the first study, Sekar Kathiresan, told The New York Times, researchers now have ""a route to heart attacks that is independent of LDL [cholesterol]."" And that new route may be reason enough to hope.",0.47585190627460405,0.524148093725396,0.8512769233602663,612,5.1781045751633989,324,5.9598765432098766,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The network isn't an independent entity, however: Radiotopia is owned and supported by PRX, a nonprofit marketplace for public radio producers to buy and sell broadcasts.

HBO had a record year, and its numbers look much better than Netflix's right now.

There is no disputing that HBO is significantly more profitable than Netflix. HBO is way more profitable than Netflix, but Netflix is growing much faster Netflix, however, is growing much faster.

Sony would reportedly keep a small stake in a new venture built from the sale and continue to operate in markets where the brand is well-known — but otherwise it would exit the market in most countries. However, the VAIO business would continue to operate in Sony's home country of Japan, with a specific focus on the business market. While the sale to Japan Industrial Partners (estimated to be between $391 million and $489 million) isn't a done deal yet, it sounds like it could be official by the end of March — which would result in the company losing money on its fiscal year for the first time in two years. As for the staff of 1,000 currently dedicated to the VAIO business, most would either be absorbed by the buyer or transferred to other parts of Sony; it doesn't sound like a major round of layoffs would immediately accompany this sale. This comes at a time when Sony is trying to recapture the swagger and reputation for innovation it had during the 1990s — the company was an even bigger presence at CES 2014 than usual, with a number of innovative and unusual products on display. While Sony has been making a lot of noise with the PlayStation 4 and a renewed focus on mobile phones, things have been quieter with the VAIO business. The Nikkei reports that the company wants to continue putting more focus towards smartphones and that shedding the PC business, which is said to be a money-loser, would help facilitate that initiative.

""We have a long-standing, deep relationship with Microsoft, and are grateful to Steve for his partnership over the years. At the same time, we have tremendous confidence in Satya's expertise, experience and leadership.

Notably, Dell's comments begin with an expression of joy that Microsoft has concluded its CEO search. As much change as Nadella may or may not bring to the software giant, Microsoft's future path is now much easier to forecast with Ballmer's successor in place. And that might be the most important aspect to this executive change for all of Microsoft's PC hardware partners.

LG refused to comment on Microsoft's new appointment, however sources familiar with relations between the two companies say they haven't been helped by Microsoft becoming a smartphone manufacturer. A similar radio silence is in effect from Samsung and HTC — both declined to comment — and there's been persistent speculation about their displeasure with Microsoft prioritizing Nokia as its main Windows Phone partner. With Nokia being brought in-house, Nadella is likely to have a tough time convincing these phone-makers to stick with Microsoft's mobile platform. We have reached out to all of Microsoft's hardware partners, both big and small, and will update this article with their comments as we receive them. ""We are thrilled at the choice Microsoft went with. Satya has an incredible technical background, but where we feel he’s best suited is in his lack of being involved with too many areas of the company prior to being named CEO. In this regard, we believe Satya can bring fresh perspective to Microsoft as a whole. While some have said that Satya lacks the experience of running a public company, we believe that this is actually going to be his biggest asset. This would be like a fresh reboot for Microsoft. ""Sometimes when you start over fresh, you let go of the burden of knowing everything, and are free to rediscover and reinvent. This is where Microsoft is now, and we think it’s an amazing place."" — Tuan Nguyen, iBuypower. ""I'm happy to see that Microsoft promoted Satya Nadella from within and we are very excited to see how the PC gaming community, and all PC users, can benefit from his experience with connected devices and cloud centric services.

""We’re excited to see fresh new talent taking charge at Microsoft. Microsoft has always been behind the market with missed opportunities, hopefully that will change now.

They company had 241 million monthly active users, up only slightly from 232 million the previous quarter. The stock declined more than 10 percent on the news, likely reflecting investors' disappointment with the slowing user growth. Analysts had expected Twitter to lose 3 cents per share, according to consensus estimates gathered by Mark Mahaney at RBC Capital Markets. They were looking for about $217 million in revenue for the quarter, representing 94 percent growth from the previous year. At the time of its initial public offering in November of 2013, Twitter was on pace to earn roughly $500 million in annual revenue and had booked losses of $69 million for the year. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo addressed the company's anemic growth in an earnings call. ""We are doubling down in 2014 to accelerate the growth of our core user base,"" he said. Costolo said that recent redesigns have boosted favorites and retweets more than 35 percent, and that direct messaging has increased more than 25 percent. In addition, the company saw a 120 percent increase in search over the previous year, he said. ""We're doubling down in 2014 to accelerate the growth of our core user base."" Costolo laid out a three-pronged plan to increase user growth: improving the experience for new users, particularly on mobile devices; making it easier to have both public and private conversations on Twitter; and inserting more pictures and video into the timeline in an effort to attract more casual users. ""We will continue investing to make Twitter a more visually engaging medium across a number of dimensions,"" Costolo said. The company will also try ways of letting users browse tweets by topic and relevance in addition to basic chronology, he said. Twitter's Discover tab already shows tweets based on relevance, but Costolo's comments suggest that several more experiments around topics and relevance are forthcoming. Twitter's stock has soared since debuting Nov. 7th, rising from $26 to as high as $74 in the weeks leading up to today's earnings report. Investors' confidence in the company has been buoyed by the unexpectedly strong performance of Facebook, which now makes more than half its revenue from mobile advertising. Mobile ads are Twitter's core business. But the company has been dogged by concerns that it will never become a truly mainstream product. Twitter has only about one-fifth as many users as Facebook, and its growth rate has slowed markedly over the past year. That's one reason the company has been continuously redesigning its product, shaking up the core timeline of tweets in an effort to make it more approachable. Twitter projects it will earn $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion in 2014.

IPCom is suing Nokia over the same patent Though IPCom has agreed to license its patents on FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) terms, it's been a courtroom regular in recent years. This same patent, EP 1 841 268, has been used to sue Nokia, among others, too. The patent covers a technology that allows a device to receive priority on a network in the event of an emergency, even if the network is congested. Like many of its patents, IPCom acquired this one from another company. Its primary business is licensing these mobile communication patents to manufacturers in the industry. Companies like this, colloquially referred to as patent trolls, have become a major point of contention in the tech industry, with many — the US Congress included — working toward reform over concerns that they might stifle innovation. Another patent holding entity filed suit against Apple over its processor designs just last week. IPCom is also alleging infringement of a German patent that involves cell network communications as well, however it hasn't stated how much it's looking for in damages yet.

In a statement provided to The Verge, Whisper said ""We share the Senator's interest in protecting consumer privacy and will respond shortly.

The original report claimed that Whisper tracks the location of its users — even those who've opted out of geolocation services entirely — through a system that can pinpoint messages ""to within 500 meters of where they were sent."" For users with geolocation disabled, Whisper uses IP address tracking to get a rough idea of their location, The Guardian said. Other claims blasted the company's executives for secretly tracking users they believe to be ""newsworthy"" and sharing content with media companies without a user's permission. Whisper quickly fired back and denied nearly all of The Guardian's claims. Both sides have remained in a back-and-forth since the original story was published.

First, he's requested a definitive answer on whether Whisper now or in the past has tracked users with geolocation services turned off. (The company says it doesn't, noting that the nature of IP addresses allows some rough approximation of location to be made.) Rockefeller also wants to know how long Whisper holds onto user data — and where that information is kept. Another question asks Heyward to firm up the policy on sharing Whisper content with third parties.

After its devastating loss at the Supreme Court, Aereo has tried to argue that the high court's ruling should allow it to operate like any other cable provider and pay networks for programming licenses. But it hasn't found much support in court rooms, and US District Judge Alison Nathan basically squashed the idea in today's ruling. ""Doing its best to turn lemons into lemonade, Aereo now seeks to capitalize on the Supreme Court's comparison of it to a CATV system to argue that it is in fact a cable system that should be entitled to a compulsory license."" Nathan said that logic ""suffers from the fallacy that simply because an entity performs copyrighted works in a way similar to cable systems it must then be deemed a cable system for all other purposes of the Copyright Act."" She's granted the broadcasters just what they wanted: a nationwide preliminary injunction against Aereo. The motion doesn't rule one way or another on whether the injunction should impact delayed or pre-recorded content — only live programing falls under Nathan's filing.

Hungary has been taxing other private industries to make up for economic losses, but the public reaction to the tax has been negative. Although the taxes are aimed at service providers, internet users believe the costs will be passed on to them, and thousands said they would rally Sunday to protest the provisions.

Now Comey is bringing the argument straight to Congress, asking them to update a law to allow backdoors in smartphones. Comey is asking Congress to update CALEA The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, was passed in 1994, and required telephone providers to make it possible for law enforcement to wiretap phones. Newer forms of communication aren't explicitly mentioned in the law, and Apple's new encryption standards don't leave room for any government access. Even if government officials ask for data, Apple says, the company can't comply. (The same is true for Android.) Comey is asking Congress to update CALEA so law-enforcement backdoors would be legally required, but that could be a protracted battle: the debate over what law enforcement should be able to access has been going on for decades now, and privacy advocates have pushed back against recent measures. As The Hill reports, politicians like Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), two well-known advocates for internet freedom and privacy, have already said they'd a oppose a measure to broaden CALEA. Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) was more open to the idea, but even he admitted that passing an expansion wouldn't be easy.

I'm able to get in a few rounds of Threes while waiting for the train, or try to top my Alto's Adventure high score before going to bed. Til Morning's Light isn't like that at all. It's a huge, sprawling adventure that takes you through a massive haunted house filled with monsters and an alarming amount of locked doors. It's sort of like the first Resident Evil by way of Nickelodeon, and its size and scope make it feel like a game you'd find on the PS2. And the weirdest part might just be that it was made by Amazon. Til Morning's Light stars Erica, a teen girl who has been locked in a spooky-looking mansion as a prank. As it turns out, it's actually haunted, and she spends the rest of the game solving ancient mysteries in a quest to get out alive. The house itself is really the main character here. It's absolutely huge, filled with everything from eerie dining rooms to an underground crypt, and it's probably the biggest virtual environment I've ever explored on a mobile device. A horror game by way of Nickelodeon There are more than a hundred rooms to explore though, naturally, most are locked from the outset. Almost every room is home to some sort of puzzle, most very straightforward, video game-style brainteasers; you'll be pushing plenty of crates onto pressure-sensitive switches, and collecting gears to start up rusty, archaic machinery. It's not in any way unique, and the puzzles repeat a bit too often; even Erica will occasionally groan when spotting yet another locked chest. But there's a definite thrill in slowly opening up this huge building and finding all of its creepy secrets.   Aside from puzzles, the house is also filled with monsters, and it's here that Til Morning's Light really feels unique. Instead of standard third-person combat, the game uses a sort of rhythm game-like mechanic where you're swiping and tapping the screen at specific times in order to attack. It's a bit weird at first — and it's very similar to the Nintendo DS music game Elite Beat Agents — but it's also perfectly suited for a touchscreen, and it really helps break up the exploration. It only really falls flat during the boss battles, which force you to solve puzzles and battle weird monsters at the same time, creating an often frustrating mess. But while its core gameplay will feel pretty familiar to anyone who has played a third-person adventure game, it's the fact that it works, and works so well, on mobile that's impressive. The scale of Til Morning's Light is bigger than just about anything else on a smartphone: not only is the world huge, but the dialogue is fully voice acted, and the graphics look fantastic. There's an extras section where you can read about monsters and look at concept art, and there are other nice touches, like the way Erica's look changes as the night takes its toll on her; her clothes get torn and dirty, and at one point she loses her jacket. One of my favorite things in the game is just how cool the lighting looks, which makes pointing your flashlight around a darkened room an adventure in itself. Til Morning's Light was made in collaboration between Amazon Game Studios and Wayforward Technologies (the studio behind games like Ducktales Remastered and A Boy and his Blob) as part of a concerted effort to bring premium, non free-to-play games back to mobile. Amazon Game Studios VP Mike Frazzini previously told The Verge that the lack of these games was ""a gap that existed that we could potentially fill."" Til Morning's Light isn't the first game released through the program, but it's definitely the biggest and most ambitious so far. You can check it out for yourself now on both iOS and Amazon Fire devices, for $6.99.

It’s an homage to the solitary confinement cell in Orange Is The New Black, one of Netflix’s most popular original series. And just like the Shu in the show, Netflix’s version is a place of punishment — only of TVs, not humans. The Shu is actually a faraday cage, a shielded enclosure where outside signals can’t make their way in or out. It’s here where the company tests the latest TV sets as part of a new program that rewards TV makers that have designed sets on which Netflix shines. That means things like turning on quickly, and remembering what show people were watching the next time they open the Netflix’s app on the TV.  The designation program was unveiled back in January, but it’s only now beginning to make its way into this year’s crop of TV sets, something the company showed off to a small group of reporters during a day-long tour around its headquarters in Los Gatos, California, yesterday. Right now, only about 20 sets have been blessed with the designation, a figure Netflix hopes will grow throughout the rest of this year. Looking ahead, Netflix also plans to make its requirements a moving target, not only to keep up with new TV technologies, but to help push the ones it thinks should become new standards. Getting Netflix’s seal of approval is not a simple affair. The sets need to pass certain benchmarks, many of which are based on speed. For instance, Netflix’s app needs to start up within a certain amount of time, as do its videos once you hit the play button on your remote. Netflix is also counting how long it takes when you come back to its app after doing something else on your TV. Does it take too long to get back to your show after jumping out to watch sports or catch the local news? Better try harder next year. While those are examples of software, Netflix is also judging TV makers on their hardware. Its program requires TVs to turn on instantly, and it rewards sets that come with remotes with a dedicated Netflix button. Netflix considers these things necessary additions to help bring TV watching in line with what modern viewers have become accustomed to on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. ""A lot of this was inspired by innovation that was naturally happening in the phone and tablet space,"" says Brady Gunderson, who is Netflix’s director of product development.  ""When I turn my phone on, I never really turned it on because it was never off — it just comes right back where I left off, in the app I’m on. If I’m reading a news article, I’ll be right back to that article. TVs, meanwhile, when you turn them off and turn them on again, there’s some time to reboot, they lose all context, and the network has to come up."" ""They weren’t purpose built for internet TV,"" he adds, saying that all that’s changing this year. ""There’s some quantum leaps in terms of improving that experience. We think of this as the year the smart TV got smart."" To illustrate how quickly things have progressed, Gunderson  — who is joined by his colleague David Holland, a director of business development at Netflix — stage a competition between  last year’s crop of smart TVs to this year’s, some of which have been designated with the new standard. In each case, the newer set handily beats the old one on things like turning on, locking onto a Wi-Fi signal, keeping users from digging to find the Netflix app, and eventually starting up a show. In one particular matchup between Sony’s old Bravia TV set and its newer one running Google’s Android, we were already watching the opening credits of a film while the older TV had only just put some text on the screen to let us know it was warming up. The exercise is painful to watch: the older sets lag and struggle by comparison. Gunderson is careful to say that the program isn’t meant as a  threat that people should just give up watching Netflix on older TVs, or set their busted old 4K TV from 2014 on fire just to put it out of its obsolete misery. ""The message is not that this is bad,"" he says, pointing to the older set. ""It’s just about how much better these newer TVs are."" Much of the improvement has centered around a real sea change in the software TV makers are using. New in this year’s TV sets are things like Mozilla with its Firefox OS, and LG’s WebOS. There’s also Samsung with Tizen (which really only this year became ready for the world), and Sony embracing Google’s Android TV platform. Netflix’s recommendation could carry a lot of weight with hardware and software makers. It commands a paying army of ravenous viewers 62 million strong worldwide, and which is set to grow as Netflix expands into new territories like Japan. Not only is the company bringing its customers movies and TV shows from studios, but it’s also making its own programming that can’t be had elsewhere (unless you’re willing to wait for the DVD version, that is). And some of those shows are being shot in 4K and with high-dynamic-range, things that TV makers like because it means that people who weren’t even thinking about buying a new TV set a year or two ago now might suddenly want one to experience these things. While the side-by-side tests seem like a remarkably clear-cut way to test things, it’s not very scientific. That brings us back to the Shu. New TVs are bought from stores once they’ve been released, a process that like Consumer Reports’, involves sending out employees to make the purchases unbeknownst to the TV maker or any particular store that might try to weed out dud units. It’s then brought back to the cage of horrors, and run through a simulated home Wi-Fi network (they don’t do wired tests since most people with these TVs simply hook them up over Wi-Fi instead) that’s been throttled to match up with both good and bad speeds that can be expected in homes in America and elsewhere. The entire recommendation program was born out of what Gunderson says became a common, and often bothersome question from people at barbecues and other social gatherings. ""Because you work in TVs, they say ‘what TV should I buy?’ My answer was always ‘don’t buy one this year, wait until next year ‘ and it was never quite there. [Now] I do feel like it’s there — buy a TV this year."" That may be a fair assessment, but even some new model sets from major TV makers have not managed to make Netflix’s cut for one reason or another. Of the aforementioned requirements (things like the fast start and fast resume), Netflix is looking for at least five of seven criteria. That gives manufacturers some wiggle room to be approved, which Netflix points out does not cost set makers any money or require a fee for them to advertise their designation. But there have been cases where even high end, flagship sets from some TV makers are not approved. Right now that notably includes Samsung, which is the top TV maker in the entire world, along with budget set maker Vizio, neither of which have had any sets approved. Gunderson mentions both of these examples, then points to a small, inexpensive TV from HiSense that’s sitting in the Shu. It’s just been added to Netflix’s recommended list, despite its low cost and lesser picture quality compared to the sweeping Sony and LG sets mounted to the walls in the other room. That brings up one shortcoming of Netflix’s big thumbs up for TVs: it’s not looking at things like image quality, sound, ease of use, ecosystem, and myriad other factors that can be really important when you’re buying a new TV set. Instead, Netflix’s program has been designed only to address what the company believes are things that make using its software on those sets the best possible experience. If you don’t even plan to use the TV’s built-in Netflix app, and believe you’ll use it through a set top box, or HDMI stick like Roku, then this will have little impact. But it might not stay that way for long. Netflix has already begun pushing the technologies it’s using to present its programming. First it was 4K video, and now its high-dynamic range (HDR), technology designed to make the image on screen look more realistic, with brighter brights and darker darks, all intermingling in a way that is more pleasing to the eye. Holland says the company is incredibly wary about requiring these features in its evaluations given how new they are. ""We have a principle that in order for something to be included in the Recommended TV program, it needs to impact most of our members most of our time,"" he says. ""For the same reason that 4K is not part of the spec today, [HDR is] being limited to very high-end TVs and there’s very little content available."" Two things that are likely to be part of next year’s requirements? More stringent requirements for speed, and making sure that users can easily return to Netflix if there’s an interruption. ""We think the TV instant on feature could be faster. They take several seconds now,"" Gunderson says. ""Next year, we think they could be that much faster."" It’s a similar story for when you have to take a sudden break from watching something. ""Someone’s calling you downstairs and you turn the TV off, ‘did someone call me?’ [you ask] No. You go to turn the TV on, and the app comes back to snow, or live TV, or your row of apps."" The unspoken genius about all this is that Netflix is very carefully pushing TV makers to design what it believes to be the perfect Netflix experience while avoiding the need to become its own hardware maker. That’s something the company briefly contemplated in 2006 in the early days of its streaming service, before realizing it was better to focus on making software for computers and mobile devices made by others. While no money is being exchanged in this new program, the benefits are being pitched as a two-way street: TV makers who play ball might snap up sales from consumers who trust Netflix and believe they are getting what Netflix deems an optimal experience. Netflix, in turn, has made sure that the buyers won’t get so fed up with the TV software that they give up trying to use Netflix. In fact, if Gunderson and Holland are doing their jobs right, Netflix will be the best part of using your TV.",0.6316176850587432,0.36838231494125684,0.2557774036013086,1849,4.6706327744726881,800,6.0075000000000003,0,5,"Culture, Entertainment, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

But the rise of smartphones and tablets, mobile computers with a touchscreen interface, has changed all that. My son has been using an iPad since he was a little over one, and now, at two and a half, he is capable of using dozens of apps with ease. I've been amazed at how much it has taught him about letters, numbers, and shapes. But perhaps more impressive is just how durable Apple's original iPad is. Apple is known for the quality of its hardware, but they aren't considered particularly durable. We've all experienced a shattered iPhone screen, or know someone who has. And as Apple's mobile devices have gotten progressively thinner, some have been known to bend under pressure. But the first iteration of the iPad is an incredibly rugged device. Mine has been dropped, kicked, stepped on, and thrown. It has no visible injuries or performance issues. I don't think the iPad is waterproof, but the one we have has been covered in every bodily excretion known to man. It's served as an impromptu plate and an occasional chew toy. With just a little water and clean rag, you can wipe it down and it's good as new.   There have been some good essays written on the anorexic design culture of today's mobile devices. While consumers consistently rate longer battery life as a feature they desire, most flagship phones continue to strive for ever thinner bodies. I feel the same way, but with an eye to something that can take the kind of beating my kids dish out on a daily basis. Since I doubt Apple is suddenly going to start selling a rugged model of its tablet computer, my plan is to stick with the original until it kicks, then maybe buy another, or one generation later. Sure, it won't run the latest software, but a three-year-old won't know that. It will be cheap, and best of all, toddler proof.

Do we have a problem of overuse?” That was the opening salvo in a line of questions to Sundar Pichai. Conor Doughtery peppered the Google VP of product with questions related to smartphone intrusion for an interview published Sunday in The New York Times. The following excerpt caught my attention: NYT: I think everyone recognizes that phones free people in ways that weren’t possible before, and have changed our lives. But then people start doing things like checking their email at dinner. Are there things Google is doing to return people to where they are and reduce the temptation to look at their phone? Pichai: You’re asking questions that have nothing to do with technology. Should kids check phones at dinner? I don’t know. To me that’s a parenting choice. Wait — wait just one second. As a parent, I take umbrage with Pichai’s absolutist response. Especially since the Android OS he’s in charge of can be found on 80 percent of all smartphones sold worldwide. Family dinner is sacred. As anyone versed in social etiquette will tell you, dinner is a social event, not an event for utilitarian consumption. It’s the 30 minutes or so carved from every 24-hour day that requires the attention of those involved. To say the distractions caused by smartphones have nothing to do with technology is just untrue. I get Pichai’s pedantic argument: give users the best experience possible and then let them decide how to apply the technology to their lives. But increasingly the user is a child who needs help making life choices. A September NPD study says that 71 percent of households with a child age 4-14 reported owning a smartphone in 2014. Of those, 35 percent said that their child uses a smartphone, up from 21 percent in 2012. In the UK, an October Ofcom report noted that most children aged 8 to 15 own three or more media devices — with 41 percent of 12-year-olds owning a smartphone, jumping to 67 percent by the time they turn 13. In the same NYT interview, Pichai relates his own method for controlling smartphone disruptions at corporate dinners. ""Before Google I/O we used to go out for dinner the day before the keynote and I would make everyone on the team put all their phones in a basket,"" said Pichai, ""so that we can all have a good dinner together."" How quaint. You’d think Google’s powerful machine learning capabilities could create a virtual basket. After all, Google knows when all the people from the same dinner invite are located in the same location at the same time. If the meeting was marked ""quiet,"" for example, surely their phones could be silenced for the duration? Likewise, families with small children tend to eat dinner at the same time each day, especially during the week. The same quieting rules could also be applied automatically to every family member’s Android device. It’s worrisome when the head of Android states that technology has no responsibilities to temper these types of social intrusions. It's clearly a shared responsibility with the parents. And with more devices presenting more distractions than ever, truly smart technology is a must for parents to do their jobs well.  This afternoon I went down to the company’s headquarters, situated in a nondescript Kyoto suburb peppered with run-down garages and overgrown playgrounds. A forlorn employee made her way through the gate, wiping a tear from her cheek, and as I saw the Nintendo flag flying at half-mast I was hit by a tidal wave of sorrow. For any other company, for any other president or CEO, I wouldn’t have felt this way. But Satoru Iwata was more than just a CEO to many. Iwata will be remembered as more than just a businessman — he offered a charming and human face to a company already beloved by legions of game fans. Comcast is launching a new streaming cable TV service, called Stream, that will let Xfinity internet customers pay $15 a month on top of their internet bill to watch shows from around a dozen networks on tablet, laptop, and smartphone. Stream is launching in beta form first in Boston at the end of the summer, before moving to Chicago and Seattle before the end of the year. The box art for Windows 10 is a rather simple affair. While Windows 8 displayed Microsoft’s new Windows logo prominently at the center of its packaging, the Windows 10 box art focuses on the new light-powered Windows 10 wallpaper. It’s a little less obscure than the colorful Windows 8 packaging, and it also shows potential owners exactly what Windows 10 looks like. The particular details of the deal are still filtering out, but the buildup to the decision was filled with apprehension, which found expression through a pair of trending hashtags on Twitter: #ThisIsACoup and #TsiprasLeaveEUSummit. New York Times economist Paul Krugman endorsed the former hashtag in a withering essay on Sunday criticising the ""pure vindictiveness [and] complete destruction of national sovereignty"" inherent in the proposed measures.

In her resignation letter, Pao says her time at the helm of one of the internet's most vibrant and influential communities has ""been an adventure"" since day one. ""I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly,"" Pao said, with the latter — especially recently — causing her to ""doubt humanity."" ""I am just another human; I have a family, and I have feelings."" But Pao says the good has outweighed the bad by a huge margin, and she's thankful for those who rejected and pushed back against the disgusting behavior exhibited by Reddit's worst users over recent weeks. Pao isn't leaving because of the threats, twisted words, and harassment, though. Those ""trolls,"" as she openly calls them, are likely in the midst of a victory dance, but that's not what this really is. ""Ultimately, the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining Reddit’s core principles,"" Pao wrote. Her full letter follows below. Emphasis added by Ellen Pao. After more than two years at reddit, I have resigned today. My first day was April 1, 2013 (go orangered!), and every day since has been an adventure. In my eight months as reddit’s CEO, I’ve seen the good, the bad and the ugly on reddit. The good has been off-the-wall inspiring, and the ugly made me doubt humanity. I just want to remind everyone that I am just another human; I have a family, and I have feelings. Everyone attacked on reddit is just another person like you and me. When people make something up to attack me or someone else, it spreads, and we eventually will see it. And we will feel bad, not just about what was said. Also because it undercuts the authenticity of reddit and shakes our faith in humanity. What has far outshone the hate has been the positive on reddit. Thank you, kind strangers, for expressing your support. You gilded me 100 times. (For those of you who apologized for generating a wave of accusations that I gilded myself, please don’t feel bad. You did a good thing.) And thank you for sending cute animal pics and encouraging me to ""Stay safe!"" when the site overheated with expressions of hate in various forms. There were some days when your PMs inspired me more than you can imagine. Most touching were the stories from regular users. Some told of people they knew who had committed suicide for being transgender or exposed in revenge porn. Others shared their experiences of being harassed and expressed empathy and gratitude. More recently, several users apologized for trolling me and for not giving me the benefit of the doubt when the troll hivemind moved against me. Initially users said they were afraid to post supportive messages openly; recently they started fighting back against the trolls publicly on reddit with support, corrections and positive messages. So why am I leaving? Ultimately, the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining reddit’s core principles. You will be in good hands -- our strong leadership team will now be led by u/spez, one of reddit’s original co-founders. Like u/kn0thing, he’s lived and breathed reddit since its inception and will work passionately to ensure reddit’s success. Thank you to all the users who shared your excitement about reddit and what we’ve done and for encouraging everyone to remember the human.

The technique, which has yet to be tested on humans, aims to help women who suffer from mitochondrial disease conceive a baby to which they are genetically related. But as the science inches closer to the human trial stage — some say that might happen in as little as two years — the scientific debate surrounding ""three-parent babies"" grows louder, and more polarized. Just last week, for instance, a British scientific panel decided that the fertility technique is ""not unsafe"" for patients who suffer from mitochondrial disease. The decision hints that British government may soon amend legislation that currently bars the procedure, called mitochondrial replacement (MR), from entering human trials. Yet an American scientific panel reached a different conclusion in February when it decided that the science supporting MR was inconclusive and lacking. Thus, the first baby with three genetic parents will likely be British, and the two countries that are seriously considering human trials are unlikely to reach a consensus before its birth. Mitochondria are tiny cellular subunits located within the cell's cytoplasm, but outside of the nucleus. They generate the energy that cells need to carry out their functions. But some people — an estimated 4,000 people in the US each year — are born with faulty mitochondrial DNA, which can cause a range of health problems, including seizures, blindness, heart problems, and liver disease. Furthermore, because this type of DNA is only passed on by women, potential mothers with mitochondrial disease often live in fear of passing down what occasionally turns out to be a fatal health condition. For affected couples, MR therefore represents a welcome solution that could allow them to have a healthy child to which both parents are genetically related — and the fact that the technique involves using genes from a third person might very well be worth it. Combining genes from two women and a man ""It's a splendid way of relieving the threat of a life-limiting disease for which there is no alternative intervention available,"" says Alastair Kent, director of Genetic Alliance UK, a national charity that supports people with genetic conditions. But ""I think the question now is ""is the science there yet?"""" On the surface, the science that powers MR is deceptively simple. To avoid conceiving children with faulty mitochondrial DNA, scientists simply take a donor egg from a woman with normal mitochondria, remove its nucleus, and insert the nucleus of an affected mother in the egg instead. The affected mother still contributes 25,000 genes to the fertilization process, but a small quantity of genetic material from the cytoplasm — 37 genes, to be exact — is provided by a female donor. Once the embryo is created, the affected mother can carry it to term herself (although carrying a child can be risky for some women with mitochondrial disease). This won't lead to ""lesbian designer babies."" But those considerable advantages don't change the fact that any child conceived through mitochondrial replacement will be carrying genetic components from three people. Understandably, the idea has captivated the public's imagination, and even led to explanations about why this won't give rise to ""lesbian designer babies"" (MR will only be offered to couples dealing with mitochondrial disease). But most scientists assert that the procedure is actually more akin to organ donation than an experiment produced in Frankenstein's lab. ""It's no different from somebody who has received a bone-marrow transplantation,"" says Evan Snyder, a human geneticist at the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute in California who chaired a meeting of the FDA's Gene Therapies Advisory Committee in February, ""because every organ and your blood now also represents a third individual."" Furthermore, many argue that the number of genes an egg donor would contribute is too small to warrant debating a child's parental origins. ""I wouldn't say that the ‘third parent' has much of a contribution,"" says Shoukhrat Mitalipov, a developmental biologist at the Oregon Health and Science University who used MR successfully to breed four rhesus macaques in 2009. But Kent puts it more bluntly: ""The woman who provides the mitochondria won't be a parent, because mitochondrial DNA isn't the part of the DNA that determines who we are."" 37 genes don't make you a parent Yet these kinds of arguments can also be used to critique the push for human MR. ""Keep in mind that it's a very rare condition and being severely affected is not the standard, so they are targeting a tiny number of women,"" says Katharine Wenstrom, a geneticist at Brown University in Rhode Island. That view might not hold much weight with British scientists, says David King, director of Human Genetics Alert, a UK-based public watchdog group. ""There exists a dogma that nothing should be allowed to stand in the way of a high-tech medical benefit, however minimal that benefit is expected to be."" Of course, the arguments for MR aren't purely medical. ""This deals with not only the medical urgency, but also the elective desires of parents who want the kids they raise to have their genetic components,"" Snyder says. There are many other strategies that can help these couples — including adopting and conventional egg donation — but they don't allow women with mitochondrial disease to have children that combine their own genetic makeup with that of a male partner. But beyond these considerations lies a much deeper issue, King says: the question as to whether humanity is ready for children who are genetically tailored — or ""designed"" — to avoid certain traits. ""This would be the first case of intentionally manipulating a child's genome,"" he says. ""And we are crossing that line for the sake of what exactly? For a very small number of families who already have options that allow them to raise children."" So far, the ethical questions surrounding MR have largely overshadowed the science. But for some critics, the science itself is enough cause for worry. ""Some [gene expression] patterns are modulated by the mitochondria,"" Wenstrom says, ""which raises the concern that if the mitochondria and the nucleus don't interact perfectly, genes might be turned off, and we might see birth defects."" ""we might see birth defects"" King agrees, adding that research in animals — namely the successful birth of four monkeys — is scanty. ""I think that the monkey data are certainly relevant, but they are not by a long way sufficient. We need to look at quite a larger number of cases."" That same argument was used by the FDA advisory committee in February, says Snyder. ""We need to do longer follow-up of the offspring — there are some gaps that need to be filled."" But Mitalipov thinks the technique is ready. His lab used MR to produce normal-looking human embryos in 2012 and that piece of evidence, he says, ""was very supportive."" And the four rhesus macaques he bred in 2009 have turned into normal adult monkeys. ""They're healthy,"" Mitalipov says, ""and now we are breeding them to see what happens to the next generation.""   Crysta, one of the four rhesus macaques produced using mitochondrial replacement. (OHSU, Mitalipov Lab) Already, researchers are brainstorming other uses for mitochondrial replacement. ""We think that lots of the egg quality depends on the cytoplasm and mitochondria,"" Mitalipov says, so ""there is big hope that this procedure will help women who are advanced in age with egg quality problems."" But the idea has its share of detractors. ""There is no scientific reason to suspect that extra mitochondria would treat infertility,"" Wenstrom says, ""especially since people with mitochondrial disease aren't infertile."" Despite this lack of evidence, many researchers think the technique could help older women conceive. ""Animals don't have this ‘egg aging' problem. But problems begin around the age of 37 in humans, and the drop in egg quality is dramatic,"" Mitalipov says. That's why it's ""kind of expected that [MR] will help."" ""The UK has always been a little more progressive."" What is perhaps most striking about this debate is how differently experts in the UK and the US have evaluated the scientific evidence — especially because both looked at the same studies. ""The UK has always been a little more progressive, even when you go back 10 years in terms of stem cells,"" says Louis DePaolo, chief of the Fertility and Infertility Branch at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. But King thinks this attitude has more to do with scientific prestige than anything else. ""Ever since Dolly the sheep, the British government has been keen to establish the British world lead in all of that,"" he says. ""The powers that be are very dead set on pushing this through Parliament, and I have no doubt that they will."" In the US, getting MR to human trials is bound to take more time. ""The FDA has not made any decision,"" said FDA spokesperson Jennifer Rodriguez in an email to The Verge, adding that the agency, ""recognizes that there are moral, ethical, and social policy issues related to genetic modification of oocytes, and that these issues have the potential to affect regulatory decisions."" Moral, ethical, and social policy issues ""If you have a technology that can assist couples who are at risk for having affected children, then using it is a good thing to do,"" Kent says. ""It's human use of science."" But for those who oppose mitochondrial replacement, arguments like that only highlight that we have yet to determine how far we're willing to let such human uses go. ""In the end, the first child that will be born will be an experiment,"" King says. ""And once you cross that particular ethical line, it's extremely hard to prevent it again.""",0.6222356971258063,0.3777643028741937,0.8673464357148658,1657,5.1104405552202774,763,6.470511140235911,0,0,"Science, US & World, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The particular Model S I flew to Los Angeles to sample last week was a Signature Performance model. That means that it was one of the first 1,000 to roll off the assembly line (indicated by the “Signature” designation) and is fitted with a high-output electric inverter that can propel the car from 0 to 60 in just 4.4 seconds, a key metric that slots it in with some of the fastest production sedans in the world. It’s a stat I would come to test on numerous occasions over the following 36 hours — within the bounds of the “no street racing” clause I agreed to upon taking delivery, of course. But I arrived in LA fully expecting to hate this modern marvel of a car. I was raised in Detroit, the son of a woman who has worked at General Motors for nearly half a century. Tesla’s emergence was, perhaps, a little uncomfortable for someone who’d grown up surrounded by the infallible Big Three. I felt a little bit like former Palm CEO Ed Colligan in his infamous (and ill-fated) takedown of the iPhone: “they’re not just going to walk in,” I thought. The regulatory and financial hurdles are enormous just to make a single terrible car, let alone a good one that people will actually want to buy. This is the same market that has chewed up and spit out pillars of the industry like Saab. It has bankrupted GM and Chrysler, sent Ford to the brink. Fisker Automotive — a Tesla competitor with similar ambitions — is on the ropes, desperately seeking a buyer and a cash infusion. How can billionaire Elon Musk’s venture possibly amass the money, know-how, ingenuity, and quality to shake up the automotive world? And just as importantly, do it profitably? Those aren’t easy questions to answer. Tesla hopes for its first quarter of black ink this year after a decade of operation, but make no mistake, it’s still in the throes of startupdom. Much of its working capital has come from nearly half a billion dollars in low-interest rate government loans. It has just a few dozen dealers around the world. Even Tesla’s choice of Palo Alto for its headquarters — some 2,000 miles from the Motor City — is a little audacious. This isn’t your granddad’s car company; it’s a child of the Valley. But I wasn’t in Palo Alto. I started my journey in Los Angeles because that’s where Tesla’s design studio is located, a corrugated metal hangar just steps from the single-runway Hawthorne Municipal Airport where military contractor Northrop once designed and built iconic aircraft like the T-38 Talon. Next door, Musk’s other big venture, SpaceX, occupies a giant ex-Northrop building. As I pull into the corporate park driveway that the two companies share, I see what appears to be a space capsule peeking through an open cargo door. Musk himself is very actively involved in both companies; a Tesla spokesperson tells me that he switches between the two on a daily schedule, traveling constantly between facilities in Northern and Southern California. I like to imagine him flying directly into Hawthorne rather than LAX about ten minutes away, perhaps in a futuristic aircraft or spacecraft of his own design. Inside the lobby of the cavernous Tesla hangar, a tall wall keeps prying eyes out of the studio area, where loud whirring sounds give the impression of a staff hard at top-secret work — most likely on the upcoming Model X SUV, which Tesla wants to launch next year. There’s a concept Model X sitting in the lobby, but it’s obviously not a driving prototype; the interior appears to be a mockup carved out of foam. Apart from the Model X and a few paint samples for prospective buyers to peruse, there isn’t much for the public to see at the design studio (that’s one thing Tesla has in common with the Old Guard car companies it’s trying to displace: R&D secrecy). Out front, a prototype Supercharging station serves as the reference for Tesla’s vision of a nationwide network of ultra-fast chargers that can give its cars half a charge in about 30 minutes — and more importantly, do it on renewable power alone. It doesn’t look much different than a typical gas station, except that you won’t find any attendants or payment systems here — the chargers are free — and, of course, there’s no gas available. It’s open to Model S owners, who occasionally pull up, plug in, and hang out with other owners and Tesla employees in the lobby for a few minutes while they’re waiting for the battery to top off. It’s here that I meet Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla’s chief designer and an auto industry veteran who has prolific stints at Volkswagen Group, Mazda, and General Motors under his belt. ""I think that’s one of the things that sets us apart a little bit […]  we’re very much designing for production,"" he tells me. ""We’re designing with a vision of getting this product to the road and into people’s hands as fast as possible. Our concepts are always with the idea of making it to the road."" That includes the SUV’s exotic ""falcon wings,"" which open straight up to make it easier to get in and out. Eventually, von Holzhausen bids us a pleasant trip, and we get down to the nitty gritty of strategizing a cross-country stint in a vehicle that can’t take gasoline. Our plan was to meander up the Pacific coast from LA to San Francisco, stopping to recharge both the car and our bodies in Morro Bay, a sleepy village on the ocean known for its giant rock. Morro Bay lacks one of Tesla’s ultra-fast Superchargers, but it does have a so-called Level 2 charger; it takes a lot longer to top off the battery with a Level 2, but if we let it sit there overnight, we figured it should be good by morning. For comparison’s sake, you couldn’t make the trip from LA to the Bay Area on a single tank of gas in most cars, but finding a gas station is very rarely a problem. There are a number of apps like PlugShare that help EV owners track down available chargers, but the Model S itself doesn’t yet include a built-in charger directory. With that, we set out onto Interstate 405 to meet up with US Route 101, which we’ll end up taking most of the way from Southern to Northern California. Though Tesla had given me a comprehensive walkthrough of the car in preparation for the journey, this is the first time that I’m actually behind the wheel and in motion. It’s a trip, both literally and figuratively. Once you’re rolling, the Model S quickly seduces you. It’s the accelerator: it responds instantaneously, smoothly, and effortlessly, as if you have nearly limitless power at your disposal. Someday, humans will all drive electric vehicles and this bizarre, science-fiction sensation will be completely normal. For those of us who’ve driven cars powered by controlled explosions of fossil fuel their whole lives, though, mashing the pedal of the Model S is an eye-opening sensation that takes some getting used to. Before long, I was rocketing down El Camino Real with no real sense of speed, only astonishment that electric motors and a battery pack alone could propel this 4,600-pound vehicle at a rate that made everyone around me look like chumps. To be clear, the kind of white-knuckle acceleration offered by this vehicle doesn’t come cheap. Though a base Model S can be had for as little as $52,400 after a $7,500 federal tax credit — still more money than most of us have ever paid for a car — the Performance model starts at a sobering $87,400. Fully equipped, the price can climb just north of $100,000. At that point, you’re dancing with supercar territory. As the curb weight suggests, this is not a small car. At 196 inches long, the Model S is only 3.8 inches shorter than BMW’s stately 7 Series (in standard wheelbase trim). It’s deeply handsome from every angle but doesn’t stand out in a crowd; if you squint your eyes, it could look like anything from a $25,000 Toyota Camry to a $200,000 Aston Martin Rapide. Even Tesla’s relatively muted color choices for the car — there are no fluorescent yellows or oranges available like on the old Roadster — tell the story that it wanted to make something that regular people would feel okay buying. ""I felt it was really important to make sure that the first product, or the first few products, were desirable right out of the gate. Not quirky, not unique, not strange,"" von Holzhausen told me. And yet the Model S doesn’t actually blend in at all. What struck me throughout our entire trip was how many random passers-by — how bloody many — would stop us to ask about the car. What is it? Is it Italian? Is it for sale yet? Can my son sit in it? It’s electric? Some would drive by on the highway, grinning ear to ear with a thumbs-up and an approving honk. Settling in for the 200-mile drive to Morro Bay (with plenty of stops in between for lunch in Santa Barbara, coffee, and gratuitous video and photo ops), I realized that I finally had to contend with the Model S’s unprecedented driver controls. Or rather, driver control, singular: in place of an average car’s array of buttons, knobs, and small displays, the Model S has an enormous 17-inch capacitive touchscreen mounted vertically down the middle of the dashboard, angled slightly toward the driver for viewability and ease of reach. Perhaps more than the newfangled electric drivetrain, nothing worried me more about the Model S — nothing brought out more of the curmudgeonly ""get off my lawn"" mentality — than this touchscreen. Nearly every component in a modern car is designed to enhance safety and keep drivers better focused on the task of driving; traditional knobs and buttons help drivers keep their eyes on the road because they instinctively come to know where things are. They can feel out a volume control here, a temperature control there without having to look down. I challenged von Holzhausen on why he went with this configuration. He’s prepared for it, pointing out that the car can evolve over time because it’s not locked into physical controls: as Tesla rolls out software updates — which are downloaded over the air, just like a smartphone — the UI can get better and offer more features. Knobs can’t. ""We actually built into the UI in the whole development process this idea of muscle memory, too,"" he continued. ""It was important that we kept, in some areas, some easy to reach and persistent pushes."" He noted that things like temperature controls and music volume are permanently docked in the same location at the bottom of the screen. The gadget nerd in me wanted to love this giant glowing rectangle in the dash, obviously, but the driver in me wanted it gone and replaced with more traditional controls. To be fair, the display is undeniably cool: Tesla clearly put a good deal of thought into the Nvidia Tegra 3-powered user interface, which includes a strip of functions along the top that can be dragged into either of two panels (each of which is still larger than an average high-tech car’s display). That means you can show, say, navigation and music controls at the same time. Or a graph of energy consumption and a live view of your rear-view camera. Or a web browser. Yes, the Model S has a web browser. But it shouldn’t. It doesn’t even lock you out while driving, a design decision I cursed when my Reddit-addicted video producer seated next to me started browsing ""Malicious Advice Mallards"" uncontrollably while I was flying down the 101. Tesla insisted to me that it thinks drivers should be responsible enough to decide when and how to use the controls of their vehicles, but the temptation for a news junkie to load up, say, CNN at 80 miles per hour could be far too great. And you think texting while driving is distracting? I was actually surprised that existing US or European regulations don’t prevent something like a giant touchscreen with a full web browser in a dashboard from being sold in the first place, but I think the Model S is a case where private industry has simply run circles around the molasses-esque bureaucracy of our government: in three, five, or ten years, I would be shocked if this kind of hardware and software configuration was legal. I don’t want a web browser in my car, and more importantly, I don’t want the drivers around me to have one. Pulling into scenic Santa Barbara for lunch, I noticed a few touches that will freak out drivers experiencing the Model S for the first time. For instance, there’s quite literally no ignition, nor one of those start-stop buttons that have become popular in recent years. There’s no power switch at all. As long as the key fob — shaped like a Model S — is on you, you just get in and start driving. When you’re done, you just get out. It’s a weird thing to get used to, because you feel like you’re missing a step somewhere. The key fob has some other tricks up its sleeve, too. Walking away automatically locks the car, which causes all four door handles to retract flush with the body — it made me feel like I was in a sci-fi movie every single time it happened. When you walk back up to the car, the handles extend. But these aren’t mechanical handles: pulling on them detects your touch, which triggers a motorized latch and allows the door to be opened. Besides being wicked cool, the motorized handles give the Model S an ever-so-slight aerodynamic advantage when it’s in motion. After lunch, we returned to the car and set out for Morro Bay. We intentionally didn’t seek out a charger in Santa Barbara because we wanted to push the Model S’s battery to its limits: the Performance model is rated for 265 miles, it’s about 200 from LA to Morro Bay, and Tesla warned us that we’d lose a little range with a car full of equipment and people, perhaps getting 250 miles out of it. Also, we were being generous with the accelerator and running up and down some fairly hilly terrain, another knock on our total range. By the time we passed San Luis Obispo on the highway, it was no longer clear whether we’d actually make it the next dozen-odd miles to Morro Bay, and I needed to make a call on whether we’d chance it or cry uncle and find a charger in town. I kept going, partly out of stubbornness — I’d set out earlier in the day running the numbers and never doubting that we’d be able to make it all the way — and partly out of the masochistic belief that running out of power would make for a good story. Admittedly, I hadn’t really thought through the drama and strife that could come from being stranded on the side of Highway 1 with a dead Tesla. There were some tense moments on that final stretch, culminating in a painfully long hill leading into Morro Bay that I was almost certain would do us in. The estimated range on my instrument panel at that point was one mile. I needed a charger immediately. I turned off the radio and climate control to save power, fogging the windows to the point that I nearly couldn’t see. Fortunately, we had one of those strokes of luck on that chilly evening in Morro Bay, and our chase car rooted out the location of the one charger in town before our $100,000 toy died. But had we needed even another five minutes to find it, we could’ve been in a world of hurt. Pushing a two and a half-ton car up a hill doesn’t sound fun. Out of a rated 265 miles of range, we got well under 250 from an effectively full charge provided by the Supercharger in LA to empty. I can't say that the battery was charged precisely to 100 percent capacity when we departed LA — and we spent plenty of time messing around in Santa Barbara along the way — but if not, it was close. We'd been plugged into that Supercharger for a long time. It's reminiscent of The New York Times' somewhat controversial experience with range anxiety, and a reminder that a built-out network of Superchargers are going to be crucial to making cross-country travel a practical reality for the Model S. Because this was an industry-standard Level 2 charger that we'd arrived upon in Morro Bay, not a Tesla Supercharger, we needed to use an adapter which is supplied with the car to connect. We knew it’d take several hours to fill the enormous 85kWh battery with enough juice to make it to our next destination the following morning, Tesla’s Supercharging station in Gilroy (by comparison, Chevy’s Volt launched with just a 16kWh pack). The company supplied us with an iPod touch loaded with its iOS app that can monitor the car’s charging status, so we grabbed it and headed to our hotel several blocks away. The app is cool: it gives you a precise map of your car’s location — convenient for parking in the vast tarmac expanse of a megamall — and lets you honk the horn, change charging modes, and see how long you’ve got to a full charge. It takes advantage of the Model S’s built-in 3G connection that uses AT&T’s network; you pay Tesla a monthly fee to use it, and it lets the car download software updates, connect to the web, use Slacker, and so on. If you’re a Model S owner, it’s an ongoing expense that you’re going to want to pay. There is a phenomenon among electric car drivers known as ""range anxiety."" It’s a well-documented problem, and it’s not without merit: stories of dead Nissan Leafs and dead Teslas from overly optimistic drivers are all over the internet. At an event in Chicago last week hosted by Cadillac to demonstrate the new ELR, which runs on the same gas-electric hybrid platform as the Chevy Volt, chief engineer Chris Thomason drove the point home. ""Not to take anything away from Tesla,"" he said. ""I just drove 1,000 miles in this car. There is no range anxiety."" Thomason noted that GM has full electric vehicles in its lineup, too — the problem is that the charging infrastructure simply doesn’t exist yet to take an EV on a cross-country trip without planning it with extreme precision, care, and a stroke of luck or two. We woke up the next morning, checked the Tesla app, and discovered that our ride was nearly topped off. We thought we had more than enough in the metaphorical tank to make it to Gilroy, but we’d said the same thing the day prior and nearly had heart attacks trying to get to Morro Bay, so it was really anyone’s guess whether we’d actually survive the mountainous 160-mile journey along the gorgeous Pacific Coast Highway. Cruising along this beautiful stretch of Highway 1 through Big Sur is incredible in any car, much less an electrified one capable of doing fairly stupid things on long stretches of straight, empty, flawless asphalt. It was here that I really felt that I’d become one with the Model S’s suspension and drivetrain: the motor all but defies the car, which weighs nearly a ton more than the sprightly Roadster that preceded it. The battery pack is mounted at the lowest point, below the axles, which contributes to an extraordinarily low center of gravity (CG), which makes the Model S feel glued to the road no matter how many Big Sur twisties you take at high speed. The height of the suspension can be adjusted (through settings on the big touchscreen, of course) to accommodate steep driveways and other obstacles, but at speed, it automatically sinks to a fierce stance that further contributes to a low CG. Rear-wheel drive — the preferred drivetrain of many driving fanatics — also helps to tear up curves, though it’s a problem in snowier climes than California. There’s no all-wheel drive configuration available yet, though it’s coming on the Model X next year. As we drove deeper and deeper into the wilderness, our phones stopped working one by one. There are dozens, perhaps hundreds, of miles along the California coast that are essentially untouched, which makes cellular signals hard to come by. Problem is, the Model S’s navigation system relies on its 3G connection to download Google Maps. 95 percent of the time — when you’re within shouting distance of civilization — that’s a good thing, because it means your maps are always up to date. But when you get out in the sticks, thing start to fail. The basemap started turning solid gray so we couldn’t see where we were or where we were going. When we pulled over to shoot some pictures, our preprogrammed navigation route to Gilroy was gone and we couldn’t bring it back without a signal. It seemed like a strange oversight that the car wouldn’t cache the map and the route for situations like this; fortunately, there’s only one Pacific Coast Highway, so I wasn’t too worried about getting lost. We made it to Gilroy with about 20 miles of range left, low enough to feel a pang of concern but not outright panic. Calling Tesla’s Supercharging station here a ""station"" is being a little generous: it’s really just four chargers mounted in the far corner of a strip mall’s parking lot, a few feet away from a pair of Level 2 chargers that were being used by a plug-in Toyota Prius and a beautiful white Fisker Karma. I was surprised to discover that three of the four Supercharger units were in use, two by brand new cars that hadn’t yet gotten license plates and a third by a black Tesla-owned vehicle with ""PROTOTYPE CAR"" labeled across the side. We slid into the fourth spot and paid a visit to a nearby In-N-Out. And that’s exactly what Tesla expected us to do: ""Superchargers are located at places you’ll actually want to stop, like roadside diners, cafes, and shopping centers. So pull in, plug in, and grab a bite to eat. Model S will be ready when you get back,"" reads the company’s Supercharging site. We expected to spend about half an hour charging; it’s only about 90 miles from Gilroy to our final destination in San Francisco, so we didn’t need to top it off, which would’ve taken a couple hours. But when we returned to the car, we met up with Mark, an engineer from San Diego who’d just picked up his Model S from Tesla’s Fremont factory after joining the waiting list in August of 2011 and was charging in preparation for the trip home. We spent a few minutes chatting, during which several other owners pulled up, waited for an open charger, and plugged in as they freed up. I was fascinated to see how many people were already taking advantage of these stations — which can only be used by a single car model from a single manufacturer — and we’re just a few months into production. By the time the Model X is on the road, Tesla could need significantly more of these to keep up with demand, lest we end up with huge crowds of nearly-dead EVs queued up at strip malls around the country. The company is currently planning to deploy around 100 of the stations by 2015, which should lessen (but not entirely eliminate) the need to carefully plan cross-country EV journeys like we did. But after an hour, we were back on the road with about 200 miles of range back in the battery; it’s remarkable how much faster these Superchargers are than the Level 2 system we’d used in Morro Bay. My drive to San Francisco was bittersweet, knowing that I was just a couple hours away from relinquishing a very special car that I can’t afford — and even if I could, I’d be staring down the barrel of a multi-year waiting list with a $5,000 deposit. [Editor's note: Tesla tells me in a follow-up email that wait times have improved to 3-6 months.] No road trip to San Francisco would be complete without a ceremonial drive across the Golden Gate Bridge, and that’s where we wrapped our shoot: on the scenic turnout, surrounded by tourists taking in the magnificent view. Maybe a decade from now, all these parked cars could be electric, I think to myself. Maybe not. It hinges on a lot of money, a lot of infrastructure, and the ability of firms like Tesla to succeed in the face of a brutal auto industry that has a reputation for eating businesses alive. The Model S isn’t perfect. Far from it — and I think that Elon Musk would be the first to admit it. But for a company only ten years old to produce an automobile good enough to convince a Detroit native that this might be the future of transportation? Well, that’s pretty amazing.

One more that could be on its way out? A visit to the doctor's office. That's the vision of a company called Cue, which wants to make at-home medical diagnosis — everything from the flu to vitamin D levels — as common as pregnancy tests. The concept revolves around a small cubic kit, which the company says can use a swab of saliva, nasal fluid, or blood, to discern what's going on in your body. And the product won't just determine if you're sick: it'll also check vitamin or testosterone levels, or help women figure out if it's a good time to try for a baby. In short, Cue is designed to replace the trips you'd take to a doctor or lab by doing some of those same tests at home. The basic hardware is $199 Cue, which hopes to ship its first $199 device to a group of beta testers early next year, is the brainchild of Ayub Khattak — who has a background in mathematics and biochemistry,  and Clint Sever, a product designer and engineer. Five years ago, Khattak was working on a project about genetic barcoding in plants at UCLA, and thought that the same idea could be applied to a miniaturized tester for viruses in humans. The pair decided to take apart a home glucose tester and figure out whether that same basic hardware could extend to other types of tests. That led to the small base-unit reader, which can analyze disposable cartridges that test different bodily fluids. You put a fluid into a cartridge, plug it in, and the Cue base unit delivers test results wirelessly over Bluetooth to an app on your phone. The flu is one of five things Cue plans to assess in its initial model, alongside fertility, testosterone, inflammation, and vitamin D levels. Some of those tests differ from what you'd find in your pharmacy, which typically offer blood-glucose monitors, home drug-testing kits, fertility tests, and kits that check for HIV (which until two years ago required lab work). By comparison, several of the tests Cue's going after have traditionally required a doctor's visit or a trip to a specialty lab. Cue's starting lineup of tests are ""similar in performance"" to their lab counterparts, Khattak says, and in some cases are faster than what's being used in doctor's offices. The flu test, for instance, is three times faster than a conventional one, and the Vitamin D test takes 10 minutes to spit out results. 140 million US doctor visits are for cold and flu ""There are over 140 million doctor visits for cold and flu symptoms every year in the US. In more than 31 million of those visits, the patient has flu,"" Khattak says. ""We want to enable people to get this health information in minutes and, if flu is detected, communicate their result to their doctor who can order a prescription to the local pharmacy."" And because Cue relies on a universal reader to analyze cartridges, it could conceivably be expanded to incorporate additional tests in the future. Cartridges, which are non-reusable, are mostly expected to sell for $20 per five-pack, with the flu test going for $30 for a pack of three. Khattak says the eventual goal is to have both the unit and cartridges subsidized by insurance companies and government health-care programs like Medicare. Right now, Cue is being sold to select buyers without FDA approval, by participating in an agency program that allows exemptions for ""investigational devices"" — meaning the product can't yet be sold in stores.  Of course, Cue isn't the first company trying to transform how and where medical testing happens — though it is among the first to focus on consumers instead of health-care providers.  QuantuMDx, which is backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Clinton Foundation, has developed a portable device that can detect malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, or other STDs in less than 15 minutes using similarly specialized cartridges. Unlike Cue, however, it's been developed for testing in places without Westernized medicine, and plans to eventually test for things like cancer. Apple and Samsung want to track health data too Cue's entry also comes as technology giants like Apple and Samsung are turning attention to health-tracking and its integration with sensor hardware. For Samsung, that's a two-pronged effort to track metrics like heartbeat, blood pressure, and physical activity. The company is also working in SAMI, a cloud-based platform for securely capturing and processing data from all various health-tracking hardware. More recently, Apple announced HealthKit, a backend for tracking fitness data which will work hand-in-hand with a health-tracking app on iOS. HealthKit is expected to be an integral part of the company's wearable device, which is reportedly being announced this October. But not everyone is convinced by the idea of home health-testing devices like Cue. Especially the part about turning the data into something that's actionable. ""A small machine is not going to tell you what it means,"" says Dr. Paul Abramson, a San Francisco physician. ""Say these numbers were accurate. Would they be useful to figure out what to do? Probably not, because it's hard to be objective about yourself when you're sick."" And because Cue has yet to be used by many patients, it's unclear exactly how accurate the device actually is — and the company isn't ready to discuss that, largely because it can't make any claims to accuracy until the product is cleared by the FDA. All Khattak would say is that Cue was ""definitely not less effective"" than standard lab tests, and that the company's been comparing its own results to those done in a lab. ""There's a lot of gray area."" Even so, Abramson suggests that some of the things Cue plans to test for don't yield simple answers, and could require analysis. ""Self-testing at home implies there's a linear [progression]: this means this. That if you just measure it, it will tell you what to do — and very few things like that are true in medicine,"" he says. ""There's a lot of gray area."" That includes testosterone testing, something Abramson argues was created by pharmaceutical companies, and is difficult to analyze because it can differ among patients and vary wildly from day to day. Looking ahead, Cue's founders also hope they can offer some analysis to go along with test results. The company plans to offer suggestions, like exercise tweaks or dietary adjustments, based on a user's health profile.

Now DARPA has announced the plan, which aims to allow soldiers to enter a visualized version of cyberspace to repel enemy attacks, will start being rolled out to the Department of Defense and US military's Cyber Command in October 2017. Plan X's program manager, Frank Pound, says the plan aims to ""get rid of the keyboard"" — rather than requiring computer-literate white hat hackers, DARPA's initiative is looking for a way to allow standard soldiers to defend against computer assaults by using technologies with intuitive interfaces to simplify the process. Pound sees the project as vital for all levels of the military. The program manager recently told the American Forces Press Service that his team was scaling the system to support more than 300,000 users, and that he wanted a Plan X system ""in every military installation, every combat information center on a ship, and at the tactical level in tactical operations centers."". Soldiers will be able to use the Oculus Rift to fight against cyber attacks One of these devices is a holographic touch table. The agency showed off a table-sized touchscreen last year that could map Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals, but the new version is reportedly capable of creating a real-time 3D holographic image that doesn't require glasses to view. Using the table, the US Department of Defense says members of the military can visualize computer networks, interact with their assets, and plan counter-attacks.   DARPA's holographic touch table (DARPA) DARPA has also experimented with the Oculus Rift virtual reality device to allow soldiers to enter cyberspace. Pound says the headset can visualize electronic attacks for regular military officials by removing abstract complexities and presenting only the information required to counter enemy actions. The US Department of Defense distils the concept, describing DARPA's plan as like sending a marine with a weapon in his hand into a firefight in cyberspace. DARPA has likened Plan X to a video game The human element is required, Pound says, because situations could arise that an automated response system cannot plan for. ""We want human beings to be able to step in and answer the really hard questions that computers aren't so good at answering right now."" Humans are also capable of understanding how to limit collateral damage so only an adversary's network is targeted. DARPA has previously compared this on-the-fly assessment — and the entire Plan X project — to a video game. Assets can be ascribed points to show how valuable they are, while Plan X's inventor, Dan Roelker, likened the process of simplifying cyberspace to World of Warcraft. A large budget cut means that although Plan X was announced in 2012, DARPA is only eight months into its ambitious project. The initiative to send soldiers to do battle in cyberspace may sound like a script for a sequel to an '80s cyberpunk movie, but program manager Pound, who describes Plan X as like Google Maps for electronic space, says the initiative could be spun off for civilian use. ""The idea of a virtual world and being able to act with it and walk around in it would translate nicely into Internet terms."" The agency has experience creating technology that gets adopted by civilian consumers — Pound points out that Siri was once a DARPA project, before it was given over to Apple — so civilians might soon also be able to climb inside their home networks.",0.5376909112574353,0.4623090887425647,0.8658570890382024,602,5.0199335548172757,326,6.0705521472392636,0,0,"Science, US & World",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Verge Live on Microsoft’s new CEO Satya Nadella   From: Satya Nadella To: All Employees Date: Feb. 4, 2014 Subject: RE: Satya Nadella – Microsoft’s New CEO   Today is a very humbling day for me. It reminds me of my very first day at Microsoft, 22 years ago. Like you, I had a choice about where to come to work. I came here because I believed Microsoft was the best company in the world. I saw then how clearly we empower people to do magical things with our creations and ultimately make the world a better place. I knew there was no better company to join if I wanted to make a difference. This is the very same inspiration that continues to drive me today. It is an incredible honor for me to lead and serve this great company of ours. Steve and Bill have taken it from an idea to one of the greatest and most universally admired companies in the world. I’ve been fortunate to work closely with both Bill and Steve in my different roles at Microsoft, and as I step in as CEO, I’ve asked Bill to devote additional time to the company, focused on technology and products. I’m also looking forward to working with John Thompson as our new Chairman of the Board. While we have seen great success, we are hungry to do more. Our industry does not respect tradition — it only respects innovation. This is a critical time for the industry and for Microsoft. Make no mistake, we are headed for greater places — as technology evolves and we evolve with and ahead of it. Our job is to ensure that Microsoft thrives in a mobile and cloud-first world. As we start a new phase of our journey together, I wanted to share some background on myself and what inspires and motivates me. Who am I? I am 46. I’ve been married for 22 years and we have 3 kids. And like anyone else, a lot of what I do and how I think has been shaped by my family and my overall life experiences. Many who know me say I am also defined by my curiosity and thirst for learning. I buy more books than I can finish. I sign up for more online courses than I can complete. I fundamentally believe that if you are not learning new things, you stop doing great and useful things. So family, curiosity and hunger for knowledge all define me. Why am I here? I am here for the same reason I think most people join Microsoft — to change the world through technology that empowers people to do amazing things. I know it can sound hyperbolic — and yet it’s true. We have done it, we’re doing it today, and we are the team that will do it again. I believe over the next decade computing will become even more ubiquitous and intelligence will become ambient. The coevolution of software and new hardware form factors will intermediate and digitize — many of the things we do and experience in business, life and our world. This will be made possible by an ever-growing network of connected devices, incredible computing capacity from the cloud, insights from big data, and intelligence from machine learning. This is a software-powered world. It will better connect us to our friends and families and help us see, express, and share our world in ways never before possible. It will enable businesses to engage customers in more meaningful ways. I am here because we have unparalleled capability to make an impact. Why are we here? In our early history, our mission was about the PC on every desk and home, a goal we have mostly achieved in the developed world. Today we’re focused on a broader range of devices. While the deal is not yet complete, we will welcome to our family Nokia devices and services and the new mobile capabilities they bring us. As we look forward, we must zero in on what Microsoft can uniquely contribute to the world. The opportunity ahead will require us to reimagine a lot of what we have done in the past for a mobile and cloud-first world, and do new things. We are the only ones who can harness the power of software and deliver it through devices and services that truly empower every individual and every organization. We are the only company with history and continued focus in building platforms and ecosystems that create broad opportunity. Qi Lu captured it well in a recent meeting when he said that Microsoft uniquely empowers people to ""do more."" This doesn’t mean that we need to do more things, but that the work we do empowers the world to do more of what they care about — get stuff done, have fun, communicate and accomplish great things. This is the core of who we are, and driving this core value in all that we do — be it the cloud or device experiences — is why we are here. What do we do next? To paraphrase a quote from Oscar Wilde — we need to believe in the impossible and remove the improbable. This starts with clarity of purpose and sense of mission that will lead us to imagine the impossible and deliver it. We need to prioritize innovation that is centered on our core value of empowering users and organizations to ""do more."" We have picked a set of high-value activities as part of our One Microsoft strategy. And with every service and device launch going forward we need to bring more innovation to bear around these scenarios. Next, every one of us needs to do our best work, lead and help drive cultural change. We sometimes underestimate what we each can do to make things happen and overestimate what others need to do to move us forward. We must change this. Finally, I truly believe that each of us must find meaning in our work. The best work happens when you know that it's not just work, but something that will improve other people's lives. This is the opportunity that drives each of us at this company. Many companies aspire to change the world. But very few have all the elements required: talent, resources, and perseverance. Microsoft has proven that it has all three in abundance. And as the new CEO, I can’t ask for a better foundation. Let’s build on this foundation together.

""I'll have over a third of my time available to meet with product groups, and it'll be fun to define this next round of products working together.""  ""The opportunity for Microsoft is greater than ever before."" Though Gates has regularly stated that he'd prefer to spend more of his time working on philanthropic projects than Microsoft, Nadella is said to have requested Gates' assistance while stepping into his new role. Gates says that Nadella has the right background to lead Microsoft forward, explaining that Microsoft has large opportunities ahead of it in mobile and cloud computing — the latter an area that Nadella has plenty of experience in. ""The opportunity for Microsoft is greater than ever before,"" Gates says. Gates will be succeeded as chairman by John Thompson, who joined Microsoft's board in February of 2012. Thompson is currently the CEO of Virtual Instruments and previously served as CEO and chairman of Symantec. Thompson's appointment also marks a major change for Microsoft: Gates has served as the company's chairman since 1981, well before he stepped down as CEO. The leadership change comes at a critical point for Microsoft, and it's clear that both Gates and Nadella know it. The PC industry is slowing down; now they'll need to help Microsoft find greater success in mobile and the cloud from their new roles.

The claim, filed Friday in New York by an attorney leading a class action lawsuit on behalf of ebooks customers in 33 states, stems from the US Justice Department's successful antitrust lawsuit against Apple that took place in the summer of 2013. Using evidence presented during the course of that trial last year, attorney Steve Berman begins by arguing that Apple owes American ebooks customers a bare minimum of $231 million in damages, and probably far more money than that.  bare minimum of $231 million in damages The $231 million figure comes from an estimate provided by one of Apple's witnesses during the trial, who said that Apple's deal with publishers to use an ""agency model"" for pricing ebooks –  an agreement under which publishers set the final price of ebooks that Apple would charge consumers, and Apple took 30 percent of each sale – resulted in a 14.9 percent increase in sales dollars. This increase came about because Apple charged an average of price of $12.99 for each new ebook, higher than the average $9.99 previously charged when Amazon was the major ebooks retailer and could lower the price for consumers. But Berman goes even further, pointing out in his new claim that his witness, a Stanford economist, estimated that the increase in ebooks sales was 18.1 percent, or a total $280 million worth of sales. Berman says that the judge should force Apple to pay triple this amount so that it can be divided effectively between the various states and consumers suing Apple for damages. That may sound like a lot for most of us, but if the judge agrees and forces Apple to turn over that amount, it would be equal to just 0.5 percent of the cash on hand Apple reported at the end of last year, as Bloomberg observes. Apple hasn't commented on the latest filing but it is appealing the original ruling in the case.",0.5454455550539552,0.4545544449460448,0.8473389901598353,349,4.7421203438395416,206,5.4466019417475726,0,0,"Apple, Business, Tech",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

A big part of that plan involves significantly upgrading its services in New York and Los Angeles under a new brand by the end of the year. The company unveiled the plan during an unusual 90-minute earnings call on Thursday. The new service is tentatively called ""TWC Maxx"" and the end result, according to the company, is that internet speeds will be bumped across the board. Time Warner Cable's ""standard"" tier will increase from a dismal 15 / 1 Mbps connection to 50 / 5, and ""turbo"" will go from 20 / 2 to 100 / 10 Mbps. For those with a real need for bandwidth, the ""ultimate"" tier will max out at 300 / 20 Mbps.Speed increases (without corresponding fare hikes) are always welcome, but the real issue that many TWC customers have faced are inconsistent speeds. Hopefully, the company's ""revitalization"" plan will address this: in a press release, TWC says it will go through and analyze each and every connection site (or hub). These hubs serve as an access point for modems to access the network, and when they're overloaded by activity in the area, performance drops. Work is starting first in West Hollywood and Costa Mesa, California, as well as parts of Woodside, Queens, and Staten Island. Beyond network improvements, the company says it'll make sure customers in Maxx areas have new modems and wireless gateways. Maxx improvements are scheduled to be completed in LA and NYC by the end of the year, with 75 percent of TWC's total coverage area upgraded by 2015 and 2016. ""With TWC Maxx, we’re going to essentially reinvent the TWC experience market-by-market."" Newly-minted CEO Robert Marcus added on the earnings call that Maxx means ""more reliable, better quality video, all digital signals and better, newer HD set-top boxes."" That includes continuing the rollout of a ""cloud"" TV guide that — finally — offers a faster, native 16:9 HD interface. And they're going to offer a new box with 1TB of storage and six different tuners. Lastly, the plan calls for improved customer service. Marcus said during the call that ""the fact is that no one in the communication services space gets great marks for service — we intend to be the first."" The rebranding might work side-by-side with these changes. The new name for the residential cable services is reminiscent of Comcast's ""Xfinity"" brand and Cablevision's ""Optimum"" service, and it's likely designed to show that it's a different and better TWC than you knew before. The news follows a rough year for Time Warner Cable. The company's subscriber numbers were described by the CFO as ""dismal."" It lost 833,000 cable TV subscribers over the year compared to 532,000 the year prior — a result which was due in part to a spat with CBS. Rival Charter made a public bid for the company earlier this month, and alongside the offer executives like COO John Bickham trashed TWC's management, saying that they ""failed to be a competitive company."" Part of the criticism targeted the firm's limited technology investments. TWC thinks Charter's bid undervalues the company, and the CEO said that Charter's executives ""see a chance to force a trade before the public realizes what we can achieve with our standalone plan."" In either case, it seems the takeover attempt has pushed TWC to be more aggressive with its network upgrades.",0.3857131385243271,0.6142868614756729,0.8540543876050098,608,4.9029605263157894,362,5.9364640883977904,0,0,"Business, Home, Tech",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

As first reported by TechCrunch, Twitter has advertised for a senior manager for commerce partnerships and a product marketing manager for the commerce team. Both will work with Nathan Hubbard, the former Ticketmaster president whom Twitter brought on last summer in an effort to let merchants sell products inside of tweets. Turning Twitter into a marketplace would provide the company with a new revenue stream, in the form of commissions on sales, and a better understanding of its users, which would benefit its advertisers. On Friday, Re/code posted a storyboard of a potential user interface for Twitter commerce created by e-commerce site The Fancy. The storyboard, which was posted to a public page on The Fancy's website, shows a mock-up of an iPhone screen with a Twitter card that expands to include a button that says ""Buy with Fancy."" After tapping it, the user would see a ""sale screen"" with more information about the product, followed by a checkout screen within the app. The Fancy is one of several companies Twitter has met with as it considers different approaches to bringing retail to the timeline, The Verge has learned. But the storyboard's design came from The Fancy, not Twitter itself.  Still, the fact that Twitter is now building its team in the open suggest that its long-awaited take on e-commerce may be coming shortly. The company's recent embrace of the continuous redesign give it the flexibility to launch experiments easily, and the job listings say that managing beta tests will be part of the new hires' responsibilities. Twitter declined to comment on the recent commerce reports.

Reuters says that Sprint's chairman Masayoshi Son and CEO Dan Hesse held talks with the commission last week to discuss the company's plans to launch an acquisition bid for T-Mobile. At the meeting, Wheeler was apparently skeptical about the chances of a merger between America's third- and fourth-largest carriers passing regulatory hurdles. This echoes comments made by the both the FCC and Department of Justice (DOJ) over the past year or so, and also matches reports of a similar meeting between Sprint executives and the DOJ last week. According to Reuters, the purpose of Sprint's recent battery of talks is to implore officials to approach a review of the acquisition bid with open minds. It appears extremely likely that Sprint will launch a bid despite the odds against regulatory approval being stacked against the carrier. If the bid does come through, Sprint and T-Mobile will argue that the acquisition will help the newly merged carriers to compete with industry giants AT&T and Verizon, while the DOJ and FCC currently hold the position that a four-carrier system is important for maintaining a competitive market for consumers.

A new class The split creates separate classes of stock for the split: one with voting power and another without. Those stocks will then get separate ticker symbols, says the Associated Press, something that could lead to different prices based on the company's performance. Those two classes are also separate from a third class of shares owned by Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, worth 10 votes apiece on any official company business. Google shareholders originally approved plans for a stock split back in June 2012, though the plan hit a snag when a subgroup of shareholders sued the company. That complaint claimed that the split would have diluted the power of the company's shareholders, while shoring up control for Brin and Page. The two sides settled last June, with part of that agreement requiring Google to compensate shareholders if the price of the non-voting shares diminishes beyond a certain threshold within its first year.

He appears to be the first person in world history to receive a jail sentence for making 3D-printed firearms.  ""flaunted his skills and knowledge."" Imura was previously an employee at the Shonan Institute of Technology, according to The Japan Times. He was arrested in May after posting videos and blueprints of his 3D-printed weapons online. Police reportedly seized five plastic weapons from his home. A video uploaded to file-sharing websites almost a year ago, allegedly created by Imura, shows the creation and firing of a 3D-printed ""Zig Zag"" revolver capable of firing six .38 caliber bullets, as Wired previously reported. While the prosecution in Imura's case called for a three-and-a-half year prison sentence, the judge certainly didn't go easy on Imura, saying he ""flaunted his skills and knowledge and attempted to make gun controls toothless."" Japan has notoriously strict gun regulations, but Imura's case is not the first time in the world that authorities have tried to crack down on the burgeoning 3D-printed gun movement: police in the UK seized suspected 3D-printed gun components almost exactly a year ago, only to find out that they were likely just spare parts for the printer.

Scott Robert Hansen, 37, pleaded guilty to three counts in a Brisbane court this week, admitting to possessing images of child sexual abuse and sending lewd pictures of himself to Sweetie. Workers from the charity Terre des Hommes went undercover in chatrooms for ten weeks last year, posing as Philippine girls and using Sweetie to lure potential predators via webcam. The group says it never actively approached predators, waiting instead for them to contact Sweetie, and that its researchers stopped all conversations once a user offered the young girl money to perform sexual acts. The goal, they say, was to shed light on a growing form of webcam-based child exploitation, which has snared thousands of victims in the Philippines alone.  More than 20,000 users from 71 countries approached Sweetie with requests for obscene performances during the ten-week operation, of which 1,000 were identified. Terre des Hommes passed their names on to authorities in the UK, US, and other countries, though Interpol has raised concerns over non-governmental organizations spearheading criminal investigations. The operation led to the arrest of 46 people in Australia, and other investigations are ongoing. BBC News has obtained a transcript of Hansen's conversation with Sweetie, whom he took to be nine-years-old. The chat logs show that the man asked Sweetie if she'd ever seen a naked man before, before turning the camera on himself and performing a sexual act. An anonymous operator tells BBC News that Hansen was ""probably not the most serious, not even amongst the most serious"" of predators he encountered during the sting. ""Some of the men we interacted with literally give me nightmares,"" the operator added. This week's conviction comes just days after Lemz, the Amsterdam-based agency that created Sweetie, won the top prize at this year's Dutch Design Awards.

The 911 outage affected 11 million people; in Washington state, every single person was affected. And in a new report investigating the causes of the outage, the FCC found this: ""It could have been prevented. But it was not."" According to the report, the outage was caused by a simple coding error. A Colorado-based company, Intrado, Inc., which many service providers rely on for 911 infrastructure services, failed to properly route calls to emergency responders because of a bug in its software. Essentially, the coding error caused the system to stop giving unique IDs to 911 callers, and instead began counting them, one after the other, in one large set. When the set reached its pre-determined limit, the calls stopped coming through. Intrado's system, because of the coding error, failed to realize there was a widespread problem. The resulting 911 outage disconnected services in North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, California, Minnesota, and Florida, but the worst problems were in Washington state, where every emergency service system was affected to various degrees. The outage was caused by a simple coding error One of the most striking details from the report, which relied on ""confidential reports, public comments, and related documents,"" found that the system could have been fixed almost as soon as the outage started. Intrado operates a so-called ""redundant hub"" in Miami, where emergency calls can be re-routed. But because the problems were not swiftly identified, the outage went on for six hours. When the calls were finally sent through Miami, service was immediately restored. The FCC takes several lessons from the outage and followup investigation. As The Verge highlighted this month, the seven-state outage may have been an outlier in size, but hardly in type. Similar 911 outages are more frequent than many people would expect, and the FCC points out in its report that ""sunny day outages"" — where external problems aren't the cause — seem to be on the rise. Partly, the problem stems from attempts to reconcile aging emergency infrastructure with new mobile technology. Both carriers and 911 centers may be taking shortcuts when setting up their emergency systems. While it's recommended that systems have multiple failsafes to work as backup in case of problems, many don't, opening the door for ""single-point"" failures, where a minor problem at one point may cause the entire system to fail. When multiple carriers outsource their 911 responsibilities to the same third-party, as happened in the April outage, the problems can be exacerbated: communication between so many companies becomes a challenge, and it becomes less clear who needs to be held accountable in an emergency. The FCC's report ends on a less than hopeful note: ""As the Nation transitions to new methods of communications, we need to take care to ensure that our inherent trust in the 911 system does not get lost in that transition.""",0.3056076894966193,0.6943923105033807,0.8738254986828423,509,5.1493123772102161,286,6.2132867132867133,0,0,"Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Letterman and Saturday Night Live formed the subversive bookends for the week: Dave appearing nightly Monday through Thursday, with SNL’s Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo finishing it off on the weekend.  At 18, I went off to college and became a regular viewer. Each weeknight my three roommates and I insisted on taking over the dorm’s TV room. Those who stayed were treated to the wonders of Letterman, and sometimes a slice of pizza. Our little posse grew over time to include more converts. Eventually, everyone knew that the 12:30AM time slot was reserved for Dave. Letterman wasn’t Last-Exit-to-Brooklyn subversive, but for a white middle-class kid living in a midwestern suburb, Dave felt dangerous. Unpredictable. From the sweet confusion of Larry Bud Melman to Chris Elliot’s hilarious characters like Guy Under The Seats. Stupid Human Tricks. Dave’s tense, combative flirtations with Madonna. Andy Kaufman getting slapped by wrestler Jerry Lawler. Crispin Glover’s bizarre ""I can kick"" appearance rivaled only by a detached Joaquin Phoenix some 22 years later. Anything could happen — that’s why we watched.    Dave didn’t give a shit about celebrity, unable (or unwilling) to hide his irreverence for people like Paris Hilton. Watch the first six minutes of the interview above — it’s all you need to know about the man, his humor, and his legacy. When Johnny Carson — Letterman’s hero — died in 2005, Dave opened the show by reading a collection of jokes Carson had been faxing him since retirement. It was bittersweet and funny, and gave me, the viewer, rare insight into Dave’s intensely private personal life. After commercial, Letterman explained what it was like to learn of Carson’s passing. ""I had this strange feeling that I had been through this before,"" he said. ""I was nearly this sad when the guy retired as when you find out that he’s actually passed away because that part of our lives…"" has come to an end, he was about to say. I haven’t watched Dave regularly for years, but his continuity was reassuring. Knowing he was out there was enough to maintain a connection to my 15-year-old immortal self. I haven’t watched the final show yet. What he said last night isn’t important to me. What’s important is that he’s already said it, bringing that part of my life to an end.  And so began David Letterman's foray into late night television from February 1st, 1982 — over 33 years ago — featuring Bill Murray, Mr. Wizard, and a lot of welding (seriously). Though some of the references are dated, it's surprising how much of the show still holds up. It's funny. It's weird. It's brilliant. ""So whether you’re ordering diapers and a big-screen television from Amazon, fresh produce from D’Agostino, a chef-made prepared meal from Gourmet Garage or cupcakes from Billy’s Bakery, we will get all of the items right to your door in lightning-fast speeds,"" said Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations. ""We are launching delivery from local stores through Prime Now in Manhattan today and will add local stores in other cities where we offer Prime Now soon."" The man who landed a gyrocopter on the West Lawn of Washington DC's Capitol Building last month is facing up to nine-and-a-half years in prison. 61-year-old Douglas Hughes, who organized the flight to protest corruption in the US government, has today been indicted of six charges, including operating as an airman without an airman's certificate, violating aircraft registration requirements, and violating national defense airspace. Take today's announcement of Google's Live Cases, for instance. You pop a special case on the back of your newer-model Android phone — there's just a Skrillex case available right now, but presumably there'll be more — and the phone recognizes it, automatically customizing itself with special wallpaper and access to custom content. It's cool, it's clever. But Nokia did it first. ""To capture the Earth images, Google and Skrillex launched a custom-designed balloon satellite named after Skrillex’s dog, Nanou.""   Wait. What?

Hathaway stars in Voltage Pictures' Colossal, a monster movie currently playing at Cannes Film Festival, in which the American actress finds her mind somehow connected to the brain of a Godzilla-esque figure that's flattening Japan's capital city. While Colossal certainly isn't the first movie to feature a king-sized kaiju, Toho — which created and owns the character — says Voltage is knowingly using references to Godzilla to make the movie look more enticing to buyers on the festival circuit. Colossal's director said it would be ""a serious Godzilla movie."" Toho's complaint, filed on Tuesday in California federal court, says Voltage is ""brazenly producing, advertising, and selling an unauthorized Godzilla film of their own."" The Japanese company points specifically to comments made by Colossal's writer and director Nacho Vigalondo in August 2014, in which he said his film would be ""a serious Godzilla movie,"" but promised it would be ""the cheapest Godzilla movie ever."" Toho also claims that Colossal used images from the recent Godzilla reboot as part of a pitch email sent to potential investors, sales agents, and distributors, and argues that Voltage used the copyrighted line ""Tokyo is under attack by Godzilla"" in its Cannes sales booklet. When does a monster become a kaiju? And when does a kaiju become a Godzilla? Certainly other movies have walked the line between giant spiky atomic dinosaur monster and Godzilla with greater care, but Toho says it's just doing what Voltage would do.

The Skrillex Live Case connects to your phone to bring you VIP access to Skrillex content and a companion live wallpaper that extends its design onto the screen. Skrillex's lifelong fascination with space Wait, this sounds like something a little more involved than just a case. Apparently, Skrillex made a custom .jpg file just for me, his no. 1 fan, to put on the home screen of the Android phone I don't have. How thoughtful of him! Do tell me more about Skrillex's lifelong fascination with space, though. I don't care much about this phone case/wallpaper combo, but I'd love to know more about things Skrillex likes. The companion live wallpaper updates over the course of the day showing stunning images of Earth shot from the stratosphere. At night, it changes to display constellations visible from your current location. Whoa, that's actually ... pretty cool. It's like having the ISS live TV special on your phone! Too bad I don't have an Android phone, I might get this just for funsies. To capture the Earth images, Google and Skrillex launched a custom-designed balloon satellite named after Skrillex’s dog, Nanou.  Wait. What? Google launched a satellite specifically for Skrillex? And they named it after his dog? There is an object in orbit around our planet right now named after Skrillex's dog?

He deserves every success that ever comes to him. Here's a video of Skrillex explaining the creative journey that led to him designing an Android phone. Please watch and enjoy it.

It's even worse when a service you're used to suddenly gets socialized in a way that is unavoidable. A recent example of that is Google requiring a Google+ account for anyone to comment on a YouTube video or sign up for a new Google account. It seemed arbitrary and artificial, and the company's at least partially relented on the rule for people who were making new accounts. But what if the social networking features that were seemingly tacked on ended up being the thing that kept people coming back? You can now play on your computer too A year and a half into its existence, QuizUp — a trivia app that lets you compete with strangers from around the world — says that's just what's happened. As a result, it's introducing social networking features to keep users around after they're done playing. It's also laying the groundwork to expand beyond trivia into other games. But for starters, it's debuting profile pages, the ability to follow other users and topic pages around quiz genres that feel more like tiny Reddit communities than something associated with casual gaming. QuizUp is also launching a desktop version of the service that you can play inside your web browser.   From the outside, QuizUp looks like one more faddish game that grew quickly and raised a ton of money only to fade into obscurity, forcing it to come up with this new strategy. In 2012, a Pictionary-like game named Draw Something rocketed to 50 million downloads in less than two months, and was snapped up by Zynga for $180 million. It promptly fell out of the App Store charts, and soon Zynga's stock price had lost half its value. More recently, King.com went public on the strength of its signature hit, Candy Crush. Investors are so skeptical of its future that King is now the fourth-most-shorted stock on the New York Stock Exchange. As a private company, QuizUp has a bit more room to maneuver. According to the company, its move into social networking is simply a reaction to the way QuizUp's users were already behaving. Fans have started spending as much time chatting with one another and on the service's group discussion boards as they are challenging one another to rounds of trivia, which only run about a minute to a minute and a half in length. Those places that were once envisioned as a side feature have morphed into the places where people gravitate. Now the company wants users to stick around even longer — even if it's not playing the company's games. Facebook is ""kind of creepy."" ""When you think of the social networking landscape, there isn't a good place where you can meet new people. Facebook is all about connecting with existing friends, so it's kind of weird when somebody [you don't know] adds you — it's kind of creepy,"" says Thor Fridriksson, QuizUp's founder and CEO. ""Here, you can safely get to know new people, and we think doing that through interests is the way to go. We're trying to create communities where people play each other, and interact with each other.""  This is Kimberley, another player I got matched with based on the two of us liking similar topics. Fridriksson likes to point to one instance of this happening when two users from completely different parts of the world began chatting with one another after trading victories in Lord of the Rings trivia. They got to talking to one another and eventually decided to meet in real life. They later got married. ""For the new QuizUp, we thought, ‘Could this become something more than a popular trivia game?'"" Fridriksson says. ""We could use shared interests like games and challenges as an icebreaker, and make it easy to connect to each other."" To help users begin exploring the new features, QuizUp is taking people's existing topics of interest and putting them in a feed. If there's a new item posted to one of those topic pages, you see it in the home feed. The same goes for if you start following people.   Trivia could soon be just one of several games  The new platform will allow QuizUp to expand beyond quizzes and into other types of entertainment, Fridriksson says.  ""The trivia itself is an evergreen thing. We will start to add more game modes, and other parts of entertainment connected to the topics,"" he says. ""I think that what we want to do, and our vision going forward, is connecting people with shared interests. We have built a platform we can iterate on."" That could eventually include things like a Facebook-like news feed, and what Fridriksson only referred to as ""procured, good quality content."" The company's also ditching in-app purchases inside of QuizUp in favor of creating sponsored trivia and topic pages that Fridriksson says everyone will be able to use, instead of just allowing people with disposable income to improve their score (the company previously sold experience point boosters to users, which ranged from $1.99 to $5.99). QuizUp became an overnight success in 2013, gaining 1 million users in its first week. At the time, its parent company, Plain Vanilla Games, had just 12 employees. In the year and a half since, it has raised $27 million and increased the size of its team to 90. Most of those employees work in engineering or moderation — user profiles were overwhelmed with lewd photos after they launched. Moderation will only become important as the company invites users to share photos and links. QuizUp's popularity ratings have plummeted While Fridriksson says it still manages to bring in about 30,000 new players a day, QuizUp has rarely broken into the top 500 most-downloaded apps on iOS this year. Meanwhile, fellow trivia app Trivia Crack has been a top 10 mainstay for much of the year. Fridriksson insists that it's unfair to compare the two given QuizUp's move into social networking. ""There are lots of cool trivia games, but Trivia Crack is just like the opposite to us,"" he says. ""It has five or six categories. They're not about communities, and not about getting to know people. But [it's] a great game, and there's absolutely room for more than one trivia game."" Whether QuizUp's network features will help it climb back atop the charts remains to be seen. In the interim, Fridriksson believes the most important challenge is keeping people coming back in a way that is not annoying or scummy. That's been a tall order for just about any game that are not named Minecraft — even some of the more well known ones. ""You don't see everyone playing Angry Birds. In some ways, that's why we're making the change,"" he says. ""We want to be more of a daily habit.""",0.5735644031483658,0.42643559685163424,0.5204618316397723,1166,4.7487135506003426,578,5.8494809688581313,0,6,"Apps, Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Tech",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

These games develop fervent, hardcore fans who become so good that it's no fun to play unless you have a few hours a day to spend honing your skills. Last year's Titanfall was one of the rare exceptions, an FPS where even newbies could jump in giant robot suits and get in a few kills. The upcoming Splatoon looks to take things a step further: it's a competitive third-person shooter where you play as strange squid creatures who spray ink in order to conquer territory, and it manages to make the genre more accessible without taking out any of the fun.  But the most surprising thing might be that Splatoon is made by Nintendo, and available exclusively on the Wii U. ""It's not necessarily that we started from the point of, 'Okay, let's make a shooter for people who are unfamiliar with shooters,'"" says producer Hisashi Nogami. ""But when we decided to go with this idea of spraying ink to capture territory, we realized that we were making something that those people could get into and feel like they were contributing to their team's victory. That's something that we're really pleased with."" Splatoon features a single-player campaign and a one-on-one local multiplayer mode, but the real heart of the experience is the online play. Here, two teams of four compete with one another to take control of a level. This is done by spraying ink: each team has a color, and whichever manages to cover more of the map by the time the round ends is the winner. As you play, you can upgrade to new, better weapons — including a particularly satisfying giant paint roller — and gear that makes you faster or gives your guns a bit more punch. One of the defining aspects of the game is its unique sense of movement. The characters in Splatoon are sort of were-squid creatures, able to transform from a humanoid to a squid at the push of a button. In human form they can shoot guns and navigate tricky jumps, while squids can speed through like-colored ink to surprise enemies and refill your ink reserves. According to Nogami, this unique, somewhat strange set-up is part of the reason why Nintendo decided to build a brand new franchise, instead of simply creating something like Super Mario Paintball. ""We started from a point where we wanted to make a new game and a new play experience,"" he explains. ""And once we started to decide on the elements — from the characters to the world — we realized that this was going to be its own thing, and not, for example, something in the Mario series."" Splatoon represents a number of important shifts for Nintendo. Not only is it a brand new franchise in a genre that's new for the company, but it is also the most online-focused game Nintendo has ever made. The company has been infamously slow to adapt to the internet, and while games like Mario Kart 8 have dabbled with online play and DLC, Splatoon is the first major step — Nintendo even has a schedule of free, post-launch content planned, to keep players interested with new maps and gear. One of the main reasons the game is so focused on online, Nogami says, actually has to do with the Wii U’s unique controller. The development team really wanted every player to use a Gamepad, which provides a very helpful map so you can see which areas are controlled by which team. And since the Wii U console can only support one Gamepad at present, this simply wasn’t possible to do in a traditional, local multiplayer game. ""We realized we were making a game in which eight players would be playing in a competitive atmosphere online,"" he says. But even though it's a big departure in many ways, Splatoon is also a game that definitely feels like it was made by Nintendo. It's bright and colorful, with action that feels perfectly fine-tuned, and characters that are full of personality. It also doesn't feel like any other shooter out there, in the same way that Smash Bros. feels completely different from other fighting games, while still maintaining that familiar Nintendo charm. And, just like Smash Bros., it's a game you can pick up and enjoy even if you don't really understand what you're doing — but if you are already a fan of shooters, there's a lot to dig into. ""In creating Splatoon, we did want to make a game that people familiar with shooters would enjoy and feel satisfied with,"" says Nogami. ""But we did also want to make an experience that would be welcoming to players new to the genre.""

Presenter Kevin McKeever, who is remaking 1980’s cartoon Robotech into a feature film produced by Sony, just finished his Powerpoint full of tips for seeking out internships and getting a foot in the studio door. The questioner, however, wanted to know when she could have a meeting about licensing out Robotech characters to her T-shirt company for mass production. Two other questioners asked if McKeever would consider moving all of Robotech’s animation production to their studios based in Shanghai. This past weekend saw Shanghai’s first Comic Con, and the city is still figuring out what to do with it. The audience is loosely divided into two groups: fans, who came for a chance to be a part of the Comic Con community, and business people, who think they smell a potential to make some money off this. The two types awkwardly mingle in the expo space — one in meticulously primped cosplay outfits, the other in business casual. The walls of Shanghai Comic Con are draped with warning signs: half telling fans to keep their hands to themselves, that ""Cosplay Is Not Consent,"" the other half telling the business types who to call if they spot any intellectual property rights violations. For those involved in bringing American pop culture to China, business is booming. On the showroom floor, American heroes are out en masse: Batman, Spiderman, and even Captain America himself appear on posters or as the costumes of many Comic Con goers. Thanks to some big-budget Chinese co-production deals — Transformers 4 and Ironman 3, most notably — a number of American blockbusters have had massive success in mainland China. With Ironman 3, not only did the film avoid government censorship, it actually had several minutes added to its mainland China release where some Chinese film stars made an appearance in a bid to boost domestic ticket sales — and it worked.   Japanese pop culture hasn’t been as lucky. Anime and manga, the lifeblood of much of Asia’s comic book culture, don’t mesh well with China’s strict media laws, which favor safe, non-provocative content. Just last month, a government document circulated online listing 62 popular manga and anime titles, including the extremely popular Sailor Moon, Naruto, and One Piece, identifying the works as ""violent"" or ""vulgar"" and recommending their censorship. Last fall, some state papers decried a Japanese ""cultural invasion"" of China via anime cartoons, and recommended that they be banned from the already heavily censored Chinese internet. Censorship and co-productions make for an awkward showing at Comic Con — leaving Chinese animators and filmmakers to pick up the slack. A few Chinese companies — video hosting site Tudou and electronics company LeTV — hosted booths on the main exhibition floor, but nobody showed up to Comic Con dressed as a TV or a buffering video. The only Chinese character on exhibition was Tuzki, the emoji rabbit. Tuzki had its own stall, bedecked with signs exclaiming ""Tuzki: Icon of the internet generation, star of emoticons."" Try as Tuzki might, Shanghai Comic Con was a thoroughly American pop culture affair. When it came time for the cosplay competition (the grand finale event on the second, and last, day of the convention), Marvel and DC characters hit the stage in force, as did some wildcards — Princess Amidala from Star Wars Episode I and one of the non-Robocop robots from Robocop. But just a couple of Japanese characters made an appearance, and Chinese characters barely showed at all. Looking toward next year’s Comic Con, it seems a stretch to think much will change. Chinese companies have grown comfortable with co-financing deals on international blockbusters, and there is too much money to be made to risk shaking things up. And since President Xi Jinping came into office in 2012, China’s media environment has moved in one direction: toward greater censorship, especially of foreign media. It might not be good news for China’s comic book fans or the domestic animation industry, both of which are increasingly cut off from a potential goldmine of talent and inspiration across the Sea of Japan. The two men who asked Kevin McKeever about relocating Robotech’s animation production to Shanghai were disappointed by his response — a previous Robotech film, released in 2013, was outsourced to an animation production company in Ecuador, which meant dealing with fewer (or at least different) production hurdles. But not all hope is lost — Chinese companies may not get to help produce the movie, and Chinese cinema goers may not get to see it, but there’s a pretty good chance they’ll get some T-shirts out of it. So perhaps Shanghai Comic Con served its purpose after all. Correction: Final paragraph updated with correct version of Robotech that was outsourced.  It wouldn’t be a Shanghai event without plenty of selfie sticks on display. One of the cosplay finalists in action. Ultron rocked out on stage. Ultron meets American Apparel. A thoroughly blinged-out stormtrooper. Somebody has to protect all of those helmets. Some of the costumes were a bit remixed. After Instagram was blocked last fall, Chinese photosharing apps cropped up to fill its space. Tuzki: icon of the internet generation, star of emoticons. This was Shanghai’s first Comic Con, which aims to be an annual event.

Academy Award-nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins will be shooting the film for director Denis Villeneuve, marking the third collaboration between the two filmmakers (they also worked on Prisoners and Sicario, which just premiered at the Cannes Film Festival). When people talk about the stunning visuals, textures, and look of the original Blade Runner, it's often director Ridley Scott and his meticulous attention to detail that get the credit — and while Scott's impact can't be overstated, it's the incredibly talented artists behind the scenes that helped craft that vision and make it a reality. In the original, legendary director of photography Jordan Cronenweth shot the film, imbuing it with the melancholy atmosphere and look that inspired a generation of sci-fi filmmakers.  Deakins is one of the most spectacular cinematographers to ever touch a camera For the sequel we'll be getting Deakins, who is straight-up one of the most spectacular directors of photography to ever touch a camera. Going through Deakins' credits is basically like reading a list of The Most Beautiful Movies You've Ever Seen: Skyfall, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, The Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking. There's also his extensive collaboration with Joel and Ethan Coen — Deakins shot Barton Fink, The Hudsucker Proxy, O Brother, Where Art Thou and a number of other films — as well as his gorgeous work in Angelina Jolie's Unbroken. Deakins has proven to be a forward-thinking technologist as well, adopting digital color timing well ahead of his contemporaries, and making the jump to shooting with digital cameras seamlessly without sacrificing beauty or image quality. While there are still thousands of unanswered questions about the Blade Runner sequel — most importantly, Do we really need it? — the question of whether the movie will look stunning or not has been definitively answered. The film won't start shooting until the summer of 2016 so we'll have to wait to see how it all comes together, but in the meantime do yourself a favor: go to Deakins' IMDB page, find every movie you haven't seen, and start watching.

I took the first step towards a smart home about 8 years ago when I installed a handful of Z-Wave light switches and sensors. I’ve been using Sonos speakers to stream audio into every room of my house for about six years. I’ve watched with unyielding interest over the last year as Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Samsung all embraced home automation, but I’ve only recently discovered the product that will take it mainstream: Amazon’s Echo — a Trojan Horse that can also order Trojans. Echo’s ability to control smart gear in the home has expanded quickly and broadly since launch. It now supports Hue and WeMo devices, with IFTTT scripting support that expands functionality to devices like Google's Nest. And as of this week, Echo now supports Wink-compatible products, too. I love smart devices but my family hates them. And really, I can’t blame them. I’m happy to pull out my smartphone, launch an app, and navigate to the ""ground floor"" to shut off my entry lights. My family just wants a switch on the wall. Sure, they’re dullards, and dare I say, laggards — the kind of humans that might cause you to scream Luddites! at a LAN party. But they’re also right. Fact is, most smart devices aren’t as easy and convenient to use as the dumb devices they try to replace. If you want to understand the folly of the Internet of Things then look no further than home automation. Take the Hue light bulb, for example. It’s far more costly and cumbersome to control than a traditional bulb and switch. For $200 you get three wireless bulbs that you can turn purple when it’s about to rain, amongst other tricks. But they don’t work when someone turns them off using the ol’ wall switch instead of the app. That’s where Echo comes in. Chris Ziegler and I have been commiserating over our smart home woes for years. He recently fitted his entire home with Hue bulbs. Here’s what he had to say about living with Alexa on Wednesday: ""With the Echo, I quite literally don’t touch light switches anymore. 'Alexa, turn off the living room lights' gets the job done. It’s one of those exceedingly rare, legitimate Jetsons moments."" That’s a big deal. Voice control is faster than launching an app and more convenient than getting up to hit a switch. And best of all it works the same for all members of the house. Amazon has quietly figured out that automation of a family home requires a voice communications hub, not a tablet on the wall or a bunch of smartphones with apps that all have to be managed independently. Google’s Nest and Apple HomeKit devices support voice commands via watches and smartphones — the most personal of all devices. Echo is shared. It's communal. Its far-field microphone and omni-directional speaker are designed for use by everyone in the same room — accepting commands from me just as readily as my six-year old. This small yet significant adjustment in thinking puts every smart home device within reach of the whole family. And with the biggest tech companies in the world now working on smart home solutions, there’s really nothing to stop home automation from finally going mainstream. If only Echo was sold in Europe and worked natively with Sonos, Apple HomeKit, and Nest, then I’d be all set. Maybe next year.  When it comes to the Ghostbusters reboot, we've already seen the reimagined Ecto-1 car and an annotated snap of the new proton pack from director Paul Feig. Now though, we've got our first glimpse of all four 'busters wearing their new uniforms. Samsung will move up the new Note's launch by a few weeks in order to avoid competing for attention with the announcement of the latest iPhone. Apple is expected to refresh its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus with new 6S variants, and it usually hosts its big autumn event just after IFA — so it's understandable that Samsung would seek to secure a slightly longer hype window for one of its own halo products.

Apple is expected to refresh its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus with new 6S variants, and it usually hosts its big autumn event just after IFA — so it's understandable that Samsung would seek to secure a slightly longer hype window for one of its own halo products. Samsung did something similar last summer by launching the well received, but short-lived Galaxy Alpha in August, exploiting a traditionally quiet time for new product releases. The fifth Galaxy Note is likely to follow a similar trajectory: launched in the midst of summer and then featured as part of Samsung's IFA exhibition.

Unlike iOS 7 or 8, which introduced massive revisions to how the platform looked and worked under the hood, iOS 9 is a subtler update. Still, it does have a number of new features for the iPhone and iPad that should make the platform easier and more efficient to use. Update: Read the Apple iOS 9 review. It’s been available for developers to test for some time now, but if you're daring, Apple just released a public beta that anyone can install. Apple's beta software isn’t like the some of the other beta software you may have used in that it’s usually a “true” beta that still has bugs and crashes that can seriously keep you from relying on it from day to day. The company warns against installing it on your main device, and you should heed that advice. We've gone ahead and bit the bullet and installed it on an iPhone 6 Plus and iPad Air 2. Unsurprisingly, there are a number of rough edges and wonky areas that Apple will likely clean up by the time this reaches final release in the fall. There are also a bunch of incompatibilities with third-party apps that haven't yet been updated to support the new platform. But overall, there’s a lot to like, even in these early stages. Here are our early impressions. Visually, iOS 9 doesn't look much different than iOS 8, and an untrained eye will have difficulty telling them apart at first. Apple has largely been tweaking and refining the look of iOS since version 7’s major revamp two years ago, and iOS 9 does include some small changes. The most notable one is the system-wide use of Apple’s own San Francisco font, which replaces the Helvetica Neue it used before. San Francisco first debuted on the Apple Watch this year, and it’s a clean, readable font that works well at a variety of sizes. Most people probably won’t be able to spot the difference between Helvetica Neue and San Francisco, but it is pleasant to look at. Other minor (or major, depending on who you ask) updates include proper casing in the virtual keyboard to denote lowercase or capital letters, a toolbar for Bluetooth keyboards that adds word prediction and quick cut / copy / paste tools, and a cascading cards system for recent apps. The new cascading cards system replaces the app thumbnails that scrolled left-to-right with a stacked layout that's oriented right-to-left. It works nicely on the iPad, which has a lot of screen space to work with, but on the smaller display of the iPhone, we prefer iOS 8’s more static system that also offers quick access to recently used contacts. Apple could add back the quick-access contacts in later revisions of iOS 9, but for now, they aren’t there. Mostly, the new system adds visual flair without much added functionality. The last big change is to the search screen, which you can access with a swipe left from your first home screen or swiping down from any screen. When you swipe left into it, Apple gives you a bunch of app suggestions, local points of interest, and favorite contacts. It’s also the starting point for Apple’s new intelligence features, which we’ll get into more below. On your iPhone, the biggest changes in iOS 9 revolve around Siri. The interface has been tweaked slightly to match Siri on Apple Watch, as mentioned above. Apple’s personal assistant will now analyze what’s on your iOS device (calendars, contacts, email) and your habits (i.e. apps you open at certain times of day) and make suggestions whenever you swipe to the left of your home screen. Siri will offer up the contacts and apps she thinks you’re looking for, along with quick links for nearby restaurants, movie theaters, shopping centers, and gas stations. Beneath those two sections, the search screen also provides the latest news based on your location and what’s trending in the headlines. Search is getting smarter in general. Start typing, and it’ll quickly pull up sports scores, the weather, or iCloud documents. We haven’t used iOS 9 nearly long enough to judge how a more ""proactive"" Siri compares to Google’s extremely smart Google Now, however. For privacy reasons, Apple’s solution focuses only what’s on your device, whereas Google pulls from its hugely popular web services to surface relevant data. It’s been a long time coming, but Apple is finally supporting mass transit directions with iOS 9. The feature be launching in select cities to start (Baltimore, Berlin, Chicago, London, Mexico City, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Toronto, Washington, DC, and a number of cities in China round out the list), but Apple can at least say it’s done a thorough job where available. Transit gets its own layer in Apple Maps, and you’ll see the whole underground layout for nearby stations with entrances helpfully marked on the map. Transit directions pull in schedules for bus, ferry, subway, and train — and will also alert you of interruptions and delays. Within the search page, Maps also gets a new ""Nearby"" section that can instantly show restaurants, cafes, shops, and other places in close proximity to your current location. Apple faces a monumental task in trying to compete with Google Maps, but seeing as most iPhone owners use the built-in apps, the addition of Transit is sure to be appreciated. Apple’s basic Notes app has felt a bit like a forgotten stepchild in iOS, but in iOS 9 it's getting some significant upgrades. Notes now supports the ability to insert maps, photos, checklists, and more into each individual note. You can also draw pictures with the tip of your finger and browse all of the attachments to your notes in a single view. If that sounds a lot like Evernote, that’s because it is. If you’re already committed to a different notes service, such as Evernote, iOS 9’s new Notes app likely won’t make you switch. But if you’re using Notes now or you still haven’t figured out a way to give up those Post-Its, the new Notes is a much more serviceable option than before. iOS 9 on the iPad introduces some new ways to multitask on the device. A new Slide Over feature lets you swipe in from the right of the display to look at another app without closing the app you’re currently in. The iPad Air 2 also has the benefit of a full, split-screen mode that lets you run two different apps at the same time. The split-screen mode is essentially an extension of the slide over, which only covers a portion of the display and renders the app below inactive. It’s very similar to the split-screen modes that have long been available in Windows and Samsung’s Android devices, but it’s a completely new idea for the iPad. Split-screen multitasking lets you compose an email while looking at a website, browse a map while reading a note, or send messages while paging through a news article. It has the potential to make the iPad a much more productive device for getting work done. Unfortunately, in this early version of iOS 9, only Apple’s native apps support split-screen functions. You can compose in Messages while looking at The Verge in Safari, but you can’t look at your Twitter timeline while reading your email. We’re pretty excited about this feature and are eager for the final release of iOS 9, when third-party app developers are able to take advantage of it. The other new multitasking feature in iOS 9 on the iPad is picture-in-picture video, which, as you might expect, lets you watch a video in a smaller window while working in another app. Again, it’s a feature that other platforms have had for a while, but before now, if you wanted to do something else while a video was playing in iOS, you had to exit the video entirely. It currently works with Apple’s native video player and any apps that make use of that, but unfortunately YouTube and Netflix are not compatible with it. Apple has said it takes a minimum amount of effort for developers to enable it, so hopefully they will be by the time iOS 9 ships. Of all of the new features in iOS 9, the News app is one of the few entirely new apps debuting with it. It's essentially Apple's answer to Flipboard, Feedly, and the countless other RSS-based news reading apps. It aggregates articles from many sources on a variety of topics you pick, and presents them in an easy-to-read format on the iPhone or iPad. But it also allows publishers to format articles specifically for Apple’s platform, with typography and pictures that match the iPad and iPhone layouts. There aren’t many publications taking advantage of this just yet, but Apple has a dedicated section in the app showcasing them. Other articles in News can either be complete or just stubs that link out to the version on the web, but either way, they are quick to load and easy to browse. News is without a doubt a nice app, but at this stage, it's hard to see how it's any different than the many other news reading apps already available. These are just a few of the highlight features of iOS 9, and there are certainly many more that we haven't covered in detail here. Little things, like better organization of the Notification Center, better support for Apple's new Music service, faster performance, the new Wallet app that replaces Passbook, better battery life, better security, and an improved way to handle system updates are all pretty small in their own merits, but add up to a better overall experience. Apple will be iterating on iOS 9 based on user feedback during this public beta trial, and there are some things that could certainly change before it launches widely this fall. Until then, it might be best just to sit back and wait, unless you have a secondary iOS device kicking around, of course.",0.6480163637496735,0.35198363625032647,0.17797238878011232,1704,4.772300469483568,766,6.1605744125326369,0,52,"Apple, Tech, Hands-on",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

All I had to do was open an app on my phone, pick a username, and type my first message. Predictably, the first thing I wrote my new therapist was a question: ""Hi. How does this work? Do I just tell you about myself?"" The app is an iOS-only release called Talkspace. Launched in March, it aims to connect users to their very own licensed therapist, and then have the two communicate via instant message. ""We aren't going to ask you a ton of questions,"" says Talkspace co-founder Oren Frank, an assertive, good-natured Israeli who used to be the global chief creative officer at marketing agency MRM Worldwide. ""We want to get you to talk to the therapist as quickly as possible."" That's why the company doesn't ask potential users to fill out lengthy questionnaires about their mental health history before giving them access to a private therapy room — a Whatsapp-like encrypted platform that only a user and their therapist can enter. ""It's crazy that some people don't have access to therapy today."" ""It's crazy that some people don't have access to therapy today,"" says Frank, who founded the company with his wife, Roni Frank, in 2012. ""Our vision together was to turn a product that caters to the 1 percent into something that is available to everyone."" That vision started as web-based platform called Talktala, but the company has since changed its name to Talkspace and gone mobile. Their app offers unlimited text-therapy to adults, with various price tiers: subscribers pay $49 for a week, $99 for a month, or just over $620 for a year of unlimited, around-the-clock therapy.   ""Some users suffer from self-harm — cutting — so they can write to our therapist and say, ‘I have an urge to cut myself now, what should I do?'"", says Roni Frank, a former computer scientist turned therapist. ""There's nothing else out there like that."" She thinks the immediacy that's built into the app is beneficial for people in crisis. But as online therapy startups like Talkspace grow in popularity and credibility — other companies include eTherapi and eTherapy Nexus, and Talkspace recently raised $2.5 million in funding — some mental health professionals are voicing concerns about the lack of research supporting e-therapy's effectiveness, and the legal implications for users who choose to partake. lack of supporting research ""What we know is that truly meaningful therapeutic relationships need to have lots of depth and lots of breadth with regards to sustained engagement over time,"" says Frederic Reamer, a professor of social work at Rhode Island College. According to Reamer, an app like Talkspace could be useful as a gateway to further in-person therapy. But as far as a meaningful therapeutic alliance goes, that's something that ""text messaging in and of itself is unlikely to afford."" Talkspace currently counts a few thousand subscribers, 80 percent of whom reside in the US. Of those users, 70 percent are women between the ages of 30 and 35. Most tend to subscribe for three to five months at a time, Oren Frank says, and many interact with their therapists three to four times a day. But Talkspace shouldn't be a form of therapy on its own, says Madalina Sucala, a clinical psychologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who has researched how clinicians feel about e-therapy. ""It's a platform where therapists can meet and talk with their clients,"" she says. And that kind of platform can make dispensing effective therapy difficult. ""Developing a relationship with your patients in online therapies can be a problem because you can't see emotional cues,"" she says, ""and sometimes you can't convey empathy."" ""you can't see emotional cues."" Reamer agrees, and thinks potential users should consider what it means to interact with a therapist who can't see you. ""If you say something and it just moves me profoundly and I start crying, you don't see the crying, the grimace, the visual cues that are present in a traditional clinical relationship,"" he says, ""so there are limitations — not to mention the possible tech failures, like a dead battery,"" that could arise at an inopportune therapeutic moment. A Talkspace therapist I spoke to — not the one I interacted with online — disagrees. ""It's is a great concept and it's the way of the future,"" says Christy Paul, who also trains many of the company's new recruits (each therapist undergoes a month of training with subsequent follow-ups). In fact, she thinks users experience the additional benefit of using the app like a diary. In addition to very serious crises, ""pretty much every issue we can work through with our users online,"" she says, ""[and] we get a lot of positive [user] feedback."" setting boundaries with clients The app also offers therapists the convenience of online correspondence, Paul says, and the chance to work with diverse populations they might not encounter in their home city. But there can be a downside to making yourself available around-the-clock. ""Part of the training that I do with the clinicians is making sure that they do have boundaries,"" Paul says. ""It's also for the users sake, because being so dependent on somebody isn't healthy."" My own Talkspace therapist set boundaries right away. She explained during the free trial that I could write her whenever I felt the need, and that she would try to answer within 15 minutes, if only to acknowledge my message. She also cautioned that she would mostly be available in the evenings, because she works a full-time job during the day. ""But I do try to check my messages throughout the day for people who might be in crisis,"" she wrote.   (Roni and Oren Frank, Talkspace.com) Oren and Roni Frank told me that every therapist operates differently, and that each approach is largely the product of previous training — some are psychologists and others are social workers — and individual schedules. But the idea behind the app remains the same no matter which therapist you end up with: the therapy room is always open, and you always have a direct, private, and anonymous line to your therapist. anonymity can be a useful therapy tool And that anonymity is an extremely useful therapy tool, Oren Frank says. ""Face-to-face meetings can be difficult, because you feel judged and the stigma is high."" By keeping users anonymous, Talkspace hopes to alleviate the stigma that currently prevents 28 percent of people who need mental health care, but don't receive treatment, from finding a therapist. It might also mean that users open up more quickly. ""Something about writing,"" Oren Frank says, ""allows people to be more forthcoming."" The impact of text therapy has largely been ignored by researchers, and existing studies mostly treated it as a supplement to face-to-face therapy, not a stand-alone intervention. But, according to a small 2013 study, the value of text therapy is similar to face-to-face therapy and can even be ""more positive than previous face-to-face evaluations."" Researchers posited that this was because clients experienced lower ""postsession arousal"" — meaning they were calmer following the online sessions versus those conducted in-person. They did, however, describe that hypothesis as ""very tentative"" and suggested that text-therapy might not be suitable for people who suffer from more serious mental health issues. lawyers could get a hold of entire therapy transcripts But Reamer, who often acts as an expert witness in legal proceedings, takes the discomfort surrounding text therapy one step further. He thinks that people involved in court cases, such as custody battles, should stay away from the app. ""If their partner knows that they have major psychological issues, their lawyer would try to get a hold of their therapeutic records,"" he says, adding that lawyers involved in a medical malpractice suit might also try to get a user's records to prove they were depressed before a medical event occurred. ""If you received three-months of counseling via text messaging, I can guarantee that those records will be asked for."" And those records will be a lot more extensive than the notes a clinician takes in-person. So far, Talkspace hasn't encountered lawyers seeking records, Oren Frank says. But if it did, the company would likely have to comply with the law ""just like any other therapist would."" That, the co-founder says, might mean turning over six month's of a user's therapy transcript. ""Digital environments have their issues,"" Oren Frank says, ""so we tried to find a balance."" That balance consists of allowing users to access their last six months and deleting the rest.   (Talkspace.com) The approach might not be perfect, but Talkspace does offer a number of advantages: It's cheaper than most therapy appointments, and it offers the kind of anonymity many of us crave. The diary-style log also has a certain appeal. But the app's greatest selling point might be its convenience. Finding time for a 60-minute appointment once a week is often a struggle — but with Talkspace, ""users can communicate on the go,"" Roni Frank says. When something goes awry, their therapist can ""help them in that moment to reduce their anxiety and the damage it can cause."" the app's greatest selling point might be its convenience That factor is key in enticing a generation raised on text messages and emails, says Susan Ringwood, chief executive at Beat, a UK organization that supports people affected by eating disorders. ""I think it's really important that we maximize this technology,"" Ringwood says, noting that 95 percent of the people who contact Beat now do so online. ""Some people are worried it's not personal enough, but plenty of young people aren't getting help at all, so at least this is something that will engage them."" My own experience with Talkspace was mixed. I had initially planned to subscribe for a full week, but after four days of light, asynchronous texting with my therapist, I thought of ending my experiment. Other than the fact that my therapist used far less punctuation than I would have liked (ending questions with actual question marks is strongly recommended in my book), she did come off as approachable and empathetic, and answered most of my messages within the hour. Still, I hesitated. Something about the permanence of typing private thoughts in a scrollable chatroom made me uneasy, and communicating intimate details of my life to someone whose facial expressions I couldn't read offered little comfort. Text-therapy might very well be a fix for many, but it clearly wasn't going to work for me. A human with a pen in one hand and and a notepad in the other seemed like a much safer and more effective option — provided that her office is located within 20 minutes of work, her sessions are reasonably priced, and she's available between 6:30PM and 7:30PM every other Tuesday.",0.5193957009479208,0.48060429905207924,0.5073129111079789,1839,5.0168569874932025,856,6.4018691588785046,0,0,"Science, Tech, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And yet, few surgeons would call it perfect. Some people don't react very well to the drugs employed, for instance, and there are accounts of people waking up  during surgery and being unable to alert doctors of their situation. But now, a new study suggests that children who are anesthetized before their first birthday experience problems with short-term memory later in life — and these problems may influence reading comprehension, classroom learning, and a child's ability to recall details about their life. ""anesthesia in kids is not harmless."" ""Up until a few years ago we thought that anesthesia in kids was perfectly safe,"" says Greg Stratmann, an anesthesiology professor at the University of California San Francisco and lead author of the study. But in the last few years, some researchers have found that anesthesia might increase a child's risk of experiencing developmental disorders and ADHD-like symptoms. Clearly, Stratmann says, ""anesthesia in kids is not harmless."" In the study, published today in Neuropsycopharmacology, Stratmann and his team investigated the recollection abilities of 28 kids, age 6 to 11, who had undergone anesthesia before the age of one. Each child was matched with another kid of the same age and gender that had never been anesthetized. To test their recognition abilities, both groups of children were shown 80 drawings with varying border colors and locations on a computer screen. Five minutes later, the kids were asked to point out the drawings they had seen from a set of 160 drawings in which the border colors had been removed and locations had been changed. If they could remember the drawing, they were also asked to recall the color and the original location of the drawing. ""We found that for color details, anesthetized kids scored 20 percent less correct answers than unanesthetized kids,"" Stratmann says, even though the two groups of kids did not differ in intelligence or behavior. And in the spatial-recognition task, anesthetized kids scored 21 percent lower than kids who didn't undergo anesthesia at all. the recollection impairment was stronger in rats The researchers also examined what effect anesthesia has on odor recollection in rats. As with the human study, one group of rats had been anesthetized and the other had not, but to ensure that the experiment also accounted for any variables that a surgery might introduce, half of the anesthetized rats also underwent ""tail clamping"" — a procedure that Stratmann says is ""at least as severe as surgical tissue injury."" Regardless of the tissue injury, however, the overall effect of the anesthesia was similar to the one recorded in human infants: ""anesthetized rats had less recollection than unanesthetized rats,"" Stratmann says. But the effect was far stronger in the rat experiment, as half of all anesthetized rats had zero recollection, whereas only two out of 17 rats in the control group had problems remembering odors. When combined, the rat and the human experiments suggest that ""general anesthesia in infancy impairs recollection later in life,"" the researchers write in the study. And in rats, ""this effect is independent of underlying disease or tissue injury."" unmeasured differences may have also played a role Caleb Ing, an anesthesiologist at Columbia University who was not involved in the study, said in an email to The Verge that the study's findings are valuable. ""This builds on other work showing that children exposed to surgery and anesthesia at an early age may have an increased risk of specific cognitive deficit compared to children who were unexposed."" But even though Stratmann's team tried to account for numerous other variables, such as family income and age, it's possible that unmeasured differences between the groups contributed to the effect, he said. Parents should therefore make sure that they ""speak to their physicians before canceling or postponing surgical procedures."" The researchers now plan to compare the recall abilities of children who have undergone general anesthesia with those who have experienced local anesthesia. This may help rule out the possibility that the kids' surgical procedures are contributing to the deficit. They also hope to determine when children stop being vulnerable to these long-term memory effects. this probably won't change pediatric surgery This study is the first to find that anesthesia can cause recall problems in humans, so researchers will need to replicate it multiple times before they can make any firm conclusions. Performing the study on a larger group of children, for example, would go a long way toward validating the results. But the truth is that unless researchers figure out exactly what mechanisms are triggering these memory impairments, the findings are unlikely to change the way doctors approach pediatrics surgery. ""If a child needs a surgical procedure, that child will also need an anesthetic — there is nothing you can do about that,"" Stratmann says. But children are sometimes given anesthetics to prevent them from moving during nonsurgical procedures, such as MRI scans. When those situations arise, he says, ""doctors need to consider [these effects] when thinking about the risk-benefit ratio of procedures requiring general anesthesia."" As for parents who might be worried about possible memory effects, Stratmann says that they may be reversible. ""I derive this hope from a study in animals that we did a few years back."" In the study, Stratmann's team found that increasing a rat's level of exercise and social interaction, as well as increasing the complexity of the environment in which it dwells, reverses the cognitive effects of anesthetics. So ""it's conceivable that such lifestyle changes could do the same in humans,"" he says, ""and help compensate for anesthesia­-induced cognitive problems.""",0.4893098660296959,0.510690133970304,0.5446706363121444,972,5.3209876543209873,474,6.4915611814345988,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The doctors, Dr. Sheryl Van Der Poel from the World Health Organization and Dr. Willem Ombelet, from the Belgian nonprofit The Walking Egg, wanted to set up expensive Western-style IVF labs using hand-me-down equipment. Van Blerkom was less than enthusiastic. ""I said this is doomed to failure,"" he recalls. A power surge — not uncommon in a country with limited infrastructure — could fry finicky but essential equipment in an instant. There would be no easy way to supply the purified medical-grade gasses required to incubate embryos, among many other problems. But Van Blerkom was intrigued. ""I said there’s gotta be a simpler way."" Six years later Van Blerkom’s simpler way exists, and there are 16 Belgian babies to prove it. In a miniature IVF lab about the size of a shoebox, Van Blerkom’s system creates the same conditions necessary for fertilization as a multimillion-dollar lab, at a fraction of the cost. Traditional IVF is expensive. A cycle averages $12,400 according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. This is because IVF in the US uses sophisticated, well-staffed labs, where eggs are fertilized in high-tech incubators flooded with expensive gases. Van Blerkom created a way to get the right mixture of gasses for fertilization in a tiny tube by mixing sodium bicarbonate and citric acid; a mixture not so different from Alka-Seltzer. The tube where the atmosphere is created is then linked by a tiny hose to another tube, which contains the medium where the egg and the sperm eventually mingle. Taking out the need for gasses and incubators, Van Blerkom’s procedure makes IVF much more affordable. When combined with cheaper and milder hormones, Van Blerkom’s procedure could lead to cheap IVF for patients not just in the developing world, but in places like the United States as well. ""I said there’s gotta be a simpler way."" Inspiration for the new method struck months after the 2008 meeting, at one in the morning on a Colorado highway, en route to a house Van Blerkom has high up in the Rockies. Van Blerkom was thinking about a toy from his childhood purchased with boxtops from Kellogg’s Cornflakes, a tiny plastic diver with two chambers. One chamber was filled with vinegar and the other with baking soda. Together the chambers would make CO2, causing the diver to dip and resurface, releasing bubbles along the way. CO2 is also an essential gas for IVF. The diver reminded Van Blerkom of his time as a grad student in the ’70s, driving rabbit and pig embryos between labs in Arizona and Colorado for experiments. To keep the embryos alive, he’d put them in a mix of sodium bicarbonate, water, and citric acid. If the pH got too high to keep the embryos safe, he’d inject some CO2. It was simple. It was cheap. Van Blerkom realized this old ad-hoc system to keep animal embryos alive in transport could be the basis for a whole new kind of IVF lab. ""The chemistry is trivial, it’s how you make bread,"" says Van Blerkom. For two years he worked out his system on mice embryos. In a vacutainer, a vial normally used to collect blood, he mixed sodium bicarbonate and citric acid, then with a rubber hose, linked that tube to another that has the medium where the fertilization will take place. The tubes can maintain the right atmospheric mood for about a week. During that time an egg is put into the tube with the medium along with 4,000 or 5,000 sperm. ""The next day without opening that tube you can see if there is fertilization and then you can follow the embryo development,"" says Ombelet. The procedure is made cheaper with the use of milder hormone stimulants for women than are typically used today, and works in 70 percent of infertility cases according to Ombelet. The other 30 percent of cases, which are mainly due to low sperm counts and require injecting sperm directly, through a procedure called intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI (although Van Blerkom is optimistic the procedure will work with men who have sperm counts lower than the normal threshold). Six years later, the simpler way exists, and there are 16 Belgian babies to prove it. The method proved itself for humans last year in Belgium. With the support of the Walking Egg, more pilot projects are on the way in the UK, South Africa, and elsewhere. If the procedure continues to work, it could provide hope to millions of infertile couples worldwide. But success won’t come without challenge. In the developing world, disseminating simplified IVF requires creating an infrastructure for delivering IVF where none exists, something the Walking Egg is preparing to do. In the developed world, and especially America, it will require undercutting the lucrative IVF industry. The need for greater access to infertility treatment is acute. Up to 15 percent of couples worldwide are affected by infertility, according to the WHO. Of these millions of couples, only a fraction can access care. ""Nowadays we can treat less that 2 percent of the population we need to,"" says Ombelet. ""It’s real human suffering when a couple cannot have children,"" says Dr. Dmitri Dozortsev, president of the American College of Embryology, ""and people who live in countries with no infrastructure, they suffer just as much."" There’s a case that women who can’t conceive in the developing world suffer the most. According to the WHO, ""In many cultures, childless women suffer discrimination, stigma and ostracism."" Wives who can’t bear children might be thrown out, given to another man, or watch as their husband brings in a replacement. The burden of infertility falls ""disproportionately"" on women in the developing world, according to the WHO. While the consequences of infertility might be less dire in America, the state of care is nonetheless depressing. The average cost for a round of IVF is $12,400, and most insurance plans don’t cover it. More rounds of treatment can result in expenses north of $30,000, none of which guarantee success. ""It’s real human suffering when a couple cannot have children."" After two years of testing in mice, Van Blerkom spent a year convincing the Belgian medical ethics authority that it was worth trying in humans. ""It’s so simple that some people don’t believe it,"" he says. So far, it works, ""it’s at least as good as regular IVF,"" says Van Blerkom. In Belgium, the pilot trial indicated that the new system can be as successful as traditional IVF. Van Blerkom says 16 babies have been born from the simplified procedure so far. In the next six months further trials will be underway in the UK, South Africa, Belgium, and Cyprus. Potential future projects in Ghana and elsewhere will be a part of a larger program that will provide training to local medical technicians, and follow up with patients to see how the treatment is affecting their lives. Ironically, simplified IVF might be more of a challenge to implement in the US than subsaharan Africa. ""An embryologist who works in the US,"" says Dozortsev, ""I don’t think [is] going to open a lab based on this device."" While he calls Van Blerkom’s invention ""ingenious"" and ""beautiful,"" he doesn’t see how an American embryologist could open up a profitable lab for just 70 percent of infertility cases. ""He’s right, it would not work at all,"" says Van Blerkom. ""Why would I want to substitute a laboratory that has worked for a long time… for something like this?"" Instead, Van Blerkom pictures simplified IVF operating with a wholly new model. The system could be set up directly within hospitals, instead of dedicated multimillion-dollar IVF labs, with the same training and equipment provided in the Walking Egg’s programs abroad. If it cost around $1,000 to do a round of IVF in the hospital, Van Blerkom imagines insurance companies might actually be willing to start covering it. ""It’s going to be a difficult sell,"" says Van Blerkom, ""but eventually somebody is going to say I want to start up a new IVF program, and I don’t want to invest a million dollars.""",0.526431829115906,0.473568170884094,0.8494163435015598,1411,5.0070871722182853,650,6.3569230769230769,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Goostman says that he likes hamburgers and candy and that his father is a gynecologist, but it's all a lie. This boy is a program created by computer engineers led by Russian Vladimir Veselov and Ukrainian Eugene Demchenko. That a third of judges were convinced that Goostman was a human is significant — at least 30 percent of judges must be swayed for a computer to pass the famous Turing Test. The test, created by legendary computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950, was designed to answer the question ""Can machines think?"" and is a well-known staple of artificial intelligence studies. ""His age also makes it perfectly reasonable that he doesn't know everything."" Goostman allegedly passed the test at the Turing Test 2014 competition in London on Saturday, and the event's organizers at the University of Reading say it's the first computer to succeed. Professor Kevin Warwick, a visiting professor at the university, noted in a release that ""some will claim that the Test has already been passed."" He added that ""the words Turing Test have been applied to similar competitions around the world,"" but ""this event involved the most simultaneous comparison tests than ever before, was independently verified and, crucially, the conversations were unrestricted."" The program nearly passed the test back in 2012, when 29 percent of judges at another competition decided that it was a human. Despite the achievement, the results are far from conclusive and they do not mean that the machines are taking over the world — no matter what you read on the internet. The program is scripted with a personality that likely assisted in convincing judges, and it is not the artificial intelligence you know from sci-fi movies. This is no HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey. For instance, the Turing Test doesn't hinge on whether the computer's responses are correct or not — it only involves the ""humanness"" of its answers. The test is carried out over a text chat. Goostman's ""age"" may have also helped it pass the test. As Veselov notes, ""Our main idea was that he can claim that he knows anything, but his age also makes it perfectly reasonable that he doesn't know everything.""

They’re dying so fast and from so many different causes — habitat loss, climate change, hunting, competition with invasive species — that scientists no longer have a good sense of which need protection. A study recently published in Science estimated the extinction rate to be 1,000 times higher than the natural rate. It also proposed a novel way of figuring out which species are endangered: nature geeks with smartphones. ""We’re all carrying around these sophisticated sensors,"" says Scott Loarie, co-director of iNaturalist, an app singled out in the Science paper. ""It has a camera, GPS, a clock."" You used to have to go out and capture a specimen and bring it to a museum for experts to identify, Loarie says, or tranquilize an animal and collar it with a sensor. ""Now instead of collaring elephants we’re collaring humans. Everyone has a sensor in their pocket. If we can incentivize them to take pictures of elephants, butterflies, plants, it could be a real renaissance."" ""I think a lot of people don’t realize how little we know."" iNaturalist is essentially a photo-sharing app for nature pictures. Users take a photo of a plant or animal and upload it to the site, where other users help identify it. The app automatically tags the observation with GPS coordinates, date, and time, providing a precise and near-real-time map of biodiversity. Photos uploaded to iNaturalist have helped track the American pika, an adorable mountaintop rodent threatened by climate change, and identified at least one new frog species, a red poison-dart frog photographed in the Colombian Andes. It also aided in rediscovering a species of mussel thought to be extirpated from the Northeast United States and helped track invasive geckos in the Southwest. Scientists have used the program to monitor everything from tumors in Hawaiian sea turtles to the syndrome that has been causing starfish to disintegrate along the Pacific coast. More useful than these individual projects, however, are the data generated about what animals live where, data that will become increasingly valuable as more species are threatened by habitat loss and climate change. iNaturalist was devised by Ken-Ichi Ueda, a web developer and self-professed nature dork. Shortly after moving to the Bay Area from Connecticut, Ueda started a blog to post pictures of the plants and animals he saw on hikes. ""I was in awe of all the cool new things out here, and I was challenged as to how to teach myself everything,"" he says. Several years later, with the help of two classmates in his master’s program at the UC Berkeley School of Information, he took the idea and made it social, a place where anyone could post pictures for others to identify. For Ueda, iNaturalist has always been a next-generation field guide. ""If there’s any scientific outcome, any data generation, that has always been a secondary product,"" he says. All this data is making new forms of conservation possible Yet the site began generating lots of data, with over 700,000 photos uploaded so far. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility, an international database of species records, has incorporated about 300,000 of iNaturalist’s research-grade observations. (When a photo reaches two-thirds consensus, it’s classified as ""research grade."") The International Union for Conservation of Nature, which publishes the Red List of Threatened Species, now draws on iNaturalist data to assess the status of flora and fauna around the world. Last month, iNaturalist was acquired by the California Academy of Sciences, which had already been using the platform in its citizen-science programs. Crowdsourcing in science is nothing new. Thomas Jefferson organized a network of observers to monitor the weather, and the Audubon Society has been holding annual bird counts since 1900. Much of the historical information we have about species comes from amateur naturalists who pressed leaves, pinned insects, or stuffed animals and brought them to museums. Apps like iNaturalist, iSpot, and Project Noah have streamlined this process — and in doing so, they’ve unleashed a flood of data that can make new forms of conservation possible. One of the earliest crowdsourced biodiversity programs, eBird, recently provided the foundation for a new type of pinpoint conservation. Launched in 2002 by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the National Audubon Society, eBird began as a way for birdwatchers to submit information about where, when, and what species they saw. But as more data got submitted — it now has 175 million observations — birders started using eBird to find out where they would be most likely to find certain birds. Eventually, researchers at Cornell were able to combine eBird data with satellite imagery of different habitats to make heat-map forecasts of where birds would be.  Northern pintail migration. (Cornell Lab of Ornithology) ""It’s become one of largest databases ever of any biological phenomenon,"" says Mark Reynolds, a scientist with the Nature Conservancy. ""The scientific implications of this data are just beginning to be understood."" This year, Reynolds and his team used the eBird database to create temporary habitat for birds exactly where they needed it. Migratory shorebirds flying between the Arctic and South America must pass through California’s Central Valley, a 450-mile stretch that was once rich in wetlands but now is mostly large-scale farms. However, some of these farms, notably rice, are irrigated by flooding the fields, turning them into ersatz marshes for brief periods. If irrigation could be timed to coincide with migration patterns, the birds would have a place to stop. So The Nature Conservancy overlaid eBird models with satellite maps and then paid rice farmers in barren areas to tweak their irrigation schedules. Eric Hallstein, the economist who designed the reverse auction system that pays farmers to keep their fields flooded, calls the new method alternately ""pop-up habitat"" and ""precision conservation."" So far, it seems to be working. The first test was this spring, as the birds flew north for summer. By late March, Nature Conservancy monitors counted about 120 birds per acre in rice farms participating in the program, and almost none in those that weren’t, according to Reynolds, a sign that the flooded crops were providing much-needed habitat. ""As someone who’s been in conservation for a long time, it’s a real game changer,"" Reynolds says. ""I’ve not seen anything really like this.""  Snow geese in the Central Valley. (Drew Kelly / The Nature Conservancy) Hallstein hopes to expand the program, called BirdReturns, to other crops that use flood irrigation, and possibly start a similar project for migrating salmon. If we know when salmon are migrating, he says, we could pay grape-growers to leave enough water in the streams for fish to get to the ocean and back. This style of conservation wouldn’t work for everything. Permanent reserves will always be better at protecting whole ecosystems. But for certain species that must migrate through increasingly human-dominated landscapes, this dynamic approach is a powerful tool, and it’s made possible by vast amounts of data collected by amateurs. Whether iNaturalist and similar apps can do for other wildlife what eBird did for birds is unclear. After all, birdwatchers were already obsessively recording the birds they saw; Cornell just turned the birder's checklist into an app. ""You’re never going to have an army of beetle watchers in the way we have an army of birdwatchers,"" Loarie acknowledges. ""But with iNaturalist, you don’t have to know what you’re looking at, you just have to want to know what it is."" He hopes to cultivate a ""safari culture,"" where people turn to iNaturalist to identify flora and fauna, and thereby provide data for scientists struggling to understand massive environmental changes. ""We have a real responsibility to do that if we’re going to make policies on climate and agriculture and development,"" he says. ""There’s so much guesswork that goes on. I think a lot of people don’t realize how little we know about what’s happening with species around the world.""",0.587969363755181,0.41203063624481895,0.8460588022066959,1332,5.2702702702702702,720,6.6319444444444446,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And just weeks before the project is set to debut on television to hundreds of millions of fans, it still hasn’t been tested outdoors and awaits some final pieces and construction. It's not even clear which of the eight people from the study will be the one inside the suit.  The point of the project is not to show finished research, however, or sell a particular technology. The Walk Again Project is meant primarily to inspire. It's a demonstration that we’re on the threshold of achieving science fiction: technologies that will allow humans to truly step into the cyborg era. It’s only taken a little over two centuries to get there. Scientists have been studying the way electricity interacts with our biology since 1780, when Luigi Galvani made the legs of a dead frog dance by zapping them with a spark, but the modern history behind the technology that allows our brains to talk directly to machines goes back to the 1950s and John Lilly. He implanted several hundred electrodes into different parts of a  monkey’s brain and used these implants to apply shocks, causing different body parts to move. A decade later in 1963, professor Jose Delgado of Yale tested this theory again like a true Spaniard, stepping into the ring to face a charging bull, which he stopped in its tracks with a zap to the brain. In 1969, professor Eberhard Fetz was able to isolate and record the firing of a single neuron onto a microelectrode he had implanted into the brain of a monkey. Fetz learned that primates could actually tune their brain activity to better interact with the implanted machine. He rewarded them with banana pellets every time they triggered the microelectrode, and the primates quickly improved in their ability to activate this specific section of their brain. This was a critical observation, demonstrating brain’s unique plasticity, its ability to create fresh pathways to fit a new language. Today, BMI research has advanced to not only record the neurons firing in primates’ brains, but to understand what actions the firing of those neurons represent. ""I spend my life chasing the storms that emanate from the hundreds of billions of cells that inhabit our brains,"" explained Miguel Nicolelis, PhD, one of the founders of Center for Neuroengineering at Duke University and the driving force behind the Walk Again Project. ""What we want to do is listen to these brain symphonies and try to extract them from the messages they carry."" Nicolelis and his colleagues at Duke were able to record brain activity and match it to actions. From there they could translate that brain activity into instructions a computer could understand.  Beginning in the year 2000, Nicolelis and his colleagues at Duke made a series of breakthroughs. In the most well known, they implanted a monkey with an array of microelectrodes that could record the firing of clusters of neurons in different parts of the brain. The monkey stood on a treadmill and began to walk. On the other side of the planet, a robot in Japan received the signal emanating from the primate’s brain and began to walk. Primates in the Duke lab learned to control robotic arms using only their thoughts. And like in the early experiments done by Fetz, the primates showed a striking ability to improve the control of these new limbs. ""The brain is a remarkable instrument,"" says professor Craig Henriquez, who helped to found the Duke lab. ""It has the ability to rewire itself, to create new connections. That’s what gives the BMI paradigm its power. You are not limited just by what you can physically engineer, because the brain evolves to better suit the interface."" After his success with primates, Nicolelis was eager to apply the advances in BMI to people. But there were some big challenges in the transition from lab animals to human patients, namely that many people weren’t willing to undergo invasive brain surgery for the purposes of clinical research. ""There is an open question of whether you need to have implants to get really fine grained control,"" says Henriquez. The Walk Again Project hopes to answer that question, at least partially. While it is based on research in animals that required surgery, it will be using only external EEG headsets to gather brain activity. The fact that these patients were paralyzed presented another challenge. Unlike the lab monkeys, who could move their own arms and observe how the robot arm moved in response, these participants can’t move their legs, or for many, really remember the subconscious thought process that takes place when you want to travel by putting one foot in front of the other. The first step was building up the pathways in the brain that would send mental commands to the BMI to restore locomotion. To train the patients in this new way of thinking about movement, researchers turned to virtual reality. Each subject was given an EEG headset and an Oculus Rift. Inside the head-mounted display, the subjects saw a virtual avatar of themselves from the waist down. When they thought about walking, the avatar legs walked, and this helped the brain to build new connections geared towards controlling the exoskeleton. ""We also simulate the stadium, and the roar of the crowd,"" says Regis Kopper, who runs Duke’s VR lab. ""To help them prepare for the stress of the big day."" Once the VR training had established a baseline for sending commands to the legs, there was a second hurdle. Much of walking happens at the level of reflex, and without the peripheral nervous system that helps people balance, coordinate, and adjust to the terrain, walking can be a very challenging task. That’s why even the most advanced robots have trouble navigating stairs or narrow hallways that would seem simple to humans. If the patients were going to successfully walk or kick a ball, it wasn’t enough that they be able to move the exoskeleton’s legs — they had to feel them as well. The breakthrough was a special shirt with vibrating pads on its forearm. As the robot walked, the contact of its heel and toe on the ground made corresponding sensations occur along parts of the right and left arms. ""The brain essentially remapped one part of the body onto another,"" says Henriquez. ""This restored what we call proprioception, the spacial awareness humans need for walking."" In recent weeks all eight of the test subjects have successfully walked using the exoskeleton, with one completing an astonishing 132 steps. The plan is to have the volunteer who works best with the exoskeleton perform the opening kick. But the success of the very public demonstration is still up in the air. The suit hasn’t been completely finished and it has yet to be tested in an outdoor environment. The group won't confirm who exactly will be wearing the suit. Nicolelis, for his part, isn’t worried. Asked when he thought the entire apparatus would be ready, he replied: ""Thirty minutes before."" The Walk Again project may be the most high-profile example of BMI, but there have been a string of breakthrough applications in recent years. A patient at the University of Pittsburgh achieved unprecedented levels of fine motor control with a robotic arm controlled by brain activity. The Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago introduced the world’s first mind controlled prosthetic leg. For now the use of advanced BMI technologies is largely confined to academic and medical research, but some projects, like DARPA’s Deka arm, have received FDA approval and are beginning to move into the real world.  As it improves in capability and comes down in cost, BMI may open the door to a world of human enhancement that would see people merging with machines, not to restore lost capabilities, but to augment their own abilities with cyborg power-ups. ""From the standpoint of defense, we have a lot of good reasons to do it,"" says Alan Rudolph, a former DARPA scientist and Walk Again Project member. Rudolph, for example, worked on the Big Dog, and says BMI may allow human pilots to control mechanical units with their minds, giving them the ability to navigate uncertain or dynamic terrain in a way that has so far been impossible while keeping soldiers out of harms way. Our thoughts might control a robot on the surface of Mars or a microsurgical bot navigating the inside of the human body. There is a subculture of DIY biohackers and grinders who are eager to begin adopting cyborg technology and who are willing, at least in theory, to amputate functional limbs if it’s possible to replace them with stronger, more functional, mechanical ones.  ""I know what the limits of the human body are like,"" says Tim Sarver, a member of the Pittsburgh biohacker collective Grindhouse Wetwares. ""Once you’ve seen the capabilities of a 5000psi hydraulic system, it’s no comparison."" For now, this sci-fi vision all starts with a single kick on the World Cup pitch, but our inevitable cyborg future is indeed coming. A recent demonstration at the University of Washington enabled one person’s thoughts to control the movements of another person’s body — a brain-to-brain interface — and it holds the key to BMI’s most promising potential application. ""In this futuristic scenario, voluntary electrical brain waves, the biological alphabet that underlies human thinking, will maneuver large and small robots, control airships from afar,"" wrote Nicolelis. ""And perhaps even allow for the sharing of thoughts and sensations with one individual to another.""",0.642352867149484,0.35764713285051597,0.838326722111059,1796,5.0044543429844097,842,6.5011876484560567,1,0,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As the other gags were swiftly forgotten, the button — attached to a 60-second timer that would reset every time it was clicked — endured, inspiring devotion and obsession. Now more than two months later, the button is finally gone, leaving a complicated history, a ream of software designed to decode its meaning, and a community fractured into color-coded cults. Reddit staff announced the appearance of the button at 9AM ET on April Fool's Day. Users could head to the dedicated subreddit — r/thebutton — and choose to press it at any point, but were warned that they only had one chance to do so. Soon after, it was realized that people who did push would receive a colored circle next to their username, the hue dependent on when you chose to push it. Push it with 60 seconds on the clock, and the circle would be purple; push it with 45 seconds and you'd get blue, and so on, through 10-second intervals. Choose to leave the button unpressed, however, and your circle would remain gray.  Those bearing circles of the same color quickly banded into factions, giving life to mock religions and complex backstories, and rivalries that oscillated between silly and serious. Of the button-pushers, the purples were the largest group at the experiment's end, people eager to see what the fuss was about and push the button seconds after the timer was reset. But they were dwarfed by no-pressers, people who chose to abstain from pushing, and characterized based on their philosophy toward the concept. The ""Grey Hopeful,"" for example, believed that they should watch the timer tick down to zero in the hope they will receive rewards ""in the after-timer"" for doing so, while ""The Followers of the Shade"" avoided pushing the button in an attempt to ensure their Reddit flair stayed forever gray. The Knights of the Button sacrificed themselves to keep the timer going Other groups mobilized to ensure the button would forever be pressed before the timer ran out. One user built a browser extension that organized volunteer pushers, and when that initiative showed cracks, developed a second extension — called The Necromancer — that would use dormant ""zombie"" accounts to stop the timer from running down. This second scheme was undone temporarily when one of the zombie accounts roped into service proved to be disallowed from pushing the button. Only the Knights of the Button, a group dedicated to sacrificing their own flair to keep the experiment running, kept the experiment alive. But while a cadre of helpful souls built tools to analyze the data and keep the button pressed, others built malicious software masquerading as monitoring apps. Reddit user MrFunderThuck designed a plugin that would press the button automatically when installed, forcing a previously gray-flaired user to join the ranks of the purples or the blues. When his scheme was busted, MrFunderThuck admitted it was ""an effort to convert the non-pressers,"" but apologized to people who appeared genuinely offended by his actions. Fortunately his nefarious aims were confined to the metaverse built up around the button — the recent discovery that popular plugin Hola was selling Chrome users' bandwidth shows that we could stand to be more careful with the extensions we install. In addition to community-led studies, Reddit did its own analysis of button-pressers. At first, 60 percent of visitors to the button clicked it. In four days that was down to 10 percent, before dropping to 5 percent after two weeks, where it stayed for the rest of its life. Most pressers were PC owners — 66 percent of the final total — with less than a third coming from Mac, 11 percent coming from Android, and only 3 percent from iPhone. The last person to push the button did so on June 5th It had to end some day. The collected efforts of the Knights, the zombies, and assorted other factions failed on the 5th of June when user BigGoron pushed the button for the last time. But while the button has gone, its impressive legacy remains: an encyclopedia's worth of lore, stories, and mini-memes, almost all of it produced in a short two months by a community that coalesced from nothing. The button was characterized by a total lack of information provided by its creators, yet it seems that it was precisely Reddit's silence that seemed to produce the vacuum into which thousands fed their creativity. Pushing the button didn't technically do anything beyond perpetuate its existence, but pushing the button also built jokey religions, thousand-strong factions, detailed wikis, cod-philosophies, new relationships, and — in one case — a marriage. Compared to other April Fool's jokes forgotten the next day, Reddit's latest entry appears destined for the annals of internet history, enshrined in place by a community that jumped at the chance to create and populate a new corner of the web.",0.43750482099676413,0.5624951790032359,0.8375478956830874,843,4.9940688018979831,445,6.2247191011235952,0,0,"Culture, Web, Report",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The initiative will help journalists cover breaking news by making sense of the flood of public information on Twitter. Dataminr uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the Twitter firehose of data and highlight the needle in the haystack so CNN reporters can find the most important, relevant, and reliable facts and images from around the world.  Using machine learning algorithms to analyze the Twitter firehose of data Dataminr is a five-year-old startup that has raised $48 million from investors like Box Group, Venrock and IVP. Until now it has worked with clients in financial services, helping banks and hedge funds make real-time investment decisions by processing huge amounts of social media content and extracting the high-value information. For example Dataminr told its financial clients that the AP tweet about an explosion at the White House was false five minutes before the AP itself corrected the facts. Dataminr has now built a new tool tailored for journalists, chopping news up into different feeds and pinging reporters at their desks or via mobile app with alerts about breaking stories. It's hoping to be able to alert news outlets to breaking news before they would get it otherwise, as the service claims it was able to do when detecting the death of Osama Bin Laden before any official outlets reported it.   ""There is actually a very different set of algorithms that help us determine if information spreading on Twitter will move markets, as opposed to becoming a big news story,"" said Dataminr CEO Ted Bailey. ""So it's not a matter of more or less data, but of how the service is focused and tuned."" Sites like CNN have put Twitter front and center in their news gathering going back to 2009, when the Twitpic of passengers on the wing of a crashed plane floating in the Hudson became the iconic image that helped define the story. Today's announcement is a deepening of that practice, bringing a purpose-built product and official partnership. For example, CNN first learned about the shooting this weekend at a mall in Maryland through Dataminr, which has been deployed in-house for several months now, and picked up on a tweet from a first responder on the scene. The alert helped CNN be one of the first on the story. The company says it now produces about two stories a day based off tips from its Dataminr alerts. ""It's like bionic vision for our reporters,"" said Kenneth Estenson, general manager of CNN digital.

The Korean company already enjoys a vast lead over its rivals and is now ideally positioned to continue dominating in both the US and abroad. Shrugging off the size of that challenge, Lenovo has decided to buy Motorola Mobility for $2.91 billion and step up its efforts at becoming a smartphone vendor with a truly global reach. The world’s biggest PC maker today, Lenovo,  was anonymous to many until just recently. But in 2005, the Chinese company that only two years earlier had renamed itself from the generic Legend acquired a brand name and cachet that catapulted it to global renown. Lenovo bought IBM’s personal computer business for $1.75 billion, the star jewel of which was the well respected ThinkPad brand. After engendering only blank stares outside of China, the Lenovo name became recognizable almost overnight. There were questions as to whether IBM’s signature quality and durability would be maintained by the less reputed Chinese company, but in order to ask, you had to know its name first. Now Lenovo wants to recreate that same success in the mobile realm, though it’s by no means a new effort for the company. Lenovo has been a rumored suitor for every major mobile takeover that’s taken place in recent years — from Palm, through Nokia, to a series of dalliances with BlackBerry that were eventually thwarted by the Canadian government stepping in. If you had $3 billion to spend on brand recognition, would you spend it on Motorola? That Lenovo was willing to spend billions to hitch a ride on BlackBerry’s setting star shows just how ravenously hungry for brand recognition the Chinese company is. It has the money and production capacity to be a big mobile player, but it’s desperately lacking a popular name to put atop that workshop. As Google’s Larry Page explained in the wake of the deal announcement, ""Lenovo has the expertise and track record to scale Motorola Mobility into a major player."" In spite of being known for its PC business, Lenovo actually sells more mobile devices than PCs, with the majority of them going to its home market of China. The task of expanding those sales to other countries, however — particularly the critical developed markets of the US and Western Europe — is not an easy one. Samsung and Apple have secured an enormous lead, which is only being consolidated through extensive retail and marketing networks, meaning that if Lenovo is to find any room it’ll have to be willing to both spend big and make tough decisions. That may not be great news for anyone eager to see Motorola continue to operate along its current trajectory. The once-troubled mobile maker has revitalized its brand image under Google’s leadership — endearing itself to the American consumer with its Texas assembly plant and aggressive Moto X and G pricing — but it’s also been hemorrhaging money and failing to meet sales expectations. Lenovo now has to choose whether to take a scythe to Motorola’s remaining operations or to keep people employed and extend the ""made in America"" message and goodwill. Upheaval at Motorola is inevitable, the question is how much it will hurt The Chinese company builds some of its ThinkPads in North Carolina, so there’s a clear appreciation of the reputational benefits of employing some of the same consumers you’re trying to sell to, but that doesn’t change the fact that Lenovo already has a thriving mobile business that conflicts with Motorola’s loss-making production. Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing, the same savvy leader responsible for the company's renaming in 2003, says no firm plans have yet been made: ""We will evaluate what is best for the company [with regard to US manufacturing]. Right now, most of the manufacturing is outsourced. We will be looking at that.""  While it is no longer the biggest by volume, the US smartphone market remains the most important. Nokia and Sony have demonstrated how tough it is to be a global phone-maker without a significant presence in American stores. Lenovo is lowering that hurdle with its purchase of Motorola, which is both a homegrown brand and the manufacturer of Verizon’s darling Droid line. In announcing the deal, Lenovo points out that it represents a gain of 50 new carrier relationships for the company, with the good graces of the big US operators like Verizon being the most crucial. It’s also worth noting how often Yuanqing repeated the word ""global"" in his comments on the Moto acquisition — Lenovo’s goal is to recreate its mobile success in China on an even vaster scale. Though still cagey on the details of its plans, Lenovo has revealed that it intends to use Motorola’s name in the Americas and maintain its own branding in China. More important to phone buyers, however, will be how this takeover will affect the substance rather than the marketing of future devices. The Google-owned Motorola started delivering Android updates even faster than scheduled, the Moto X is considered one of the best handsets on the market, and the elegantly improved software on Moto’s 2013 phones has been lauded for its cleanliness and efficacy. Would a Lenovo takeover signal a return to torturous update waiting times, broken promises, and bloated software? Will Android updates be as swift without Google steering the ship? One reason to keep faith with the Chinese company is its track record. In September, 2012 Lenovo promised to turn its loss-making mobile division to profit within six months and in early 2013 it duly delivered. Then, in the middle of last year, Yuanqing said Lenovo intends to sell phones in the US within a year and he’s now completed a $2.9 billion down payment toward realizing that goal. Still, the temptation to propagate Lenovo’s own UI and software ecosystem — an urge that wasn’t present when Google owned Motorola — could still come to scupper the promising future that the Moto X and G had been harbinging. When Lenovo took over the ThinkPad line, it didn’t just buy the name. Management of the resulting company was actually handed off to a team of experienced IBM execs, while research and design were also kept up to their earlier standards thanks to the retention of people like Arimasa Naitoh, who’s habitually referred to as the father of the ThinkPad. The same is not true with the Motorola takeover, which excludes the Advanced Technology and Projects team led by former DARPA chief Regina Dugan. Without Moto’s quixotic research arm — responsible for modular phone and electronic tattoo concepts — Lenovo’s not buying much in the way of innovation or forward-thinking design. It all ultimately comes down to having a name that Americans can trust and invest their dollars in. Lenovo has already proven that it can rejuvenate a well-regarded brand with its ThinkPad acquisition, but it has a much bigger challenge on its hands with Motorola. Sales are poor, operations aren’t profitable, and employee morale must be at an all-time low after two buyouts in less than three years. All Motorola has to offer now is its name and history.

For its current quarter, Amazon says it expects to bring in net sales between $18.2 and $19.9 billion. That's near the higher end of the $19.67 billion Wall Street expected, but comes with what Amazon warns could be a range between a $200 million gain or loss in either direction. Despite the positive sales growth, investors were disappointed by the results. Shares of Amazon's stock were trading down as much as $40.51 after-hours, sliding more than 10 percent.

While sales have grown, so too have the company's expenses as it spends on new ventures including shipping infrastructure and content deals that could set it apart from rivals. Much of the company's boasting has instead turned to sales, which have come in higher than what Wall Street's expected. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gave a small preview on this just-reported quarter last month, boasting that it was the ""best ever"" holiday sales period the company's ever had, including an all-time record for Cyber Monday sales. Bezos also said that the company had to limit the number of people signing up for its Prime subscription service to keep it from affecting the quality of service for its existing members. In the company's press release announcing the earnings, Bezos said the company was ""just scratching the surface of what world-class customer service can be."" Media deals and other investments During the quarter Amazon launched, expanded, and invested in numerous products and projects. On the product side that list included software updates to the second-generation model of its Kindle Paperwhite and new HDX models of its Kindle Fire tablet line, along with Kindle Matchbook, a service that gives physical book buyers digital copies on some titles. Investments include hiring 70,000 seasonal employees to ship out holiday orders, acquiring educational company TenMarks, announcing plans to open up six new fulfillment centers, and inking content deals with PBS and A24 films. For the entire fiscal year, Amazon's sales were up 22 percent from 2012, a figure the company says was slightly higher at 24 percent when excluding changes to foreign exchange rates. Amazon's operating income also increased by 10 percent to $745 million. Update: Amazon announced plans to possibly increase the price of its Amazon Prime subscription service by $20 to $40 a year in the US, citing the increased price of shipping.

Lenovo will buy Motorola for $2.91 billion in a mixture of cash and stock. Google will retain ownership of the vast majority of Motorola's patents, while 2,000 patents and a license on the remaining patents will go to Lenovo. At the deal's closing, Lenovo will pay Google $660 million in cash and $750 million in stock, while the remaining $1.5 billion will be paid out over three years. Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing said that although his company doesn't have ""an effective plan yet,"" it has confidence that it can turn the currently unprofitable Motorola's fortunes around. Yang also stated that, within a year of the Motorola acquisition, Lenovo expected to sell 100 million smartphones worldwide. In 2013, Lenovo shipped an estimated 45 million smartphones, a 90 percent growth from the previous year.  Google believes Lenovo can turn Motorola into ""a major player within the Android ecosystem."" ""Lenovo has the expertise and track record to scale Motorola Mobility into a major player within the Android ecosystem,"" Google CEO Larry Page said in a statement. ""This move will enable Google to devote our energy to driving innovation across the Android ecosystem, for the benefit of smartphone users everywhere."" Google initially bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion back in 2012, but it said at the time that it was mainly interested in the company's patent portfolio. Now, Google is offloading its subsidiary's handset business, which has been losing hundreds of millions each quarter since the purchase. Google will hold on to Motorola's ambitious Advanced Technology and Projects group, however, and it previously sold off Motorola's set-top box unit for over $2 billion. Though patents are a large part of what drew Google's interest to Motorola in the first place, those patents haven't been as helpful as Google initially hoped. Google seems to have highly overvalued Motorola's portfolio, which hasn't been able to bring in nearly as much in royalties as either company seemingly expected. It also hasn't been able to use those patents very aggressively, seeing them fail when used in an attempt to block sales of the iPhone. The entire ownership of Motorola has been something of a headache for Google, and it appears that it's finally time for Google to cut its losses. That's good news for Lenovo, which has been vocal about its intention to move into the US smartphone market this year. Lenovo hasn't made much headway with that until now. It made a bid for BlackBerry late in 2013, but its offer was ultimately blocked. Now, it'll see a much stronger start with the purchase of Motorola. Motorola actually marks Lenovo's second acquisition announcement this month: just last week it said that it had reached a deal to buy IBM's x86 server business. We’ve just signed an agreement to sell Motorola to Lenovo for $2.91 billion: http://t.co/PKDXrTq6Oe pic.twitter.com/vLcDBXlvIh  The purchase of Motorola plays to Lenovo's experience in taking an established brand and building upon it. It purchased its ThinkPad business from IBM in 2005, and has gone on to create a continually successful line of laptops from it. Lenovo is certainly hoping to do the same with Motorola, which has consistently built strong devices but has often struggled against competitors with more marketing muscle. ""The acquisition of such an iconic brand, innovative product portfolio and incredibly talented global team will immediately make Lenovo a strong global competitor in smartphones,"" Yang said in a statement. ""We will immediately have the opportunity to become a strong global player in the fast-growing mobile space."" ""We will become a much stronger number three smartphone company."" Both Lenovo and Google have high expectations for Motorola coming out of the acquisition. Motorola said the acquisition will help it to achieve the rapid growth it's looking for. ""With the recent launches of Moto X and Moto G, we have tremendous momentum right now and Lenovo’s hardware expertise and global reach will only help to accelerate this,"" Motorola CEO Dennis Woodside said in a statement. In an alleged email to employees, which has been leaked to TechCrunch, Page said that he believes Motorola will do better under a company that can fully commit to a focus on smartphones. ""The smartphone market is super competitive, and to thrive it helps to be all in when it comes to making mobile devices,"" Page wrote. ""It’s why we believe that Motorola will be better served by Lenovo."" On a conference call discussing the acquisition, Yang said that Woodside and Motorola's existing management team would be staying on board. Yang also said that he felt the two brands were complimentary, and that both the Motorola and Lenovo brand would remain in use where they were already strong. ""A detailed plan will be made after we close the deal,"" Yang said. ""Why am I so confident? I have several reasons."" Despite Motorola's ongoing struggle to reach profitability, Yang is extremely optimistic about what it will do under Lenovo. ""Why am I so confident? I have several reasons."" Yang cites five: it will immediately make Lenovo a major smartphone company in the US and give it relationships with over 50 wireless carriers worldwide, Motorola is an established and respected brand, the deal includes important patents and licenses, it will help address new markets with a diverse smartphone lineup, and it brings along Motorola's expertise in mature smartphone markets. Despite his intention to continue using the Lenovo name where it's strong, Yang emphasized that the Motorola name would play a major role in its ability to compete in the United States and other major markets. ""We had a similar opportunity with the Think brand, and we succeeded,"" Yang said. He believes the acquisition will ultimately make Motorola a far stronger smartphone manufacturer, turning it into a capable competitor against the industry's giants. ""We will become a much stronger number three smartphone company,"" Yang said, referencing Motorola's position as the third-place Android smartphone manufacturer in the US. ""Motorola brings a strong brand, brilliant engineering, great products, [and] outstanding relationships with retailers.""

In the middle of the 20th century, everything from televisions to microwaves to radios came as a bundle of technology housed inside a wooden case or cabinet. These gadgets were imposters, disguised as furniture so as to slip into our homes unnoticed next to the armoire and the wood-paneled wall. So they were made to feel natural, to feel like part of our homes.   Soon, though, gadgets became the focal point of our living rooms. And as devices from televisions and cars to smartphones and tablets were accepted and commoditized, as manufacturing speed and cost outweighed all other factors, as plastics and metals became both easier and cheaper to work with, wooden electronics became a cottage industry consisting mostly of handmade smartphone cases and high-end audio gear.   But wood’s relegation to the sidelines of the electronics industry isn’t because it’s unappealing, says Rick Osterloh, the SVP of product at Motorola. And just about a year ago, he and his team set about to bring it back. After many false starts (”There were many moments like that,” he says with a sigh when I ask if the team ever thought about giving up) and a lot of high-volume carpentry, Motorola finally launched its Natural Collection: Moto X backs in bamboo and three different wood finishes. I’ve been using a bamboo model for about two weeks, and I think the future might look a lot more like our wood-paneled past than we thought.  “It’s a different way of thinking about products,” Ken Tomita tells me. He’s the co-founder of Grove, one of the very first iPhone case-makers, and a self-proclaimed “guy who knows way too much about wood.” Our gadgets are precious objects, he says, and we obsess about protecting them. “But materials like wood, and leather, that’s what they’re there for: to get beat up a little bit.” He sees it as a perfect, and welcome, contrast. “These tech products … are made out of aluminum, stainless steel, glass — it’s all these cold surfaces. We throw in the warmth, the natural material.” At Motorola, using wood came up early in the Moto X’s development. From the beginning, the X Phone (as Osterloh refers to it) was intended to come with a big and growing number of customization options, and wood seemed like a good one to add to the list. Motorola originally saw it as a niche option offered to the same people who pay more for their iPhone case than for the phone itself. But when the X Phone team started to show the wooden models to small focus groups, the response was overwhelming. “People were immediately like, ‘Whoa, that’s totally different from anything I’ve seen before,’” says Osterloh. “And that was our internal reaction, too — people just couldn’t believe that it was actually real.” Just like that, the Natural Collection became a much bigger project for Motorola. It presented a problem: there’s no process for the mass production of wood components. “There’s no supply chain for wood,” Osterloh says, “so the people we normally go and do business with, they hadn’t done stuff like this. Wood’s typically used for furniture and stuff like that, and it’s just a totally different group of people from the folks that we normally do business with.”  A group within the product team was tasked with turning wood-backed phones into a reality. That meant first finding the right materials: wood that could be shaped into the X’s rounded back, that wouldn’t crack or splinter or warp, and that wouldn’t interfere with the phone’s radios or operation. “It took us several quarters,” Osterloh says, “just to figure out which types of wood we could use, what kinds of finishes we could do, and how in the end it would look.” Finding wood that won't warp, or splinter, or crack, is hard Motorola is sourcing wood and bamboo from all over the world, from a mostly new set of partners — Osterloh declined to be more specific — and it had to rethink some of its manufacturing as well. Wood is the enemy of mass production: no two pieces are alike. And Motorola’s process isn’t exactly basic, either, Osterloh says. “Making the holes for the camera and the flash, that requires a step to laser cut and actually create these holes without burning or scarring the material. And then you’ve got another step to put our logo on there, and any regulatory requirements on there, all that printing work.” All that comes after the wood is cut into thin slices and rounded into the phone’s shape. Motorola put a tremendous amount of work into creating a sustainable process and supply chain for materials like wood, but Osterloh admits it’s still not exactly mass production. That’s why the Natural Collection comes with an additional $25 cost: Motorola simply couldn’t keep up if everyone bought it. “There is a point where… we don’t have a lot of flexibility in making these. It would take us a long time to get the supply chain warmed up to making an enormous quantity.” The process, he tells me, takes weeks from beginning to end. If wood does make a comeback, that’s the danger: that in an effort to capitalize on the popularity of the material, some manufacturers cut the same corners they did decades ago. Grove’s Ken Tomita says he’s already seeing this happen: “Sometimes it’s not even real wood. It’s just a picture of wood. Because it’s becoming trendy, there’s some poor-quality stuff out there.” And unlike with plastic or aluminum, unskilled craftsmanship and poor materials don’t just make the device look or feel bad; “the big weakness is durability,” he says, and it doesn’t take much to cause huge problems. Motorola’s Osterloh told me over and over that he’s committed to using only the best materials and production techniques, but as demand grows it’s not hard to see the temptations he’ll face. And even now, the ebony, teak, and walnut models are made of a different wood and then treated to look like their namesake.  But when it’s done right, there’s something uniquely comfortable about the result, a device that feels somehow more personal than most smartphones. My bamboo Moto X already has a scuff or two, and a dark spot from when I spilled coffee on it, but it doesn’t feel scuffed or dirty. It just feels weathered. Like a good pair of jeans, the more I use my phone the more it feels mine. That said, it’s clear Motorola’s still learning how to do this. It’s only the back of my X Phone that’s made of wood: it still looks and feels mostly like any other. And I’m more than a little worried about the occasional flaking of the bamboo I’ve noticed, or the seam around its edges that may grow over time. There’s the slightest green discoloration that appeared almost immediately around the edges, too, which I don’t particularly care for. But the material suits the phone: just as our TVs were once made to fade into our living rooms, our phones aren’t things to be noticed or looked at anymore, and they’re not meant to scream “technology!” They’re just part of our lives, our surroundings. This X Phone seems to come right out of Her, with its wood-encased computers and phones that look more like mid-century cigarette cases than gadgets. As technology becomes more intimately personal, it too ought to become more familiar, more natural. And it’s an important counterpoint to the otherwise stark, cold machinery that surrounds us. “If you have this modern condo,” Grove’s Tomita tells me, “and it’s all glass and concrete, you want to put some plants in it, so you don’t feel like you’re living in a hospital. There are studies that show people heal faster when they’re surrounded by plants. It’s the same thing — it makes us feel good to be around natural things.”",0.39865346530484325,0.6013465346951568,0.18410301167243737,1351,4.9089563286454476,652,6.1993865030674851,0,0,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

With the $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola it wasn’t just taking on an ailing manufacturer — challenge enough — but simultaneously competing with Google’s own hardware partners in the Android ecosystem, meaning it had to tread carefully. The payoff for all that heartache? Motorola’s impressive collection of 24,000 patents and patent applications. Unfortunately for Google, the much-ballyhooed war chest of intellectual property didn’t hold up in the courtroom. Google’s initial motivation for buying Motorola was extremely simple: Motorola’s patent portfolio included core pieces of standard technologies like Wi-Fi and GSM. At the height of the patent battles between Apple and Android phone manufacturers like Samsung, governments around the world were undecided on whether those ""standards-essential"" patents could be used to completely block products from the market — and Motorola had already filed several lawsuits attempting to block the iPhone from sale in courts across the US. If Google had succeeded in blocking the iPhone it would have been the smartest $12.5 billion ever spent If Google had succeeded in using Motorola’s patents to block the iPhone, gain Congressional interest, and force Apple to the negotiating table, it would have been the smartest $12.5 billion ever spent. Unfortunately, it didn’t quite work that way. Court after court rejected Motorola’s patent claims — the influential Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit completely threw out the case after deciding neither Apple nor Motorola had even demonstrated any reason to be in court — and trade agencies in the US and Europe took a hard line against using standards patents to block products. In the US, Google settled a Federal Trade Commission investigation into its improper use of standards patents by agreeing that those patents would not be used to block products from market but instead be licensed fairly. And the value of a fair license plummeted: the court in Motorola’s case against Microsoft’s Xbox 360 found that Microsoft owed just $1.7M in royalties per year, far less than the $4 billion Motorola had demanded. Motorola’s patent portfolio was essentially rendered worthless; an anemic licensing business compared to Google’s other massive revenue streams. While the patent play blew up, the hardware side may have paid off But while the patent play blew up spectacularly, the hardware side of the Motorola acquisition may have actually paid off: by building its own phones, Google gained valuable leverage over the Android partners, particularly Samsung. Motorola actually made some nice phones during its run at Google. The flagship Moto X was well-received by critics, including our own. ""The additions to the software that Motorola has made are legitimately useful and really quite impressive,"" wrote Joshua Topolsky. ""They add to the experience of Android without removing what is most vital in Google's software, unlike the competition, which seems intent on obscuring what's already a sophisticated and beautiful operating system."" The Moto X never sold well, but it increased the pressure on Google's partners to build great products by showing what was possible. The problem was that Google’s Motorola lacked the marketing and distribution power needed to actually sell enough phones. Despite a warm welcome from critics, Motorola’s losses widened to $248 million during the first quarter when the Moto X was on sale. ""Motorola needs to build tighter relationships with other carriers after a long tie-up with Verizon on the Droid line,"" said Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research. Overall, Motorola had burned through $600 million since the acquisition and was on pace to bleed about $1 billion a year. To turn things around Google would have had to pour hundreds of millions into expanding marketing and distribution, upping the competition with its partners. Rather than doubling down on making its own phones, Google used Motorola as leverage to secure the Android ecosystem against a painful and expensive patent battle and to prod its partners into accepting its version of Android. A few days after bringing Samsung in more tightly, Google let go of Motorola Earlier this week it reached an interesting détente with Samsung: the two companies agreed to share patents, helping each other defensively and not litigating against one another. At the same time, Samsung reportedly made concessions about what Android will look like on its future devices, agreeing to tone down the extensive customization and duplication of apps and services that characterize its most popular phones and tablets. It’s hardly a coincidence that a few days after bringing Samsung more tightly into the fold, Google let go of Motorola. How long will this balance hold? The purchase of Nest indicates that Google has rethought its hardware strategy, preferring to avoid competition with its Android partners and instead invest in the wide-open world of connected devices and smart homes instead. Larry Page said as much in an email to staffers about the Motorola sale. ""As a side note, this does not signal a larger shift for our other hardware efforts.  The dynamics and maturity of the wearable and home markets, for example, are very different from that of the mobile industry.  We’re excited by the opportunities to build amazing new products for users within these emerging ecosystems."" Of course, Samsung has plenty of interest in building a smart home of its own. The delicate dance goes on.",0.5977212739486293,0.4022787260513707,0.14421118404832559,896,5.3549107142857144,484,6.4028925619834709,0,0,"Business, Google, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

At an investor briefing today, CEO and president Satoru Iwata said that Nintendo will use smart devices to “make connections with customers,” though he ruled out releasing existing games on those platforms, believing the company unable to ""show its strength as an integrated hardware-software business"" elsewhere. Nintendo is not expressly restricting its app developers from creating games Without going into much detail, Iwata said that ""service"" apps will be released this year, noting that the company would seek to use smart devices for services such as selling games that had previously been confined to games consoles. Iwata recognizes that such devices are likely to provide a better experience than Nintendo's own hardware for certain features unrelated to games, so the company will focus on using them for those purposes. Nintendo is not expressly restricting its app developers from creating games or using the company's characters, but the offerings will be designed to ""attract consumer attention and communicate the appeal of our platform."" The Wii U's Nintendo Network ID (NNID) log-in system, which the 3DS portable console only recently started supporting, will also be used across smartphones and tablets. Iwata spoke of the concept of a ""platform"" spanning devices, where an NNID would carry over between smartphones, current consoles, and future Nintendo systems, noting that the company's efforts in that regard so far have caused a ""division"" with customers.  Nintendo DS titles coming to Wii U Virtual Console Iwata stated that Nintendo will remain in the hardware business with traditional game consoles as the the main part of its strategy. ""We're not pessimistic about the future of dedicated video game platforms,"" he said. Nintendo will concentrate on creating Wii U titles that make better use of the tablet-style GamePad controller, which hasn't been exploited much to date. In particular, more software that uses the GamePad's NFC functionality will be announced at the E3 trade show in June, and Nintendo is working on a quick start-up mode that will let users boot directly into games from the GamePad without accessing the regular system menu. Nintendo DS titles will also be coming to the Wii U Virtual Console, with touchscreen play enabled on the GamePad. Meanwhile, Mario Kart 8, the latest entry in a series that isn't known for gameplay innovation but is almost guaranteed to move units, will go on sale for Wii U in May. Mysterious plans for 'non-wearable' technology Iwata also announced mysterious plans to make health and ""quality of life (QOL)"" a new focus for Nintendo, following on from its success with products like Wii Fit (and failure with vaporware like the Vitality Sensor). Cryptically, he said that the company would employ a ""leapfrog strategy,"" bypassing mobile phones and wearable technology with upcoming ""non-wearable"" technology that can provide experiences as yet unseen on Nintendo consoles. Iwata suggested that Nintendo would leverage its status as a gaming company to make personal health monitoring entertaining and engaging, and that the business could expand into areas such as education and lifestyle. Details of this ""QOL"" business will be announced within 2014, and it will be launched in the financial year beginning April 2015. The news comes the day after Nintendo’s Q3 2013 results, which saw the company post a profit over the holiday season but make no change in its forecast for a third consecutive annual loss. Earlier this month Nintendo reversed its prediction that it would swing to ¥100 billion in operating profit this fiscal year; the company now expects to lose ¥35 billion after dramatically slashing sales estimates for the struggling Wii U console. ""When you adapt too much, you lose what's unique about you."" Although calls for Nintendo to release games on mobile devices have persisted for years, the company has remained steadfast in its position that developing software exclusively for its own proprietary hardware guarantees the best experience. ""When you adapt too much, you lose what's unique about you,"" Iwata said yesterday. Nintendo executives did, however, telegraph signs of an evolving attitude over recent months, with NoA president Reggie Fils-Aime saying that the company was exploring simple gameplay on smart devices for marketing purposes, and Iwata said it was ""studying how smart devices can be used to grow the game-player business.""

Those fears never materialized, but the specter of a crackdown combined with congested data networks were enough to drive thousands to download FireChat — a smartphone application that lets users communicate without an internet connection. The app, which launched in March, has seen 500,000 downloads in Hong Kong since protests began on September 27th, driving it to the top spot on the Apple App Store and Google Play in Hong Kong. At its peak, FireChat saw 37,000 simultaneous users, each spending, on average, more than two and a half minutes on the app — and that’s not counting those who used the app offline. ""Our first reaction was okay, let's hope it works. And it did,"" says Christophe Daligault, chief marketing officer at Open Garden, the San Francisco-based company that developed FireChat. The last two weeks have been a whirlwind for Open Garden, which designed FireChat with festivals, technology conferences, and other events in mind — not necessarily protests. ""Most of us haven't slept much at all,"" Daligault adds.  Unlike WhatsApp and other messaging apps, FireChat doesn’t require an internet connection for users to communicate. Instead, it uses a phone’s Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals to connect it to other devices within a given range. In this setup, known as a mesh network, each phone acts as a node, and as more devices link together, the network’s range expands. Users can send texts and images under pseudonyms — another benefit for government-fearing protesters — though Open Garden recently introduced verified accounts for some journalists. The app gained attention at this year’s Burning Man festival, where attendees used it to organize and coordinate events in the middle of the Nevada desert, though it’s also been used in countries like Iran and Iraq, where the internet is aggressively censored, and during this year’s protests in Taiwan. But nothing compares to the flood of downloads it saw in Hong Kong — something that took Open Garden by surprise. ""We had no idea that it was going to be popular in those places,"" Daligault says. FireChat was created, he explains, with two use cases in mind: the developing world, where data plans are often prohibitively expensive, and live events or festivals, where cellular networks are usually congested and slow. ""FireChat is not a tool for private communications."" Ping Wong, secretary general of the Internet Society Hong Kong, was in Hong Kong as the demonstrations unfurled, and watched as chatrooms buzzed on FireChat. She says that many protesters continued to use Facebook and WhatsApp to coordinate events, whereas most messages sent on FireChat were ""reporting what’s happening in real-time, like where the police are and what they are doing,"" or calls for supplies like food and water. Laurel Chor, who covered the protests for the news site Coconuts Hong Kong, says FireChat wasn't as ubiquitous as other social-networking apps, though several demonstrators told her that it helped distinguish rumor from truth. The app's sudden popularity in Hong Kong has spurred downloads in other parts of the world, though it was never explicitly conceived as a protest tool. In fact, there are no real safeguards against government surveillance — a point that Daligault is quick to emphasize. ""FireChat is not a tool for private communications,"" Open Garden wrote in a Tumblr post this month. ""People who use Twitter understand that their communications are public. They can use pseudonyms and know that what they tweet may be seen by other people. It is the same with FireChat."" Chatting under pseudonyms may offer a sense of protection to protesters, though the app was never designed to guarantee anonymity. ""FireChat provides more or less about the same extent of identity protection as Twitter or Instagram,"" Stanislav Shalunov, Open Garden co-founder and CTO, said in an email. ""It is not specifically designed to provide some absolute protection of the user's identity."" ""I believe the government may be monitoring communications on FireChat, so as to know what's happening,"" Wong says. ""But I don't think the protesters fear the monitoring. Maybe you can say it is expected."" Encrypted private messaging is in the works The company plans to eventually introduce encrypted private messaging, though it’s not on the immediate horizon. On the surface, it would seem as if private messaging would threaten the openness that FireChat’s networks depend upon, but Daligault envisions the service as an add-on to the public chats, and believes it will actually expand the app’s user base in the long run. FireChat's download rates declined when protests began dwindling in Hong Kong last week, though Daligault says there's been no significant slowdown in activity. Tensions escalated once again this week, after government leaders abruptly cancelled negotiations with protesters, and flared on Wednesday, after video of a protester being beaten by police began spreading across the internet. It's not clear whether FireChat's popularity will sustain once things calm down in Hong Kong — the government said Thursday that it's ready to begin negotiations with student protesters — though Open Garden hopes its app will eventually extend beyond the realm of protests and civil unrest. ""I wish the app was known for other things,"" Daligault says, ""but so it is.""",0.4604016005020613,0.5395983994979388,0.8669923117532724,894,5.2785234899328861,474,6.3860759493670889,0,0,"Apps, Mobile, Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

""We regard the DEA's conduct to be a knowing and serious breach of Facebook's terms and policies,"" writes Sullivan. He adds that the social network ""asks that the DEA immediately confirm that it has ceased all activities on Facebook that involve the impersonation of others or that otherwise violate our terms and policies."" The issue came to the fore earlier this month when BuzzFeed reported on a case filed in a federal district court. The suspect, 28-year-old Sondra Arquiett, sued DEA agent Timothy Sinnigen for violating her privacy and putting her in harm's way. In court filings, the DEA admitted that Sinnigen used photos obtained from Arquiett's cell phone to create a phony Facebook account. ""A knowing and serious breach of Facebook's terms and policies."" The agency defended those actions, saying she ""implicitly consented by granting access to the information stored in her cell phone and by consenting to the use of that information to aid in an ongoing criminal investigations."" Arqiette, who was arrested in 2010, later pled guilty to charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and was sentenced to probation. She's asking for $250,000 in damages, according to the Associated Press. In response to the allegations, a DEA spokesperson tells the AP that it has ""launched a review"" into the matter, adding, ""that review is ongoing, but to our knowledge, this is not a widespread practice among our federal law enforcement agencies."" In recent years, Facebook has fought successfully to ensure that users on the service represent themselves with their ""real names."" The company won a legal battle last year to institute the policy in Germany, though earlier this month it found itself in hot water after cracking down on drag queens who used their stage names online. The company later clarified its policy to note that ""real names"" are the names people use in public, not necessarily their legal names. In any event, the DEA's use of Facebook breach the terms of use, and, as Sullivan writes, that company ""has long made clear that law enforcement authorities are subject to these policies.""

As of last night, the Chinese firewall is blocking all local connections to iCloud.com, redirecting those connections to a dummy site designed to look exactly like Apple's login page. (Update: A recent Apple statement has apparently confirmed the attack, announcing an ""intermittent organized network attacks"" without mentioning China specifically. The company has also changed iCloud.com's IP address, effectively circumventing the attack.) If you're using Firefox or Chrome, you'll land on a warning page like the one above, but if you're using Qihoo, the most popular browser in China, you'll be routed straight to the dummy site with no indication that it's not being run by Apple. A similar attack is also being leveled against Microsoft's Login.live.com, the company's gateway for all account logins. Instead of iCloud, users were directed to a dummy site  Because the attack is taking place at the level of the Great Firewall, it seems likely that this is an attack by Chinese authorities meant to harvest usernames and passwords. Great Fire also provided traceroutes and a wirecapture to verify the attacks. If a user logs into the dummy site, it will give the attackers complete access to the user's account, including any photos, text messages or emails stored in the cloud. Apple recently added default disk encryption to iOS, a feature that drew disapproval from the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, leading many to speculate that this attack might be a strike back against the company's new security efforts. It's still possible for users to circumvent the attack and get through to the real iCloud and login.live site unscathed. The attack only targeted one of iCloud's many IP addresses, so anyone routed to a different IP should reach the real site. A VPN service can also be used to redirect users, provided the VPN service is not also blocked by the Great Firewall. It's the first time China has directly attacked an Apple service, but Great Fire also notes that Apple has complied with the country's surveillance requests in the past. ""Apple has a long history of working with the Chinese authorities to self-censor content in China,"" Great Fire said in a statement.

Not an obvious choice for someone to manage a national healthcare crisis. But take a look under that robe and you’ll find that ""‘czar"" — at least in the context of American politics — is a relatively meaningless term, largely crafted by the media as convenient shorthand for long, cumbersome titles. It’s a blustery euphemism meant to inspire confidence when in fact, these czars are little more than run-of-the-mill government appointees, often faced with the same challenges as less imperious workers. Just like other employees, czars are eventually replaced, retire, or their positions are scrapped.

The leaks themselves required intense security measures, but editing and distributing the film has presented a challenge of its own. CitizenFour contains two separate stories which were held back until the film's carefully orchestrated premiere: one on industry infiltration in China and Germany and another on Snowden's girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, and her new residence in Moscow. Countless other secrets left behind in the editing room, and had to be protected throughout the process. Keeping that data under wraps for the past 18 months has been a herculean security undertaking, involving physical hard-drive handoffs, shared encryption accounts and at least one surgically modified laptop. We sat down with Laura Poitras this week to talk about the tools she used to keep it all safe.  All of our media was stored on encrypted drives, so you had to enter passwords and if the editing room ever got raided, they wouldn't get all of our outtakes. That's a lot of encrypted drives, but ultimately you enter a password when you turn on your computer, it's not that different than stuff you know. It just takes some time and you need someone who's devoted to it. And technically, it takes some time to do the encryption, but once it's there, it basically just operates like a hard drive. When we were finishing, we had a lot of people who were doing audio and we were a little bit careful about transferring anything just over the wire. We'd just drop it off. And everybody got on PGP to communicate, so we definitely trained a bunch of people on using encryption. We had to share cuts, so we had certain protocols, shared passwords that were decided in New York and then we'd move encrypted files using those shared passwords. It does add a level of complexity but the negative consequences are so bad that you have to do it.   I definitely compartment different computers for different tasks. There's an air gap for documents. There's a Tails machine that's been sort of…a lot of things have been removed from it, just soldered off. Microphones, all the extras. And then I have one that I actually use the internet on. And of course I use software like Tor for internet browsing. But I did that long before Snowden. After I came back from meeting Snowden in Hong Kong, I went back to Berlin and I just put my cell phone away. I figured it just wasn't a good thing for me to have for a number of reasons. It's a microphone and it's also a tracking device and I just thought…I'm just not going to broadcast it. So I stopped using a cell phone while I was editing, but now I'm in here doing distribution and I need to talk to people so I've got a cell phone again. Once you come to terms with the risks, then the choices are pretty simple. It's just safety, and any way you would approach safety in any other context. Just, ""oh that's dangerous. Your cellphone is dangerous in this situation."" It becomes kind of intuitive. If we were talking about a sensitive situation, I would just say, okay let's take the computers out of the room. It just becomes an obvious thing to do as a precaution.   When the first emails came in from Snowden, he asked for my key and I gave him my key and then he asked questions about my computer, making sure that it was secure. And then I got a bit of information and as soon as I got a bit of information I thought, okay I need to get on another system.

After a lengthy period away, both Rock Band and Guitar Hero are making a return to the virtual stage this year. But while plastic guitars and drum sets are what most people think of when they reminisce about rhythm games, sometimes you just want something smaller. The upcoming Loud on Planet X looks to be just that. ""Rock Band or Guitar Hero are like the stadium experience,"" says creative producer Alex Jansen. ""We're kind of the little bar where you discover your favorite band for the first time."" Loud on Planet X is perhaps best described as Plants vs. Zombies mashed together with PSP cult classic Patapon. Alien creatures will approach you from the right, marching down four different lanes, and you'll need to stop them from reaching the band playing on stage. Doing so is remarkably simple; for the most part, all you need to do is tap the rows in time to the beat to fire blasts at the bad guys. The key is keeping time and managing the ever-increasing hordes of aliens coming your way. There are also power-ups that can ease the onslaught a bit, including a bouncer who will temporarily hold back aliens and a smoke machine that slows them down. ""We're kind of the little bar where you discover your favorite band for the first time."" It doesn't make you feel like you're playing a crazy guitar solo — and that's kind of the point. ""A lot of games try to recreate the feeling of making music,"" explains Jansen. ""But what we've embraced is that it's less about creating the song, and more like you're driving your car and tapping the steering wheel in time to it."" Just like games like Elite Beat Agents or PaRappa the Rapper, it's just another way to engage with some really great music. And Planet X has quite the lineup of musicians, boasting artists ranging from Tegan and Sara and Lights to Fucked Up and Broken Social Scene.   Right now the game features nine artists and 18 songs, but developed Pop Sandbox is currently in the midst of a Kickstarter campaign to expand the scope a bit. No matter what, the plan is to launch the game this fall, but if the crowdfunding is successful the soundtrack will jump to 24 songs from 12 different artists. When it does arrive, Planet X is slated to launch on PS4, Vita, Steam, iOS, and Android, with other platforms like Wii U possible depending on how the Kickstarter goes. ""We've tried to have a really curated list of headliners and emerging artists."" The game is a drastic departure for the Toronto-based studio, which isn't strictly a game developer. The group has created everything from a non-fiction graphic novel about infamous Toronto bike thief Igor Kenk, to a mobile game called Pipe Trouble that aimed to raise awareness about fracking and the dangers of exploiting natural gas. Pipe Trouble also featured a soundtrack from punk band Fucked Up, so when the idea for Planet X first popped up, the studio had a place to start when it came to courting musicians. From there, Jansen says, the bands themselves actually helped sell other artists on working on the game; Broken Social Scene's Brendan Canning in particular was a strong champion of the project. The result is a diverse lineup, but not just in terms of style of music. ""The most strategic thing that we've tried to do, is we've tried to have a really curated list of headliners and emerging artists,"" explains Jansen. ""Hopefully someone might come to it because they know Tegan and Sara, but they're going to walk away discovering July Talk."" And while the return of the two biggest music games means that there's increased competition for Planet X, the game is different enough that Jansen believes they can be complimentary experiences. ""Hopefully it just gets people thinking about music games more, and playing music games more.""",0.6280389100383719,0.37196108996162813,0.4886053587665867,663,4.7149321266968327,379,5.6094986807387865,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Sansa Stark and Ramsay Snow went ahead and made it official in the Godswood (+20 each) and celebrated, as is tradition, in the North with a controversial rape scene! (+20 each ... ?) Can I even give points for something this unpleasant? (Answer: no.) Of course, far away on the distant continent of Blogospheros, many would argue that this is the point at which not only Ramsay ""lost the show"" but the show ""lost touch with humanity."" I was rather hoping for Sansa to shiv Ramsay right in the assault kit, but the symbolic black dye has been washed out of her hair (side note: how long has she gone without a shampoo, then?), and without her mentor in deviousness Littlefinger around, she's lost her newly acquired cynical 'tude. Instead, the best we can hope for at this point is a ""the fucked becomes the fucker"" (ugh) plot line, which is hardly original territory for Thrones, or, you know, any old exploitation film. Can I even give points for something this unpleasant? At least she got to lay down the law for a moment with her would-be (and probably still will-be) tormentor Miranda. ""I'm Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home, and you can't frighten me,"" she declares to Ramsay's visibly stunned sidekick / piece. (+10) It worked for the moment, not that it matters much — Miranda's not exactly her biggest problem right now.   Still, props to Sansa for having stayed completely off the grid since leaving King's Landing — judging by Cersei's disbelief at her continued existence and current residence in Winterfell. Both Stark girls have been working at becoming No One this season, Arya Stark perhaps more literally than her older sister. This week she got another step closer to that goal, and unlocked a whole new dungeon in the House of Black and White! I'm gonna go ahead and call it a promotion — or at least a workplace upgrade. (+25) Arya also Valar Morghulis'ed some poor sick kid with the water from the death fountain (+10) ... yeah, I'm starting to have a hard time following this thread, too. Cock merchants! Near-constant rape! Behold, the magical fantasy world of George R.R. Martin! I suppose it's worth noting that this was yet another Meereen-free episode, and that's okay, as long as Daenerys is using this time to plan her wedding to Mr. zo Loraq. But now it seems we're mostly just biding our time and waiting for Jorah and Tyrion to arrive on her pyramid steps. That has been both expedited and complicated this week with their capture by slave traders, who intend to take both our dudes to Meereen — how convenient for Tyrion, once again! The traders' goals are twofold: to sell Tyrion's dick to a ""cock merchant"" (Cock merchants! Near-constant rape! Behold, the magical fantasy world of George R.R. Martin!) and to throw Jorah into Daenerys' newly reopened fighting pits. I smell a dramatic reunion! Do you guys think Jorah and Dany are OTP? [  ] Yes [  ] No. You guys, what if Showgirls took place in Westeros Also, where is Varys in all this? Being faux-Daenerys' sassy best friend with great fashion sense, and supporting her dreams as she tries to break out of the brothels and into the big time? Oh my god, what if Showgirls took place in Westeros? God, I'd rather be watching that show this week. Anyway, back to this week's much drearier proceedings. Kewl #teens Trystane Martell and Myrcella are M.O.ing in the water gardens when they are walked in on by Jaime and Bronn. Ugh, daaaaad/uncllllle! They're soon joined by Trystane's totally psychotic cousins, and everyone fights and flails around for a while more or less yelling ""hiii-ya"" at each other until they're stopped by Doran's axe-wielding butler.   I'm bored and not feeling very charitable to this show this week, so — ominous horns! — I'm going to go ahead and punch the ""boring side plot"" demerit button, not only for Jaime and Bronn, but for all the Sand Snakes as well. We're six episodes in, and I am not sold on all the hype about Oberyn's daughters. They take themselves way too seriously, they're not nearly scary enough (only one kill between the three of them this season, and he was a redshirt buried to his neck in sand — very low difficulty level), and they all have very belabored ""foreign sounding"" accents. I dunno. Prove me wrong, ladies, prove me wrong. I am not at all sold on the Sand Snakes This -10 score will be applied to each character for every episode the Sand Snakes, Bronn, and Jaime have made an appearance since the Dorne mission subplot kicked off. It will continue to be automatically applied until the plot itself either ends or gives us some proper payoff. So right now, that's -30 each for Bronn and Jaime, and -20 each for Obara, Tyene, and Nym. Deepest apologies to those of you who had these guys drafted, nobody thought you were wrong in the preseason.   Is Lady Olenna the Cookie Lyon of Game of Thrones? At least there was one ray of sunlight this week: Lady Olenna Motherfucking Tyrell made her triumphant return to King's Landing, with a banger of an opening line (""You can smell the shit from five miles away"" — +5). Is Olenna the Cookie Lyon of Game of Thrones? God, I wish. There were so many scenes I would have had her walk into this week, teetering on some imported Volantian stilettos and examining her manicure, and interrupting the conversation with something irreverent and cutting. (""Arya, girl, what are you doing wasting your time with these many-bitch-faces? We got a hit record to make!"") Olenna and Cersei got one nice little tête-à-tête in (""Put the pen down, we know you're not writing anything"" — once again, Olenna speaks for the people, +5), but this didn't last long before Cersei's long con to get rid of the Tyrells finally came into full flower, so to speak, with the Faith Militant convicting both Loras and Margaery of generalized immorality. I hated this! (And seriously, -15 to royal dud Tommen for just sitting there and letting it happen.) I just hope Cersei has a Dark Knight moment before she has her rival's head chopped off or whatever she plans on doing — she shouldn't have her killed, because she's just too much fun! I don't think Cersei realizes how much life Margaery gives her, how much she focuses all her negative energy and anger, like a beautiful, doll-like prism. Someone like that can be very useful and healthy to have in one's life! Cersei, please reconsider. It's like your thrice-removed long-lost Lannister cousin Taylor Swift says: ""You know I love the players, and you love the game."" Killing Margaery will only make everyone unhappy, and it might force me to just toss the entire Game of Game of Thrones board out the window like a morose little baby who needs a nap. (Haha, ""like."") In closing: Holy shit, look at how bad this week was!

The downright mad, or perhaps even furious article was picked up on The Mary Sue, CNN, The Hollywood Reporter, The A/V Club, and other sites, frequently under the headline that men's rights advocates were boycotting Mad Max.

Mostly, the piece was an excuse to turn the snark fire hoses on full blast, particularly because author Aaron Clarey had not only called one of the most famous Australian films of all time a piece of American culture, he'd extrapolated his entire critique from trailers and interviews. The subtext was that this was a weird overreaction to someone finally making a movie where female characters — even just one ""unrealistic"" female character, namely the tough, shaven-headed Imperator Furiosa — could hold their own. How can you tell a universal experience from an overused trope? Outside the manosphere, though, we're having the same basic debate about Game of Thrones, whose frequent rape scenes spurred The Mary Sue to start a real boycott of the show. We're talking about what actually reflects human experience in fiction, and what's just an overused trope, an idea we've seen so many times that we confuse it for reality. And whether you're there for the narrative themes or the car chases, Fury Road is a film that actively deflates one of misogynists' most treasured fantasies. Like Westeros, the apocalypse is supposed to be where women's freedom goes to die. Most people don't think that's a good thing as much as internet anti-feminists seem to, but it's a major theme in mainstream science fiction like The Stand, in which the female protagonist gives an extended internal monologue about how ""women's lib ... was nothing more nor less than the outgrowth of the technological society."" One of the rare female characters in Cormac McCarthy's novel The Road (played by Fury Road's Charlize Theron, actually, in the film adaptation) is so genre-savvy that she immediately kills herself rather than live after the apocalypse, and the other women appear most prominently as the possessions of warlords. Mad Max has always had a complicated relationship with this. The first film is all about a man trying and failing to protect his wife, and there's an abrupt and graphic rape scene in The Road Warrior. But as others have pointed out, it's got a history of female fighters, and it distributes its victimhood fairly even-handedly, even if it was mostly a series of movies about men. Apocalypses are supposed to be where women's freedom goes to die Fury Road, though, explicitly balances Max's journey with a story about women and women's agency. Furiosa is almost a red herring here, because any piece of fiction can assimilate a single powerful female character. The real threat is that even the women who are everything anti-feminists smugly predict — enslaved, fragile, sheltered — can be brave and competent. For all the complaints about women being too physically strong, the really ""unrealistic"" difference is that they're not broken or terrified. In fact, they're probably less broken than the men chasing them. There's a feminist concept usually summed up as ""the patriarchy hurts men too"" — the idea that our gender stereotypes end up limiting everyone, not just women. Fury Road plays this out very literally. Villain Immortan Joe's patriarchal society privileges and is run by men. His ""warboys"" seem well above women in the food chain, set to enter Valhalla when they die. They're also short-lived, interchangeable, and desperate for approval. Nux (better known as the ""what a lovely day"" kid in the Mad Max trailers) has a fragile and violent masculinity that makes him deadly, but the moment he slips up, he loses everything. Parts of the men's rights movement worry about this too. One early men's movement book refers to men as the ""disposable sex,"" pushed into high-risk jobs and defined by their earning capacity. But their answer usually seems to involve doubling down on the same old stereotypes. In Fury Road, there's a way out, and it's rejecting Joe's empire altogether. When Nux encounters the ""wives,"" they're the ones who end up trying to help him — not because of women's civilizing influence, but because they already understand how rigged the system is. The patriarchy hurts warboys too Fury Road is built around pregnancy, the thing that supposedly makes women incapable of surviving the apocalypse on their own. Women are vulnerable because of their status as childbearers here, but once they escape, it's also presented as a weird kind of power. Mother's milk is one of the desert's few viable foods, and the wives protect Max and Furiosa by using their pregnant bodies as human shields. Immortan Joe isn't trying to get back his pleasure harem so much as he is frantically hunting for something he can never get by himself: an heir. Maybe most importantly, the movie doesn't just try to avoid making women's subjugation titillating, it rarely gives the audience the satisfaction of seeing it at all. And that's a huge step. It's a step away from Game of Thrones, which embraces and aestheticizes abuse in the name of realism. It's a step away from some explicitly feminist apocalypses — books like Margaret Atwood's MaddAddam trilogy, which embraces and aestheticizes abuse in the name of criticism. It breaks the rule that in order to tell a story about women overcoming suffering, you have to make sure everybody can see for themselves, over and over, just how bad the suffering really was. If you're the sort of person who wants to watch the suffering and skip the recovery, you'll be gravely disappointed. Clarey is right: Fury Road isn't realistic. But neither are almost any of our other apocalyptic fantasies, including Return of Kings editor Roosh V's final-stage feminist takeover in which ""roaming witch mobs actively surveil and monitor men who hint at having normal levels of testosterone."" They're all stories we — modern men and women enmeshed in a delicate network of social connections — tell ourselves about which human beings should be treated as human beings, which ones get to control their own lives. And the stories we pick, no matter who we are, can either destroy us or make us strong.

If you haven’t tuned in recently, you’ve been missing out. The show ends with a strong final few weeks, though not for the reason fans of the Top Ten or Letterman’s classic monologues might think. The later years of Late Show haven’t met the comedy threshold established by the show’s early, borderline surreal episodes. Most Centennials (shudder) won’t remember watching Letterman live and laughing, and if they do know a good bit from the host, they probably saw it archived on YouTube. But one aspect of the show has remained consistent, through good years and not so good years: the music.  We aren’t the first to highlight the marketing power of David Letterman (and whoever books musical guests). He’s brought attention to countless worthy bands that don’t typically get radio play or advertisement deals. He’s shaped the mainstream, from early performances by REM to that recent-ish barnburner by Future Islands. You can read many eloquent recaps of the best performances and breakdowns of what Letterman’s show meant to music. And you should. On a personal level, I can remember how much it meant seeing childhood friends, The Republic Tigers, appear on the show. To me, they had made it. What I haven’t seen mentioned though, and what I think is worth your attention today, are the incredible performances musicians have given to Letterman in the past couple months as special goodbyes. Some of the host's favorite artists have appeared and hoisted up his favorite songs. Last night, Bob Dylan sang ""The Night We Called It a Day,"" the night before that Eddie Vedder did ""Better Man,"" and a couple nights before that Norah Jones sang ""Don’t Know Why."" They are the extra oomph the show needed and deserved in these final days. Hootie and the Blowfish, John Fogerty, Elvis Costello, Chaka Khan, Steve Martin: the list of guests is almost a joke in and of itself, but speaks to Letterman’s broad music palate. Last month, John Mayer showed up and performed all 10 minutes of ""American Pie,"" pushing every word through his raspy, fried throat. The day before Mayer, one of Letterman’s favorite singers sang one of his favorite songs. Here’s Tracey Chapman doing ""Stand By Me.""  I will miss Letterman’s comedy, but I have new shows that will fill the hole he leaves behind: Colbert being the immediate follow-up, but also John Oliver who is changing what a late night show can be on HBO. Who on television, however, will take-up the title of Music Ambassador, guiding the coolest young bands into the bedrooms of out-of-touch folks like me as they drift into sleep?",0.6485043463677612,0.3514956536322388,0.24894819240525176,464,4.9784482758620694,309,5.592233009708738,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The company has spent a lot of time working on ways to make sure it surfaces interesting and relevant content — but no matter how good its algorithms are, there's a good chance that your page is often littered with stuff from ""friends"" you're not that close with and pages you've liked over the years that you can't remember liking in the first place. That's why Facebook is rolling out a new set of controls that make it a lot easier to see more of what's relevant to you in your News Feed — and perhaps more importantly, it makes it easier to banish things you don't care about. In Facebook's iOS app, there's now a new News Feed preferences tool that presents you with four simple tools. The first is entirely new to Facebook: you can now select pages and friends that will show up at the top of your News Feed every time you load it up so you don't miss updates you always want to see.   The next two settings expand upon the ""unfollow"" feature that lets you stay friends with people without seeing their inane rants or horrible links on your News Feed every morning. (You're probably just better off taking the plunge and de-friending these people altogether, but we've obviously reached a point in society where that's just too aggressive a move for a lot of people.) There's now a tool that lets you zip through all the people you're friends with and add them to your ""unfollow"" list — it's a lot easier than the current process for unfollowing someone. Silence that friend who just can't stop sharing terrible links On the flip side, there's also an area that lets you see everyone you've unfollowed and add them back into your feed. Helpfully, it tells you when you unfollowed them — so if someone's been in your Facebook time out for three years, you can easily know that and give them another shot if you wish. The last new tool is a discovery option to find new pages to follow, based on pages you've liked in the past. On the surface, it doesn't quite seem to fit as well with the other options, but Facebook said its overarching goal with the new settings is to make your News Feed show you things you care about across the board — whether that means making it so your favorite friends and pages show up at the top of your feed, removing friends whose posts you don't want to see, or adding pages that show you content you care about.   As someone whose own news feed has gotten rather unruly over the years, this seems like a pretty smart way of dealing with the digital baggage longtime Facebook users have accrued over the years. While most of these features aren't truly new, having them all in one place to access will likely make power-washing your News Feed a lot easier than it used to be.

Lytro has revamped the camera's entire UI and menu system, added focus aids to help with the buggy tap-to-focus feature, and increased the speed of the autofocus. To improve the stability of the camera's software, Lytro reduced the camera's buffer — the max number of images you can take in a row before the camera has to take a break — from 10 images to eight. It's a necessary sacrifice considering how continuous shooting often crashed the camera's original software.

Here in New York City, my day is filled with screeching brakes, truck pistons, sidewalk chatter, and the dull drone of window air conditioners. And when I go to a concert, the volume, mix, and quality of the sound can subconsciously affect how much I actually enjoy the evening. Noah Kraft, CEO and co-founder of Doppler Labs, thinks about these issues a lot, and he believes his company can improve our lives with what he calls ""hearables."" Ask Kraft what the goal of Doppler is, and he says, ""we want to put a computer, speaker, and mic in everyone's ear."" That's precisely the idea behind Doppler's Here Active Listening System. Here is a pair of small battery-powered buds (I suppose you could call them Here buds) with a microphone, a speaker, and a near-zero-latency digital sound processor (DSP) designed to alter, in real time, the way we hear the world. Here is not a hearing aid, it's not a Bluetooth headset Kraft is adamant about what Here is not. It isn't a hearing aid, it isn't a Bluetooth headset, and it isn't a sound recorder. The primary goal of the system is to enhance the sound of live performances, custom tailored to the listener's own preferences and perspective. It's a niche product aimed at audiophiles who really care about the way things sound. Here aims to enhance live audio in three ways. First, there's a simple volume control. The microphones take input from the world, and Here either attenuates or amplifies the overall volume. Second, Here can apply a suite of equalizer effects to emphasize or suppress certain frequencies in the sound spectrum. The system will also target specific frequencies with anti-noise to further suppress, say, the frequencies of a baby crying, or an overactive hi-hat cymbal in a live mix. Lastly, Here also comes with a set of effects like flange, reverb, delay, fuzz, and bitcrusher to further mess with the world around you. You control all of this through a smartphone app, which sends your settings to the buds via Bluetooth. However, all the processing occurs in the buds themselves; the app is simply a remote control for Here.   I tried a prototype of the system, and I have to say it's a pretty intense experience, if a bit unpolished at the moment. The effects certainly work; removing high frequencies in the room we were in de-emphasized the whir of the air conditioning, and adding bass to a roving banjo in the Doppler office beefed up the sound. These changes would certainly be useful at a concert if the mix is sloppy. The sensation of quickly turning on cavernous reverb during a conversation is trippy and fun, even if it does amount to what's ultimately a gimmick. I could see some subtle effects being useful in a small jazz club, to add ambience to a dead room, but I can't see myself applying fuzz or bitcrusher to any live performance at all. One interesting thing about Here is that it somehow preserves the directionality of sound. The buds are close enough to the inside of the ear that you can still pick up front / back and left / right differences. It is difficult to have a conversation while wearing them, however, since they fall victim to the occlusion effect, where your own voice resonates through your skull. Here is specifically designed for concertgoers, not conversationalists. The low latency of the buds is impressive, too — there was absolutely no lag in the sound coming to my ears. There are some issues with the early prototypes I tried, though. There's a thin layer of grainy noise underneath everything, like a bad cable running to an overdriven guitar amp. The pair I tried also had trouble with high-volume input, and they'd clip and distort anything above a normal spoken level. I would chalk these problems up to very early hardware; Here is still over six months away from shipping.   The problem I'm most concerned about, however, is the seal between the buds and my ear. Even though the final version will come with three rubber tip sizes, I found it very difficult to get a good seal. This is important, because in order for things like overall volume control to work, Here needs to be able to work in complete isolation from the outside world. I tried on models of the retail versions, and I still felt like there was a lot of sound leaking in, either around or through the rubber. If these complaints seem picky, that's because they are If these complaints seem picky, that's because they are — and they should be for this type of product. Here is certainly a niche product, but that's by design. The goal is to develop a product for true audiophiles who will act as ambassadors for in-ear wearables. This was the strategy with Doppler's first product, Dubs, which were simple earplugs aimed at music fans. Dubs were a gateway product for the company, and Here is the next step in a slow progression toward bionic ears. That's not to say Here hasn't seen much interest. Doppler launched the product on Kickstarter, and the campaign raised over $635,000 — more than double its goal. The company also received $17 million in series B funding just this week. Doppler is playing a slow and steady game, and hopefully that funding and cautious pace will help it succeed. Here will retail for $250 when it eventually comes to market, and Kraft indicates that it's a fairly low-margin product. The company's goal right now is simply to get Here into as many influential ears as possible and start a conversation about in-ear wearables. I'm excited to see where Here goes. Nothing else I've seen is attempting anything this ambitious, even if it is for a niche audience. The prototype is promising, and the final product is still about six months away. The idea of having a computer in your ear is extremely compelling, and I'm looking forward to the possibilities it opens up. If Here succeeds, we could see live performances specifically designed to interact with in-ear processing, or downloadable sound profiles for live venues. And if Doppler continues to build in-ear systems, we may someday have tiny virtual assistants in our ears, or real-time translation piped into our heads. But for now, I'll be satisfied turning up the bass at the next concert I go to.

The current suit reportedly weighs just 10 pounds, but right now it seems to mainly be useful for holding light objects in place.  ""From the wearer's perspective, it behaves like an extension of his own body."" Because the robotic limbs are meant to augment actual arms, they have to be controlled by something else.

The system, called the ""Dismounted Soldier Training System"" or DSTS, used a head-mounted display and a laptop worn inside a military backpack to immerse soldiers in a virtual learning environment similar to a military video game. Now that same company is turning its attention to the civilian world with a system it simply calls ""Medical Simulation."" And the company says it might soon help train healthcare professionals for difficult surgeries, disaster response, and could even be used to treat people who suffer from PTSD.  Medical Simulation could recreate the Boston Marathon bombing Like its military counterpart, ID's Medical Simulation will allow groups of people to train in highly realistic virtual environments. For example, Medical Simulation could recreate events such as the Boston Marathon bombing or Hurricane Sandy to better prepare first responders in large cities. ""We need first responders to be able to handle the chaos of that event, the fast triage, the assessment of casualties,"" says Eric Rohde, chief strategist of medical simulations at Intelligent Decisions. Before the start of each training session, up to nine first responders will stand in a large, bare room. When they don the display visor, Rohde explains, they will be fully immersed inside a game world that includes visual, auditory, and even atmospheric conditions like dust or rain, replicating the chaos and situational challenges of an emergency. As the user moves through the room, her movements are represented by an avatar to other players. ""You see them as their avatar, you communicate, you give orders, and you assess wounds as if it's in a real-world setting.""  The DSTS visor (Intelligent Decisions) Rohde says that Medical Simulation will still fit the needs of the US military, but its development is being driven by civilian medical communities, as evidenced by the company's partnership with Baylor Health Care System. ""In the case of Baylor, what we're progressing toward is a multi-person, full immersive game environment that trains teams"" based on the medical requirements of various scenarios, such as mass casualty events. the system can train the user to ignore distractions Medical Simulation also generates a ton of data thanks to a plethora of biosensors that can track a user's gaze, blood pressure, and heart rate. That data can be used to analyze a person's reaction to the situations she encounters and to tailor the simulation accordingly. If a user is failing to control a crowd or ignoring certain cues about who's more injured — looking at the uninjured person yelling at the top of her lungs, for instance, instead of the person passed out right next to her — the system can train the user to focus and ignore distractions. The system will also make it possible for drills to take place in extremely realistic settings. Users can make the simulation perfectly resemble an actual building or room to ensure that the training is accurate. ""It could look exactly like the operating room that they work in every day,"" Rohde says, ""right down to the color of the walls, the textures, and the machines that are there.""   The DSTS environment (Intelligent Decisions) What is perhaps most exciting about Medical Simulation, however, is its ability to integrate mannequins and actors into the virtual reality simulation — a capability that Intelligent Decisions had begun to explore with DSTS, but has not yet fully integrated into the system. ""I can bring in a real person, lay them on a real table — which you see inside the virtual environment — and we can make it look as if the real person is bleeding, as if they have a wound,"" Rohde says. First responders can apply pressure on what appears to be a real wound and carry actual people around, making the virtual world both more lifelike and more instructional. a valuable tool for treating people with PTSD Beyond the medical training applications, Intelligent Decisions thinks that the technology will be a valuable tool for treating people with PTSD — a possibility that some researchers are already exploring with Oculus Rift. ""We have the ability to take the sufferer back to a very specific corner in Baghdad — or wherever,"" Rohde says, to perform exposure therapy. ""Slowly and carefully exposing [people with PTSD] to the traumatic event in a narrative form is an effective way of reducing post-traumatic symptoms,"" says Aaron Krasner, a psychiatrist at Silver Hill Hospital in Connecticut who isn't affiliated with Intelligent Decisions. Medical Simulation will allow clinicians to see what patients are looking at during simulations, Rohde says, and to realize that ""their heart rate jumped to 15 beats a minute when they saw this thing — so we know that's a trigger for them."" In the hands of a skilled psychotherapist, Krasner says, it could be ""a responsible use of technology."" Unfortunately, ID's Medical Simulation platform isn't ready for prime time yet. ""It's not in a place where we could hand you software,"" Rohde says. But the company thinks the system could make it to market within the next two years, depending on the level of funding it receives. As for cost, Rohde wouldn't name a number, but he said that the price will be ""institutionally affordable,"" and will likely vary depending on a facility's requirements. ""It's not going to be millions of dollars. It's not going to be hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's going to be something less than that,"" he says. ""To buy DSTS is no small ticket, but to buy the system we're developing will be affordable — and ideally it will be affordable down to the clinic level.""",0.5897339270270976,0.4102660729729024,0.8813129735008229,968,5.0609504132231402,486,6.3580246913580245,0,0,"Science, Tech, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I can draw a perfect circle with my eyes closed, calculate Pi to the nth degree, split a 15 percent tip seven ways, and accurately measure how many calories are going in and out of my body. Or can I? A frenzy for quantifying everything about the human body is sweeping the electronics industry — with Apple's HealthKit and Samsung's SAMI being the latest and most prominent efforts — and catalyzing an explosion of sensor-laden wearable devices. But in its hurry toward a more self-aware future, this wave of innovation is also perpetuating one of the big mistakes of the past: counting calories. As food historian Martin Bruegel explains, the obsession with calories got its start at the turn of the 20th century as part of a broad ""scientific eating"" movement focused on figuring out ways to help the poor eat well. Over time, that concern moved from the political to the personal, culminating in the 1997 introduction of the Weight Watchers Points program. That globally popular dieting regimen elevated the calculation and tracking of calories into a weird blend of pseudoscience and ersatz religion, asking adherents to follow the numbers with unquestioning faith. Even Weight Watchers now accepts that calorie counting's a bad idea That’s where the pre-digital world went wrong. ""As the co-author of a book called Why Calories Count, I might be expected to favor calorie counting but I most definitely do not. It cannot be done accurately or even close to accurately,"" noted NYU nutritionist Marion Nestle tells The Verge. In November 2010, then-president and CEO of Weight Watchers David Kirchhoff conceded that point and admitted that ""calorie-counting has become unhelpful"" for people trying to lose weight. Citing the myriad variables that go into working out how much energy is in your food and how much of it you can actually digest, his company completely reworked its program. In spite of a widespread professional unease about getting too specific with calories, that’s exactly what new technology is doing. The problem is that standards for accuracy and reliability of consumer health gadgets are not as strict as those for professional use because, well, they don’t exist. The US Federal Trade Commission investigates and takes action against allegations of false advertising or misleading claims, but that’s about as far as it goes. Pretty much anyone can introduce ""the next great health invention,"" and with the help of crowdfunding platforms like Indiegogo, many are trying. A million dollars. That’s how much faith the internet has put in the promise of Healbe GoBe, an Indiegogo project that has raised as many red flags as funding pledges. This wrist-worn device claims to combine pressure and hydration sensors with an accelerometer to accurately quantify both the calories you’ve taken in and the calories you’ve burned. The key metric being measured by the GoBe wearable is said to be glucose concentration in the blood, though Healbe’s own literature on the subject admits it ""doesn’t meet medical accuracy requirements."" If it did, it’d be a revolution for diabetics, but the fact it doesn’t isn’t stopping the company from promoting it to people desperate for a new method to lose weight. Beyond calories, Healbe’s claims grow increasingly outlandish: it’ll also tell you the macronutrient (fats, carbohydrates, and protein) composition of the last meal you ate and monitor your stress levels.  You can train for years to become a nutritionist or pay $2.99 for an app that will guess the calories for you The $2.99 Meal Snap app follows a similar path by offering to calculate the caloric content of your food through ""pure magic."" You take a photo of your plate, upload it, and the app returns an estimate of how many calories sit in front of you. The entire mysterious process appears to actually be a case of manual photo analysis that matches the results to the food database of Daily Burn, the app’s maker. Meal Snap is not without merit, as it helps users keep a visual food diary over time, but its results have been shown to fluctuate wildly. The calorie content of anything you eat will vary, sometimes dramatically, according to how it’s cooked, plus a proportion of a meal’s energy is always lost to bacteria inside the gut and the digestive process itself. All this complexity is lost when you have a person being paid a few cents per photo identifying it as ""chicken with small bits."" This creates a dissonance between perceived and real accuracy. When you’re told that ""that piece of bread has 113.95 calories,"" as in the demo video for The Situ Smart Food Nutrition Scale, the extra decimal places suggest precision. But all you’re doing is weighing each ingredient in your meal and then assigning it a generic caloric value for that typical food. You think you’re adding 100 calories of ham and 32 — no, let’s do two slices — 69 calories in the form of cheese, but those are estimates, a guide rather than a hard rule. Like the GoBe, the Situ has met with crowdfunding success, this time through Kickstarter, but like Meal Snap, it seems to be focusing on the wrong thing. The lack of precision in self-reported food consumption is ""legendary"" The common thread that runs through calorie-counting apps and gadgets is that we, as humans, are not very good at it. Professor Nestle describes the lack of precision in self-reported food consumption as ""legendary,"" citing an average underestimation of 30 percent. But the same pitfalls that sabotage pen-and-paper calorie tracking also affect the digital kind: you’re still just as likely to neglect documenting late-night snacks as you ever were. In the absence of an automated solution like the GoBe that actually works, technology’s just fancying up an inherently faulty process of self-quantification. Measuring the expenditure of energy — the other side of the caloric equation — has produced a wider range of automatic devices, but not much more accuracy. Most pedometers struggle to keep an accurate step count, never mind calculating the exact energy consumption of a given day’s exertions. Dr. Alice Ammerman from the University of North Carolina's nutrition department says that ""probably the most useful health-promoting information from these devices is to show that it takes a lot of physical activity to ‘burn off’ a candy bar or soda, or other high-calorie food."" It'd be okay for every device to be wrong if they were all wrong by the same amount Another significant advantage of fitness trackers like the Nike FuelBand is that they allow for comparison: you can track your personal development over time, compare times with others online, or just measure yourself against a general standard. That doesn’t strictly need to be accurate, it just has to be consistent. And it is, provided you only ever use Nike products, but the legion of other fitness monitors on the market don’t count Fuel points and don’t adhere to any other universal standard for measurement. Apple’s newly introduced HealthKit proposes to rectify one of these issues by centralizing data from all wearable devices into one hub, but it doesn’t yet offer a solution for the problem of inconsistency. A recent test by Quartz found an average disparity of over 500 calories per day between some activity trackers. In the absence of standards, people resort to calories as the common denominator for cross-comparisons, using that seemingly scientific measurement in a way that’s far from scientifically rigorous. You can’t balance your diet properly with a Situ scale and a Samsung Gear Fit — even though both purport to track calories — because they use different methods and produce different errors in their final numbers.  Dr. Barry Popkin, a colleague of Professor Ammerman’s at UNC and the author of The World is Fat, agrees with her and Marion Nestle in warning against the dangers of even small errors of estimation when relying on calories to guide lifestyle choices. ""The issue is in how do people use them,"" he says, ""and do the Fitbits, etc., overestimate movement."" A system that consistently miscalculates energy use risks being falsely reassuring or forcing the user into an unnecessarily restrictive diet. You’re better off, argues Nestle, buying a scale to weigh yourself and judging whether to eat more or less by looking at whether you’re gaining or losing weight. It’s a breathtakingly basic approach, but until the technology to achieve true ""scientific eating"" matures, it’s the best option on the table. Samsung and Apple could bring order to the data chaos Aside from issues of accuracy and consistency, the crucial missing element from wearable health gadgets today is user education. Knowing the limitations of biotelemetry and how to interpret it properly is fundamental to making good use of that information. Samsung’s new Simband prototype is essentially a portable clinic, tracking every imaginable health parameter, but its most useful promise is the ability to share its findings with your doctor. Apple’s HealthKit similarly aims to act as a digital library of self-quantification data that’s accessible to health care providers. Dr. John Noseworthy, CEO of the Mayo Clinic, says it ""will revolutionize how the health industry interacts with people."" Both Samsung and Apple’s efforts have the potential to be transformative. Being the two biggest companies in personal electronics, they can set real standards for accuracy and reporting that others would be willing to follow. Instead of do-it-yourself calorie comparisons, people would have access to professional clinical assessments. But the road to making that vision a reality is long and we’re only just getting started.

Shulgin's psychedelics were tested on himself, his wife, and friends In several decades of research, Shulgin reportedly estimated that he had created over 200 psychedelic compounds, which he researched and published results on. Those compounds were usually tested by Shulgin himself and — depending on the results — might expand to tests on his wife, Ann, and a group of friends. Shulgin was largely able to avoid a Drug Enforcement Agency crackdown simply because most of the drugs that he worked on hadn't previously existed outside of his lab, and therefore weren't illegal yet. Eventually though, in the ’90s, Shulgin's lab was raided and he was asked to turn over his Schedule I drug research license, reports the Times. It's Shulgin's early work on MDMA, though, that's garnered the most attention over the years, even if his method for synthesis now lies in the background of bodies of other work. As the Times notes, Shulgin's endorsement of psychedelics as medical treatments may be slowly moving toward vindication as ecstasy research becomes possible again.

One of its curators announced today that tests on a book titled Des destinées de l’ame (Destinies of The Soul), which was published sometime in the 1880s, have confirmed with 99.9 percent confidence that it's been bound in human skin. The book has been sitting in Harvard's Houghton Library since the 1930s and has had a note inside it from the donor, who explains that he had the book bound in human skin. In French, translated by Harvard, he wrote:  ""This book is bound in human skin parchment on which no ornament has been stamped to preserve its elegance. By looking carefully you easily distinguish the pores of the skin. A book about the human soul deserved to have a human covering: I had kept this piece of human skin taken from the back of a woman. It is interesting to see the different aspects that change this skin according to the method of preparation to which it is subjected. Compare for example with the small volume I have in my library, Sever. Pinaeus de Virginitatis notis which is also bound in human skin but tanned with sumac."" The practice of binding books in human skin wasn't actually all that uncommon in the past and dates back to at least the 15th century, according to Harvard's curators. Known as anthropodermic bibliopegy, people apparently used to have it done to memorialize the dead, among other reasons. The owner of Des destinées de l’ame is said to have gotten the skin from the back of a female mental patient whose body was unclaimed after dying from a stroke. The other book he mentions, Séverin Pineau’s De integritatis & corruptionis virginum notis, is in the Wellcome Library's collection.  ""[It's] very unlikely that the source could be other than human."" Harvard has known about the supposed origin of the book's binding long before today, but it's only now confirming it. To investigate the binding's origin, Harvard researchers analyzed peptides within a sample of it to identify proteins. That allowed them to rule out just about everything but certain primates. Samples were then analyzed further to see how the peptides were constructed, and that allowed the researchers to rule out pretty much everything but a human origin for the binding. ""The analytical data, taken together with the provenance of Des destinées de l’ame, make it very unlikely that the source could be other than human,"" Bill Lane, director of the university's Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Resource Laboratory, tells Harvard's library.

Less motivation to evacuate for ""Hurricane Victoria"" ""Our experiments suggest that a storm with a feminine name is seen as less threatening and risky than one with a more masculine name,"" said Sharon Shavitt, a marketing researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in an email to The Verge. Her study, published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows that people are less motivated to evacuate when a serious storm is named ""Victoria""  than when the same storm is named ""Victor."" To assess the effect of a storm's ""gender"" on its death toll, Shavitt and her team used data from the past six decades. Because the World Meteorological Society selects hurricane appellations from six pre-established lists of alphabetically sorted names with alternating genders, the naming system is free of gender bias. But to make sure the analysis wouldn't be tainted by outliers, the researchers excluded two particularly lethal hurricanes from the analysis: 2005's Hurricane Katrina and 1957's Hurricane Audrey. The researchers found that although there was no difference between fatalities caused by small hurricanes with male names compared to those with female names, there was a substantial difference when the storms grew in intensity. On average, the researchers write in the study, a severe hurricane with a masculine name causes 15 deaths, whereas a strong hurricane with a feminine name causes 42 deaths. deadly gender stereotypes But the researchers also needed to verify people's threat perception, so they asked a group of 346 participants to imagine being in a certain hurricane's path. As expected, participants thought that hurricanes with names like Arthur would be more intense than those named Bertha or Dolly — all names from the official 2014 Atlantic Hurricane list. And a second experiment, in which the researchers compared participants' perception of Hurricane Alexander with their perception of Hurricane Alexandra, confirmed that participants think storms with male names are more dangerous. ""These kinds of implicit biases routinely affect the way actual men and women are judged in society,"" Shavitt said, ""but now it appears that these gender stereotypes can have deadly consequences."" Hurricanes kill more than 200 people in the US each year, so Shavitt hopes this study will make people less likely to judge the riskiness of future storms based on the gendered meanings of their names. But regardless of the study's impact, it might still make sense to ""move away from human names,"" she said. The problem with that idea, however, is that any naming system can be tainted by cultural or gender biases. If you decide to name three storms ""delta,"" ""lion,"" and ""begonia,"" Hurricane Lion is probably going to get more people to move out of its way. That's why labels should be pre-tested beforehand, Shavitt said, if only ""to make sure the meanings associated with them are appropriate."" Update June 2nd, 4:35PM: As Ed Yong points out, there is one factor that might temper the effect found by the researchers: hurricanes all had female names before 1979. It's therefore possible that an imbalance in the data could have caused the researchers to conclude that female hurricanes are significantly deadlier than male hurricanes. This is especially important because hurricanes kill less people now than they did 60 years ago.",0.5673763615204346,0.4326236384795654,0.850632896935771,611,5.2585924713584289,341,6.0821114369501466,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A study published today in PLOS ONE demonstrates that if you put fruit flies in a jar containing food laced with Truvia, they'll die in about 6 days. If you do the same with food containing other sweeteners, however, they'll live for about 45 days. But before you start throwing all your stevia away, consider this: the ingredient that kills flies isn't the stevia extract itself, but erythritol — Truvia's main component, and a sugar alcohol that's harmless to humans. So this newly-discovered property is a good thing, because it means that the world might have a novel, human-safe insecticide on its hands. discovered by a sixth-grader This information comes to us thanks to Simon Kashock-Marenda, a ninth-grader from Philadelphia who was actually in the sixth-grade at the time of the discovery. He realized that Truvia could kill fruit flies while looking into the effect of various sweeteners on insect health and longevity for a science fair experiment. His parents had recently cut back on white sugar, so he was curious about the health effects of substitutes. But when Kaschock-Marenda realized that Truvia was actually killing his flies, he knew something was up. So, he told his father, Daniel Marenda, who also happens to be a biologist at Drexel University. The two are now co-authors of the study. It also impairs fly motor function According to the experiment's results — it was recreated more rigorously in a Drexel lab once the sixth-grader reported the finding — erythritol is toxic to fruit flies in a dose-dependent manner, meaning that a higher dose is more effective. Truvia also appears to impair fly motor function shortly before they die, the researchers report. No other sweetener tested in the study had these effects, including another popular stevia brand called PureVia. And the flies actually love the stuff. When they were given the option to eat either sugar or Truvia, they seemed to prefer the latter. Given these results, it should come as no surprise that the scientists are now trying to patent erythritol as an insecticide. But in the meantime, they hope to find out if it's capable of killing other types of insects, and what mechanism makes it so toxic. Another question they would like to answer is whether insects that consume fruit flies, such as the praying mantis, might also be affected by the sugar alcohol after eating Truvia-fed flies. Erythritol is actually naturally present in a number of fruits, in very small amounts, so the finding hints that it might serve a deeper purpose than sweetening our food. In any case, erythritol probably isn't going to be sprayed on crops, or on campers' bodies any time soon, especially since flies seem to be attracted to it.

The ruling was controversial and some scientists objected to the sentence reduction. ""MAOA findings have been generally used in murder trials, sometimes to suggest diminished capacity of the defendant to premeditate his criminal behavior,"" but most often to reduce a sentence, writes Paul Appelbaum, a psychiatrist at Columbia University, in an essay published today in Neuron. In the essay, Appelbaum explains that genetic evidence demonstrating a defendant's predisposition for antisocial behavior or mental illness is showing up in courtrooms at an ever-quickening pace. And that pace, he warns, might be outrunning the legal system's ability to interpret it. misinterpreted by judges and jurors ""Premature introduction of genetic evidence in court carries a number of risks,"" said Appelbaum in an email to The Verge. ""The most obvious is that the purported associations [between genetics and behavior] are not real and will be disproved over time."" But even the most replicated and widely accepted findings, he said, can be misinterpreted by judges and jurors. In the case of the Italian court, the gene that was used has indeed been associated with impulsiveness and criminal behavior among men in a number of studies. Moreover, childhood maltreatment has been linked to lower MAOA activity — providing a great example of how a genetic predisposition can be triggered by environmental factors. Most experts agree, however, that even evidence as strong as that surrounding MAOA shouldn't be used to absolve someone of responsibility for their actions. ""The major mistake the people make is to think that if you've identified a cause, it must mean that people are excused or mitigated,"" says Stephen Morse, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania who has written on the subject. But that isn't how the law works. Only a limited number of impairments — such as failing to appreciate the wrongfulness of one's acts — are considered exculpatory. So ""if someone is a rational agent,"" Morse says, ""I don't care if they have bad genetics."" It ""doesn't necessarily mean a lessened responsibility."" Jorim Tielbeek, a neuroscientist and criminologist at VU Medical Center Amsterdam who has studied the effects of genetics on antisocial behavior, agrees with Morse, stating in an email to The Verge that a ""higher genetic liability towards committing a crime doesn't necessarily mean a lessened responsibility."" Although scientists have made links between certain genes and antisocial behavior, Tielbeek says, there is ""no clear predictive relationship between a single gene and a criminal act — especially since hundreds of genes are involved in criminal behavior, and that each have a very small effect."" Yet that doesn't mean that either Tielbeek and Morse disagree with using genetics in the courtroom. ""In the future, it may inform a judge of the type of justice interventions that is most suitable for the defendant,"" Tielbeek says. Morse also thinks genetic evidence can be valuable, but he clarifies that ""it should only be used where the behavioral information is unclear."" But what exactly might genetic information help clarify? Deborah Denno, a law professor at Fordham University in New York City whose work was cited in Appelbaum's essay, says that genetics may be especially valuable when trying to figure out what distinguishes one person who grew up in an underprivileged neighborhood from their neighbor — or even their sibling. ""There have been cases where a judge has said, ‘Well your brother and sister didn't commit a crime and they grew up on the same household,'"" Denno says, ""but genetics might explain that difference, because even brothers and sisters don't have the exact same genes."" a win for those who want a legal system free of bias That's why some legal scholars think the introduction of genetic evidence in criminal cases is a huge win for those who want a legal system free of bias. As Denno puts it, it's a lot harder to argue with a defendant's traumatic family history when you have genetic evidence backing it up. ""Genetics cuts through biases,"" she says, ""so judges are not going to be bringing in their own personal garbage into a case."" And despite a handful of controversial examples, the use of genetic evidence doesn't appear to be making that big of an impact on the world's legal proceedings — at least not yet. One study that looked into the effect of genetics on the sentencing of psychopaths found that the average criminal case sentence is 13 years when genetic evidence is introduced. When it isn't, most defendants get 14 years. ""It's no different than anything that is already being used to reduce sentences,"" says Kevin Beaver, a criminologist at Florida State University who has studied how people who are predisposed to antisocial behavior — people whose parents have been arrested, for instance — are more at risk for being processed through the criminal justice system than the general population. ""So if we believe in mitigating factors, such as peer influence or abuse by parents, then I think those biological explanations would fall directly in line with those. I don't really see it as significant."" when a child's bloody t-shirt carries more weight Appelbaum himself has looked into the impact of genetic evidence in homicide cases. In a 2014 study involving 250 survey participants, he found that people are disinclined to accept claims of diminished responsibility or pleas for reduced sentences based on genetic claims when that evidence is presented uncritically. ""You can introduce all the genetics evidence you want in court, but in a case where a child was beaten to death by their parents, what do you think will have more weight?"" asks Denno, ""The fact that a parent has a history of violence going back four generations, or the moment when the prosecution shows the child's bloody T-shirt?"" Interestingly, some experts argue that we already use manifestations of our genetic makeup to reduce a person's prison sentence — it just isn't conceptualized that way. ""Criminal defendants have long pleaded for mercy on the basis of problematic family histories,"" said Appelbaum, ""such as substance abuse or criminality that may have genetic foundations, or because of experiences like child abuse,"" which may impact the way genes are expressed. When observed through that lens, the introduction of genetic evidence doesn't appear all that novel. lawyers will have to wait for the evidence to pile up That may be why experts are more worried about misuse of genetic evidence than genetic evidence itself. ""As genetics becomes a more frequent visitor to the courtroom ... the risk that genetic information will be misinterpreted will be real,"" Appelbaum writes in the essay. But regardless of the fear that this information might be badly employed, science marches onward, so the answer to this dilemma might simply be that legal professionals need to learn to wait for evidence to pile up before making use of new genetic findings. Of course, determining when a study has been replicated ""enough"" won't be easy. But the waiting part — where we ignore evidence that doesn't seem all that relevant — is something we already know how to do. After all, Morse jokes, society has known the identity of the number one predisposing risk factor for violent crime for far longer than it has known about the double-helix, and that hasn't stopped anyone from ignoring it in a court of law. ""The number one risk factor for violent crime is the Y chromosome,"" Morse says. If we allowed ""maleness"" to be used as an excusing condition, he says, ""most violent criminals would be getting off.""",0.49683428555601417,0.5031657144439858,0.8315798849736685,1298,5.1317411402157163,596,6.4614093959731544,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In order to help reach that mass audience, the company has hired former Barnes & Noble chief executive William Lynch as its new CEO. Lynch led the bookseller's transition to digital under the Nook brand until his resignation last July. Founder of Savant, Robert Madonna, tells The Verge in an interview that Lynch's experience with Nook was partly behind the decision to bring him on board. Currently, Savant's impressive smart home products are sold through dealers for $5,000 to over $10,000, and they must be custom-installed. The systems use a base station computer and allow you to use a smartphone or tablet to control everything from your blinds, lights, and thermostat to what's playing on your TV and stereo.   Madonna, who's been the CEO since the company's inception, explained that while his focus has been on the luxury market, he ""always expected the mid-level market to take off and now ... it’s time to bring in additional talent that can take the company to the next step."" He added that ""William [Lynch] will be helping definitely with his leadership, steering the ship through taking it into the mid-level market and beyond."" ""We’ll be investigating the do-it-yourself market."" Lynch tells The Verge that he has experience in ""taking sophisticated technology products and consumerizing them,"" referring to both engineering and design as well efforts to ""market them to consumers in a way they can grasp easily."" He'll likely need to work hard to make Savant's future products understandable to regular consumers. The first such product is set to be released this spring, and it reaches down to just about $1,000, thanks in part to relying on a Linux-powered base station instead of the Mac Mini used in its higher-end systems. The new system, which doesn't yet have a name, will still require professional installation. As for the future, neither the founder nor Lynch would make any specific comments, but Madonna did say that ""we’ll be investigating the do-it-yourself market.""

The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has been investigating the issue for six months, but today the agency begins a two-day hearing of testimony from experts ranging from lawyers and entrepreneurs to the Winklevoss twins, who are heavily invested in Bitcoin and Bitcoin startups. The agency appears to be on track to introduce a special license for virtual currencies sometime this year. ""It's our expectation that the information we’ve gathered in this fact-finding effort will allow us to put forward, during the course of 2014, a proposed regulatory framework for virtual currency firms operating in New York,"" Benjamin M. Lawsky, the state's superintendent of financial services, said in a statement. ""I believe we would be the first state in the nation to do so. Clearly, when it comes to virtual currencies, regulators are in new and unchartered waters."" ""Regulators are in new and unchartered waters."" Yesterday's arrest of a prominent Bitcoin entrepreneur, Charlie Shrem of the payments facilitator BitInstant, underscores the need for regulatory clarity on virtual currencies. Many Bitcoin businesses, including exchanges and wallets, hold a customer's money in Bitcoin with the promise of giving it back to them at a later date. That means they resemble money transmitters, companies that provide financial services while stopping short of acting like a full bank. Every state has its own rules for money transmitters, requiring different levels of record-keeping and due diligence on clients. The latter is known as the ""know your customer"" standard and is designed to prevent the kind of money laundering that prosecutors claim Shrem participated in. Shrem allegedly sold bitcoins to a client who then resold them to users of Silk Road, the marketplace where illegal drugs were sold. According to money-transmitter laws in most states, Shrem should not have participated in that sale and should have reported his client for suspicious activity. States are finding that it's not so easy to shoehorn Bitcoin companies into the law The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN), the federal body that regulates money transmitters, has said that Bitcoin businesses should register with the federal government using the same paperwork as PayPal, Western Union, and other transmitters. But New York and other states are finding that it's not so easy to shoehorn virtual currency transmitters into the existing law. ""They’ve realized that there are just some areas where it's not going to be an easy fit,"" says Judith Rinearson, a partner at Bryan Cave who specializes in money transmission and virtual currencies, and will testify at the hearing. It  makes sense to craft a custom rule for Bitcoin, she says. ""Something that works and makes consumers feel secure and comfortable, but at the same time not so much regulation that you're going to restrict or kill the industry or push the industry offshore.""",0.5203055595867032,0.4796944404132968,0.8679935225367613,507,5.331360946745562,294,6.3945578231292517,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The Wall Street Journal reports the DOJ warned Sprint that an acquisition could meet with ""intense scrutiny"" and regulatory difficulties. Although the WSJ's sources disagree on the level of resistance conveyed in the meeting, some say that the current four-carrier system is regarded as important to maintaining a competitive market in the US. There's nothing particularly unusual about the meeting itself — such conversations are commonplace before an acquisition bid — but the DOJ doesn't usually give too strong an opinion on a deal until they've fully reviewed a case. Regardless of the strength of the DOJ's concern, it appears it's not going to dissuade Sprint chairman Masayoshi Son from pursuing a deal. Masayoshi Son, who obtained a majority stake in Sprint last year, has been rumored to be planning to merge the company with T-Mobile for several months, with December reports suggesting a deal was getting closer. According to the WSJ, Sprint has the financing in place to launch a bid, and the two are currently working out terms such as a breakup fees, leadership structure, and what the newly merged company would be called. Given the complexity of the negotiations, they could take some time to resolve.  The companies would need to demonstrate that a deal would increase competition T-Mobile was very nearly bought by AT&T back in 2011, but the deal fell apart, mainly due to intense scrutiny from antitrust officials at the DOJ and FCC. Although Sprint and T-Mobile are third and forth place behind market leaders AT&T and Verizon, the companies would need to demonstrate that a deal would increase competition. While a newly formed Sprint-T-Mobile would undoubtably be better placed to compete with Verizon and AT&T in raw numbers, it's not quite as simple, as we explained last month. After a torrid few years, T-Mobile has begun to turn things around recently, and Sprint has Masayoshi Son's financial clout to help it on a similar path to recovery. With that in mind, it could be argued that both companies are already in a good place to be competitive with AT&T and Verizon moving forward.",0.7213047499057649,0.2786952500942351,0.573940210323174,387,5.036175710594315,229,6.0087336244541483,0,0,"Business, Mobile, Tech",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The tragic event immediately took on controversial overtones when Muzzafar told police at the scene he was working for Uber, the transportation startup. Uber initially released a statement saying the crash ""did not involve a vehicle or provider doing a trip on the Uber system."" Later it updated that statement to clarify that ""the driver in question was a partner of Uber ... the driver was not providing services on the Uber system during the time of the accident."" It’s fuzzy language, but it boils down to this: Uber wants to operate in the real world with the relative freedom and impunity most online startups enjoy — but without the regulations placed on most taxi services. Uber has said on many occasions that it's a technology company, not a transportation provider. It wants to be neutral, much as YouTube doesn’t bear responsibility for its users' videos and Craigslist doesn’t verify items for sale. Uber’s position is that it’s not responsible for anything a driver does before a ride is booked and after a fare is paid.

Chris Dolan, a San Francisco lawyer, is challenging that approach. Yesterday, he filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Uber seeking damages on the behalf of the Liu family. Dolan argues that because Muzafar was logged in to the Uber app — meaning he appeared as a driver to anyone looking for a ride and could see customers requesting pickups — that he was indeed actively working for Uber and that the company should be liable for damages caused by the accident. ""Uber is hanging these drivers out to dry,"" says Dolan. ""And in doing so, they are endangering the public."" ""Uber is hanging these drivers out to dry."" Uber declined to comment for this story, but the letter of the law might be on the startup's side for now. In September of 2013 California became the first state to issue regulations on ride-sharing services like Lyft, Sidecar, and UberX. The California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) created the category of Transportation Network Company (TNC) to ""apply to companies that provide prearranged transportation services for compensation using an online-enabled application (app) or platform to connect passengers with drivers using their personal vehicles."" Muzzafar was an UberX driver and not part of the Uber Black program. The difference is that UberX drivers are contractors rather than employees of Uber. And while Uber has commercial insurance that covers black car drivers the entire time they are on the road, it only covers UberX drivers actively working a fare. That squares with the California Public Utility Commission regulations, which state that ride-sharing companies must have commercial insurance to cover ""vehicles and drivers in transit to or during a TNC trip."" In a testy exchange with The New York Times, Uber's CEO said, ""We work our butts off to go above and beyond what is expected even by the regulators, including insurance, background checks. And so it always comes back to, did Uber do something wrong?"" A lawyer who makes a living suing over injuries Dolan argues in his lawsuit that whether or not the UberX driver has a fare, if they are logged into the app they are creating an economic benefit for Uber and so should be covered by the company. ""When a customer opens up the app, Uber wants them to see lots of available rides. Those are drivers logged in to the app who aren’t actively working a fare."" As a lawyer who makes his living off personal injury claims, of course, Dolan has a self-interested position in arguing that companies like Uber, which has raised hundreds of millions in funding, a liable for all accidents on its network. The lawsuit also contends that UberX drivers logged in but not actively working a fare are likely to be far more impaired drivers than those with passengers. ""These guys are checking their phones to see where the customers are,"" says Dolan. ""If the symphony lets out and requests start coming in, they need to check their GPS and be quick to accept a fare."" According to Muzzafar and his lawyer, on the night of the accident he was actively working for UberX and had already serviced one fare prior to the crash. ""He was working for Uber,"" his lawyer, Graham Archer, told the Boston Globe. ""He was waiting for a fare."" He was simply between customers when the tragedy occurred. The CPUC wouldn’t comment specifically on this case, pointing instead to its language on insurance requirements. Spokesman Andrew Koch did note that the new rules are not set in stone. ""Our proceeding has a phase two. Going forward we will ensure that the overarching goals of public safety, equity, and innovation are being achieved. We will have a public process in the next year to consider the performance of this new mode of transportation and accompanying regulations."" Who's responsible for the gray area in between fares? Dolan believes that the laws will have to change in order to close the loophole of UberX drivers who are on the road looking for business but don’t have a fare. ""There is a wide gulf between the $15,000 in personal liability insurance a driver must carry and the million dollar commercial policy required for ride-sharing vehicles,"" he points out. If this case proceeds, it will likely play a role in shaping what are still new and relatively untested laws, and whether or not Uber can maintain the same kind of limited liability that tech startups enjoy online. ""Transportation has evolved from horse and buggy to cable cars to personal autos to ride-sharing services,"" says Dolan. ""The law has to evolve alongside it to maintain the same level of accountability.""",0.39781734737332386,0.6021826526266761,0.8770454188430543,1028,4.9396887159533076,511,6.1037181996086103,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

According to the Associated Press, the largest flight attendant's union in the US — the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA — is suing the FAA in hopes of having its new rules overturned. The union argues that use of small electronics is a danger because they can become projectiles during turbulence and because they may cause passengers to pay less attention during safety announcements.  Airlines still have the ultimate choice The union alleges that the administration failed to properly provide public notice and receive comments on the rule change. The administration did request and receive public feedback before making the change, however the union argues that it was not through the correct procedure. Ultimately, the rule change still leaves the choice up to airlines on whether or not use of electronics should be allowed. After the ban was lifted last year, airlines quickly began allowing passengers to use electronics.

FBI Director James Comey is on quite a media blitz. In the month since the iPhone 6 launch, he's appeared on television and radio over and over again, talking up the supposed dangers of Apple's new encryption standards. After a televised press conference in September, he's appeared in countless articles criticizing Apple's new measures, which would automatically encrypt data held on the iPhone, and prevent Apple from decrypting it for law enforcement. Last night, Comey showed up on 60 Minutes to do it again. It's enough for the AFP to dub it Crypto Wars 2.0, a rehash of the struggle for legal cryptography that played out in the ’90s. FBI Director Comey never does more than talk One important thing to notice: Comey never does more than talk. The battles over encryption in the ’90s played out with arrests and court battles. Anyone offering end-to-end encryption, which doesn't let carriers hold the decryption keys, was under real legal threat. In the most alarming example, Phil Zimmermann spent years battling federal arms exporting charges over his PGP encryption suite. The threat of force was real, and resisting it took real sacrifice. Director Comey, on the other hand, hasn't offered anything more than vague concerns. If he's serious about the dangers of encryption, there's plenty Comey could do — whether in court cases or in Congress itself — but without some real proposal, he's just rehashing decades-old arguments about warrants and software freedom. After three weeks of talk, it's time for Comey to put up or shut up. The most obvious route is to take Apple to court. If the FBI serves Apple a warrant for data on a suspected murderer's iPhone and Apple doesn't comply (according to Tim Cook, they can't), then the FBI can hold them in contempt of court until they change their system. It wouldn't be the first time the FBI jumped into a long legal battle on a point of principle, and the Department of Justice has plenty of lawyers who would love to try that case. It will be messy and public, but that's a small price to pay for rescuing kidnapping victims, right? If encryption is a problem, why not take Apple to court? If Comey's worried the law itself isn't on his side, he can push to have the law changed. There's a bill called CALEA II that would mandate exactly the kind of backdoor Comey wants. It's been kicking around Congress for years, with no shortage of sponsors. Why not get on national television and call for Congress to push it through, just to show you're serious? Congress is bad, but they can still pass a few laws when there's enough heat on, and they like James Comey a whole lot more than Tim Cook. But in both cases, Comey's holding back because he knows he'd probably lose. Every time CALEA II comes up for a vote, privacy groups sound the alarm — and with surveillance fears at an all-time high, that tactic is only getting more effective. If Comey publicly backed CALEA II, it would only raise the alarms early, spooking whatever congressional support the bill already has. And if the FBI pressed the current law against a company as powerful as Apple, there's plenty of reason to think Apple would come away clean, thanks in part to the precedents set by the last crypto wars. The FBI can bully small companies like Lavabit over encryption, but the law is still on the side of the coders. So Comey's left exactly where we started, making ominous noises and generating headlines favorable to the FBI, but not actually doing anything. It's a bluff, a way to nudge public opinion without committing the bureau to anything. This isn't a crypto war — it's a pageant.",0.4898560194086381,0.5101439805913619,0.8602179718583582,650,4.7523076923076921,367,5.6866485013623977,0,0,"US & World, Editorial, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

While it is very easy to focus on militarization after seeing jarring pictures of police pointing semi-automatic rifles at demonstrators, a separate but no less questionable practice has been quietly taking root at some of America's biggest police departments in the past decade. As ProPublica reports, the police departments of New York City, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Oakland have all turned to private police foundations in recent years to acquire new crime fighting and law enforcement gear — everything from horses for mounted police units to spy software developed by intelligence contractor Palantir (a grateful LAPD appeared in the following 2013 advertisement for Palantir's crime investigation platform, which knits together data from a variety of sources, from police reports to license plate readers).   These police foundations are considered charities, and the equipment they buy for police departments is typically given as ""gifts"" or ""donations."" The his process allows police departments to get their hands on controversial new equipment without having to spend money from their budgets — which have been slashed in the wake of the 2009 recession — and without getting approval from public authorities such as city council members, according to ProPublica. In a further note of concern, large corporations including Palantir and Motorola have donated to police foundations that later purchased their technology. While company spokespersons said the practices were sound, ProPublica's diligent investigation reveals that, at the very least, more public oversight of the relationship between police foundations and departments would be helpful in keeping track of what exactly the police have at their disposal and how it got there. Correction: this story has been updated to clarify that the rifles cited in the Ferguson protests were ""semi-automatic"" not ""automatic"" as previously stated.

Among the myriad challenges that arise in these dense, impoverished urban areas, getting mail may seem to be a surprising one. Yet due to the unique, improvised architecture of favelas — the fact that structures are often created and destroyed rapidly, using a variety of available materials, such as concrete, that are impenetrable to mapping satellites — many buildings don't have addresses. Further complicating matters is the fact that many streets are called different names by residents in different areas. As a consequence, postal workers haven't been required to deliver mail in these areas, frustrating residents. Many areas only appear on Google Maps and other digital maps in extremely limited forms, as a single road, for example (controversially, Google also removed the word ""favela"" from some of its maps at urging from the Brazilian government).  But a group of enterprising friends recently decided to tackle the problem starting in Brazil's largest favela, Rocinha, using good old pen and paper. As Vice Motherboard explains in an article reported from Rocinha, a former bodysurfer turned census worker named Carlos Pedro, together with two of his fellow workers, launched a new private subscription mail delivery service called Friendly Mailman. The startup company was born after Pedro and his cofounders laboriously walked the streets of Rocinha and cataloged the structures that they passed in a paper notebook, using their own custom analog algorithm to assign addresses and differentiate between types of buildings. Their mail service has taken off, expanding to eight favelas in the Rio de Janeiro area. It accepts mail directly from the post office and then distributes it to participating households at a cost of $6.64 USD per month. While hardly the first effort to map Brazil's sprawing favelas — a United Nations effort back used camera-equipped kites, while another nonprofit tried GPS-equipped mobile phones; Google and Microsoft are still making progress using their own mapping systems — Friendly Mailman provides the additional service of physical mail and package delivery. On the downside, the maps are proprietary and even if opened to the public, would be difficult for a layperson to use without training.

The manufacturer of those guardrails, Trinity Highway Products, is heading to court this week facing allegations that it changed its guardrail design without informing the Federal Highway Administration and has been improperly accepting federal money ever since, according to The New York Times. Separate lawsuits reportedly allege that those changes have led to five deaths and many other injuries in at least 14 accidents across the US.  Federal agencies reportedly didn't know of the change for seven years When the end terminal of a guardrail is hit, it's supposed to divert the rail away from the oncoming vehicle while also absorbing the crash's impact. But in some instances, the end of the guardrail fails to do this, instead allowing the rail to pierce the striking vehicle — and potentially anyone inside. This has allegedly started happening because of a seemingly minor cost-saving change by Trinity: shrinking the width of the guardrail's feeding channel from five inches to four. Though Trinity is said to have conducted and passed tests for this new design, it apparently did not alert or receive approval for the change when it was made back in 2005. Federal agencies were reportedly not made aware of it until 2012. The video above demonstrates use of the ET-2000 terminal, which is the predecessor to the altered model, the ET-Plus. Trinity is now facing a false claims lawsuit saying that it improperly took federal funds for this new guardrail, which was not specifically approved. The suit was filed by Joshua Harman on behalf of the US government. The Times reports that Harman partially owns two companies that manufacture and install guardrails and was sued by Trinity for patent infringement back in 2011. Bloomberg reports that Harman could earn as much as a third of any judgement against Trinity, which has up to $1 billion at stake. Despite the serious claims, it's unclear if Harman will be able to back them up. Trinity tells Bloomberg that the allegations are ""false and misleading,"" and the Federal Highway Administration still allows states to receive federal reimbursement for them, having not found enough evidence that they're a problem. However, several states are opposed to the new rails. The Times reports that Missouri, Nevada, and Massachusetts have all banned further installation of these new guardrail terminals, expressing concerns over their safety. Tens of thousands of the terminals have reportedly been installed nationwide. Trinity did not respond to a request for comment. This is the second time Harman's case has gone to trial.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced the new screening measures on Wednesday after Thomas Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the US, died from the disease. The decision comes in response to growing fears in the US public that Ebola could easily spread into the country via international air travel. Duncan's diagnosis in Dallas on September 30th after arrival from West Africa amplified those fears. As part of the new protocol, travelers arriving from Liberia, Guinea, or Sierra Leone — the three nations at the epicenter of the outbreak — will be directed to a specified area for screening, according to the CDC. The travelers will be identified by stamps in their passports from the three affected countries. Staff will then monitor arrivals for signs of the disease, take their temperatures, and ask a number of questions to determine whether someone was likely in contact with Ebola. Those at risk will then be passed over to local health authorities for closer monitoring and possible isolation. Travelers who clear the process will be given a information sheet detailing the symptoms of Ebola. Enhanced screenings will begin at four other US airports next week Other than JFK, the same screening process will be put in place at Newark, Washington Dulles, Chicago O’Hare, and Atlanta international airports starting next week.

The shlocky concept was named 94110 after the neighborhood's zip code, and was roundly ridiculed online. Nonetheless, nearly 100 hopefuls showed up for the casting call this weekend, which was held at SFAQ, a dinged-up, lived-in little art gallery in the Tenderloin. For much of the afternoon on Saturday and Sunday, they sat on folding chairs in the gallery, waiting for a chance to screen test for roles such as the socially awkward engineer (""likes punk rock, addicted to vaping""), the wantrepreneur who relies on ""alcohol-fueled bro-downs for brainstorming sessions,"" and the venture capitalist ""with lots of likes and followers,"" who ""puts out good vibes and gets good returns."" The creators of 94110 have been tight-lipped about their plans, so if I wanted to find out more, my only choice was to try out. I auditioned for the venture capitalist role, briefly toying with the idea of performing under the alias Ellen Pao. On my way to the gallery, I got an iMessage out of the blue from Scott Vermeire, the show’s director of marketing and communications, who introduced himself only as ""Scott from 94110."" We agreed to meet at the auditions where he turned out to be a dead ringer for Sal from Mad Men. ""Name a new media or technological tool . . . and it probably came out of that area code."" ""94110 is probably the hottest zip code in America right now,"" Vermeire insisted, leaning against the building as we stood on the sidewalk outside. ""Name a new media or technological tool that's of any import in the last couple years and it probably came out of that area code."" Vermeire is vastly overstating 94110's importance to the world of tech. I should know — I live in the zip code. Before I saw the flier, I'd never heard anyone invoke those five digits as a status symbol. But Vermeire has a vested interest in a vision of San Francisco where the brightest minds in tech work hard — and play harder — all while sharing the same aspirational address. In truth, the Mission has become as synonymous with Bay Area class tension as Google’s shuttle buses, which roll through the neighborhood at regular intervals. Walk by at the right hour, and you can watch tech workers sheepishly shuffle onboard. The influx of hipster bars to entertain these workers and garish condos to house them is rapidly displacing working class residents and a deeply-established Latino community that goes back generations. I should know, I'm gentrifying the Mission myself. In the midst of upheaval and evictions, 94110 conjured fears that it would come across as glibly as The Real World: Gentrification or Survivor: Rise of the Hacker Hostel. (The panic was exacerbated by pink fliers that recently surfaced advertising ""a docu-series for a major American broadcaster"" about the real girlfriends of Silicon Valley.) Vermeire, however, assured me that 94110 would be a sophisticated fictional take, combining ""adult drama, tech, and San Francisco."" Casting call for ""94110"" a TV drama set in the Mission. pic.twitter.com/v1TfSr9e0K  The reason HBO’s Silicon Valley is set in Silicon Valley is because that’s where corporate tech campuses are located. In contrast, the Mission is more where those campus dwellers live and like to go out at night. I’m guessing that's why the producers didn't pick 94103, home to the headquarters of Uber, Twitter, Airbnb, and Pinterest. Or 94107, home to the SOMA tech takeover and popular daytime meeting spots like Small Foods, the Creamery, Caffe Centro, and Darwin Cafe. 94110 is blossoming under all that shade To date, the residents of 94110 (at least the ones who spend their time on social media) have not appreciated the attention, rolling their eyes over the premise. I asked Vermeire how the producers felt about the negative response from the neighbors. ""I feel great,"" he said, without missing a beat. ""I think it's all buzz. I’ve seen buzz at launch like this, I've never seen it this early in development."" In other words, the iffy idea, which still doesn’t have a distribution deal and seems to be operating on a very limited budget, is blossoming under all that shade. The creators have yet to reveal their identities, perhaps to stave off those haters or more likely because they have nothing in the way of name recognition. ""There's a handful of things I’m not at liberty to say and that's one of them,"" was all Vermeire would offer. He did, however, spill some new info about distribution. ""We've gotten really excited about the idea of partnering with a Silicon Valley blog or a Silicon Valley media outlet . . . maybe like The Verge."" You will not be viewing 94110 on TheVerge.com, but Vermeire emphasized that they’re down for whatever. ""We've gone at this project with an open-doorway mind — an open-kimono mind — and so far that's only brought us good fortune."" ""We've gone at this project with an open-doorway mind."" One clue about the show’s worldview is at the top of the screen test guidelines, where it states there will be no casting preference toward age, race, or gender. ""Only requirements are that you're over 18, non-Union, and live in the Bay Area. We're not flying anyone in for this,"" Vermeire told me. That’s savvy marketing. But reflecting the diversity of the Mission isn’t about who gets cast as a tech executive, it’s the fact that all these homies livin’ and lovin’ in 94110 work in tech. That’s not what you see if you walk down Mission Street. Some of the roles are also less open to interpretation, like the lead described as: ""B R O in lifestyle and mindset."" In an even shrewder bit of propaganda, the producers have framed their focus on techies as an unwillingness to pander to their critics. A producer who wouldn’t give his last name told Mission Local: ""This is not social realism, we don’t want to to talk down to anyone, there’s not going to be any condescending populistic messages in it (the show)."" 94110 seems to think it can stop being polite and start getting real. To that end, the character sketches were fairly finely drawn, even though the cast sounds like the makings of the most annoying Burning Man camp ever. The monologues accurately reflect the kind of ambition, anxiety, competitiveness, and utterly meaningless startup jargon that pervades San Francisco’s tech scene. The most unrealistic archetype was a supporting character who works for a number of on-demand apps and tries to rationalize making only $12/hour. The script for that role said: ""Of course, I fucking love the freedom of the 1099 economy."" The spate of class action lawsuits against Uber, Handy, and Postmates offer a different perspective on the labor side of the sharing economy. Pretending to be an asshole is empowering Even after seeing the turnout for auditions and lights and cameras that greeted them, I still think it's possible that 94110 is a piece of performance art that got out of hand. Vermeire seemed to present himself as a bit of a techie, but his personal website says he's an artist from Oakland. I asked him to name some film projects the production company had been involved in, but Vermeire only mentioned his own stint at a group called Thunderball Media that was developing apps for Google Glass. ""Of course Google wimped out, bailed on Google Glass, we lost our business model, game over,"" he said. ""That's where [the show] hit home with me. I've seen success, I've seen quite a bit of success, but I've also seen failure."" Failure had come up in my audition as well. When my name was called, I walked into a tiny white room with two men and one woman seated behind a folding table. The instructions warned that the panel ""may ask some interview-style questions."" I expected them to inquire about me, not the fictional investor I was playing, but I found it easier than expected to stay in character. One could say I #crushedit. What work-life balance? With the number of venture capital funds growing, how do you pick a winner, they asked. Pattern-matching, I said. What’s your relationship with failure? Badge of courage, I wear it proudly even if the newcomers don’t. What do you think of the Mission, is it for work or play? There's no work-life balance in the tech industry because we love what we do. What do you do when someone annoys you? Get up and leave. What if you see them out again? Nod politely. It's not personal, it's just business and my time is too valuable to waste. Pretending you're a rich, entitled asshole is very empowering. What's more, fielding questions when you're supposed to sound like an expert helped me ""grok"" the propensity for meaningless business babble. Sometimes you need to say ""pivot"" just to buy yourself time to think. Before I exited, they zoomed in close and asked me to read the VC monologue again: Vermeire told me that the producers wanted to ""cast from a native geography"" within the zip code, which is why they put up fliers targeting ""micro-hoods"" like The Quad and Mission Gulch. ""That was absolutely intentional. We didn’t hire some flier-ing service who accidentally put all those fliers in the Mission,"" Vermeire said with a laugh. Last year, SFist wrote about the invention of The Quad as a microhood and the realtor who named it. ""It will make you want to rip off your eyelids,"" they wrote, but ""it’s important to note that she’s not entirely off the mark."" @ItsMayho lol. Yeah.

When the first episode of Life is Strange launched in January, it was notable especially because of its setting and characters: it's a game that takes place in a normal small town and stars two teen girls. In a medium saturated with military shooters and sci-fi action games, it was a breath of fresh air. And with its third episode launching today, Life is Strange is shaping up to be gaming's equivalent of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or iZombie; a story that blends the real world and fantasy into something very special.  Life is Strange puts you in the role of Max, a young girl studying to be a photographer at a fancy high school. Her best friend Chloe is a prototypical teen rebel, complete with blue hair and a strict step-dad. Max is basically the opposite: calm, quiet, and warm-hearted, and much more of an observer than most video game leads. Across its first few episodes, Life is Strange touches on typical teenage drama. There are breakups and disputes with the cool kids, and things get pretty dark when guns show up and one student contemplates suicide. The gameplay itself is a lot like games like The Walking Dead; the core of the experience is making choices, often difficult ones, and seeing how things play out. There isn’t a whole lot of action. But there's a twist: Max has the ability to rewind time and essentially get a do-over when she makes a decision. As refreshing as the setting and characters may be, the developers at French studio Dontnod actually started with the time travel mechanic and worked backwards from there, creating a world that suited the gameplay. It was an idea they had toyed with in the studio's previous game, the cyberpunk adventure Remember Me, and they wanted to expand on it. ""We really wanted to explore the mechanics of choices and consequences within a relatable setting, with characters anchored in reality,"" directors Michel Koch and Raoul Barbet explain via email. ""Max was literally created to seamlessly complement the rewind mechanism."" When you first play the game it feels almost like the time traveling will undermine the entire experience. After all, what's the point in making difficult moral choices if you can just go back and try again? But the mechanic doesn't let you see very far into the future, so even though the decisions in Life is Strange aren't as pressing as in The Walking Dead, they're just as challenging, and can be just as devastating: a mistake I made at the end of episode two still makes me wince whenever I think about it. Those more difficult choices aren't the entire experience, but instead are used to punctuate key moments in the game. In fact, a lot of the time Life is Strange is incredibly chill. ""There are also a lot of sequences where the player is free to explore and lose themselves in the world,"" explain Koch and Barbet. ""They can enjoy a sunset, take time to play the guitar, lie down on their bed and experience Max's thoughts, sit on an old swing in a backyard, and have a small trip down memory lane with Max. We can experience this kind of slower scene in a lot of indie games, but not that much in mainstream gaming, and we are very proud of this."" One of the most surprising things about Life is Strange isn't necessarily the game itself, but the fact that it's backed by a major publisher, a group typically averse to weird new games that fall outside the norm. Dontnod partnered with Square Enix to publish the game — the same company behind blockbusters like Final Fantasy and Deus Ex — and according to the two directors, Square was one of the only companies that didn't want to change the game. Some potential publishers requested that Max be changed to a male character, for example, something that’s more in line with typical mainstream games, but goes against much of what Life is Strange is trying to be. ""They were the only publisher who would allow us to make the exact game we wanted to make,"" the pair says of Square Enix. It might seem strange for a bunch of adult French men to make a game about American teen girls, but the creators say that it's because they spent so much time with shows like Buffy and Twin Peaks when they were young. ""We grew up with American pop culture,"" they explain. This disconnect may partly explain the occasionally silly and forced-sounding dialogue — at one point in episode two someone actually says ""preach it sista!"" and Chloe uses the word ""hella"" more than any real person should. As for the setting — Life is Strange takes place in a small town in the Pacific Northwest — that was inspired by a trip to Seattle. ""We just fell in love with the almost mystical feeling of the woods and the Pacific Ocean in this part of the US,"" the directors explain, ""and that's when we knew then that we wanted our story to take place in a small town in this region."" Life is Strange is one of a growing number of games to be released episodically, with short episodes coming out every month or two. We're halfway through the game's debut season, which will span five episodes, and Koch and Barbet say that the release schedule has allowed the studio to tweak the game based on what players think. ""Even though the whole story was already written way before the release of episode one, and each episode already in the making, we were still able to adjust some elements based on player feedback,"" they explain. That includes things like making certain popular characters more prominent, and even creating new scenes to give them additional screen time and dialogue. The new series is drastically different from Remember Me, and its creators say that's by design. While the vast majority of big name video game developers and publishers seem content to create experiences based on a tiny number of genres and settings, Koch and Barbet are looking for variety, to tell the kinds of stories you don't typically find in games. They don't know what the studio’s next game will be yet, but it likely won't be a cyberpunk action game or a time-traveling teen drama. ""It would be a shame to not try hard each time to be different and new."" Episode three of Life is Strange is available today on PC, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.

It’s a problem that, for many, has sunk the experiences of games like BioShock Infinite and Uncharted; they involve heroic characters whose nuanced behavior in cutscenes doesn’t match up to their murderous actions when the player is in control. But last year, one game came as close as I’ve seen to solving this intractable dilemma, and from an unlikely source. Wolfenstein: The New Order is as brutal and intense as any first-person shooter you’ll ever play, and it’s the most recent entry in a classic series whose stock has considerably fallen. But developer MachineGames used smart storytelling devices to build up a truly evil enemy that you feel no guilt at all in taking on — the game is set in an alternate history where the Nazis won — and the results are surprisingly congruous and emotional.  Set in a devastated Europe ruled by Nazis, with burly protagonist BJ Blazkowicz as the free world’s last hope, The New Order handles persecution, sex, and politics with unusual pathos for a violent video game, while still painting the overall picture in broad, colorful strokes. It reminds me of nothing as much as Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds, which adopted a similar schlocky tone to the same dark period of history to great effect. Dwight Schultz’s turn as skeletal antagonist Deathshead may not be quite as unsettling as Hans Landa, but his sadistic malevolence still earns him a place in the pantheon of great video game villains.  Now The New Order has a prequel. It’s called The Old Blood, it’s a $20 “stand-alone expansion,” and it’s even more extreme. The Old Blood differs from The New Order in a few ways. It’s shorter, as you’d expect. It’s pulpier in tone. And, in some aspects, it turns out not to be as interesting. What it does share, however, is the way it plays: tight, old-school first-person action that removes many of the standard elements — regenerating health, for example — that people have come to expect from the genre. ""'The New Order' was definitely a bit of a love letter to old-school shooters."" ""The New Order was definitely a bit of a love letter to old-school shooters,"" says MachineGames producer John Jennings. ""When first approaching a project like Wolfenstein, we had to ask ourselves ‘Why were the original Wolfensteins so good?’ and this forced us to look at some design features that might be regarded as old school these days. Certain design elements of shooters fell by the wayside over the last 10 years, but why restrict players to only two or three weapons? It may be more realistic, but is less choice better?"" But the new Wolfenstein games don’t feel stuck in the past; the simple combat and winding level design instead comes off as a breath of fresh air when married to modern graphics and responsive controls. The Old Blood builds on that formula with the addition of a simple lead pipe. This can be used for anything: the ability to break down fragile walls, jack open uncooperative doors, and scale giddy precipices adds welcome diversity to the environments. It’s also used as a way to quietly take down enemies, which contributes to the game’s excellent balance between stealth and gunplay. Both approaches are equally viable, and unlike a lot of games, if one fails for you it’s easy to switch to the other on the fly. ""We continue to let the player control pacing to a strong degree, as we did in The New Order,"" says Jennings. ""We never fully dictate whether a chapter is a ‘stealth chapter’ or an ‘action chapter’. I think that offering this choice helps with the player immersion; giving them a choice in how a chapter plays out, rather than just being along for the ride."" Another difference with The Old Blood is the lack of cutscenes; the game plays out almost entirely in first-person perspective. ""We wanted the game to feel like you’re immersed in a continuous mission from start to end,"" says Jennings. ""It plays like a series of 24, with every chapter flowing immediately into the next one."" It’s a technique that’s been used well by many games ever since the original Half-Life, but I don’t think it’s a change for the better here. The New Order’s cutscenes were effective and served as a breather; with less focus on storytelling and little to break up the relentless action, The Old Blood can sometimes feel like a slog. MachineGames was founded by former members of Swedish studio Starbreeze, which has shown a flair for meaningful character-based interaction in first-person shooters. The Darkness, for example, had a scene where the main character simply sits at home with his partner to watch a movie; if you stay on the couch long enough you can watch To Kill a Mockingbird in its entirety. And The New Order’s best storytelling trick is the way it contrives situations for you to get up close with the Nazis on conversational terms. As in the astonishing opening scene of Inglourious Basterds where Christoph Waltz’s charming, eloquent SS colonel Hans Landa interrogates a farmer harboring a family of Jews, the Nazis’ evil is brought into disturbing relief when coming from the mouths of cordial, intelligent people. The Old Blood is generally less daring in this regard, though there are a few memorable moments. The first half is set up like a classic escape movie, with Jennings citing Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone as inspirations. And one great confrontation at the game’s midpoint involves primary villain Helga Von Schabbs, a crippled occultist with a penchant for fine wine, but the aftermath turns the game on its head by introducing — unfortunately — zombies. The video games industry needs to declare a five-year moratorium on zombies. While the new Wolfenstein games do a fantastic job of portraying the Nazis in a refreshingly evil way that motivates you to carry on, they can’t do the same for zombies — they’re just too played out. And the Nazi zombies you see here — do zombies retain political affiliation, anyway? — undo much of the good work done to establish a believable, if somewhat fantastical, universe. This is a game that makes gigantic robot dogs genuinely terrifying, so it’s saying something that zombies feel like a step too far. The shuffling dead do at least add a bit of variety to The Old Blood’s shooting action, and the developers are at pains to make them fit into the universe as best possible. ""For players who just want to run through the game shooting then, sure, they’re just zombies,"" says Jennings. ""But for those who want to explore the game, find the newspaper articles, and read all of the letters, they’ll see that we don’t break the world of The New Order."" I don’t disagree, but I do think it’s the wrong direction for the franchise. The New Order stood out because it was so different and unexpected; Nazi zombies make The Old Blood feel cheap and videogamey. But there’s still more than enough in The Old Blood to make it worth picking up for New Order players, especially considering its entry price. I wouldn’t normally get into a discussion of ""value"" when writing about a game, much less try to quantify it — time and money mean different things to different people. These days $60 can get you a sweeping epic like The Witcher 3 or a blink-and-you-miss-it blast like The Order: 1886. But it’s worth noting that The Old Blood’s running time of six to eight hours makes the $20 price point very generous; many shorter games sell for three times as much. If anything, I’d have preferred The Old Blood to be a little shorter and punchier. It’s as substantial as most full single-player first-person shooters, though its development was clearly made possible by last year’s $60 release of The New Order. ""I couldn’t say why more publishers don’t go down this route,"" says  Jennings of the decision to make it a stand-alone game rather than downloadable add-on content. ""It’s been done before, but it’s certainly quite rare. It just made the most sense for what we were making."" I hope other publishers take heed. But despite this, I wouldn’t recommend The Old Blood to those who haven’t played The New Order. While the earlier game is a heart-stopping ride that restored my faith in the potential of action video games to spin a good yarn, The Old Blood is simply a great, inexpensive first-person shooter with some of the same DNA. And I’ll take that. Wolfenstein 3D popularized the genre all the way back in 1992, and MachineGames has put the series right back at the forefront of relevance today.

Eddy Cue has tweeted that quality varies depending on whether you're listening on Wi-Fi and cellular; presumably this means Apple Music streams at its maximum bitrate of 256kbps (AAC) when you're on a decent Wi-Fi network. But on a mobile network, what you're hearing could be at a lower quality — and there's currently no way to adjust it. Thankfully, Apple Insider reports that'll be changing with the release of iOS 9. @cue @HiFiGuy528 So it’s never 256 if you’re on cellular? Would be nice for users to have option of choosing.  In the third developer beta of the new software, released earlier today, Apple has added a toggle to the Music settings menu that lets you listen at ""high quality"" on cellular networks no matter how strong your signal may be. Right beneath the option, Apple warns that enabling it will ""use more cellular data and songs may take longer to start playing."" Interestingly there's nothing about pauses or buffering in that text, so Apple Music may cache enough of a song to ensure there are no random interruptions once it starts playing. Update: Read the iOS 9 review. Apple has confirmed it will release a public beta of iOS 9 sometime in July, giving users the chance to turn on this feature during the initial trial of Apple Music. Of course, the ""high quality on cellular"" setting could vanish before that happens if Apple hears too many complaints from developers testing the software. But some people wouldn't mind risking the occasional delay if it meant getting the best possible listening experience, and this is something that most every other streaming service already offers. The question is can they really tell the difference? ",0.6212818395750167,0.3787181604249833,0.17801437448775706,313,4.8722044728434506,209,5.6220095693779903,1,0,"Apple, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The most advanced commercial CPUs of today are built using a 14nm process and there are plans afoot for 10nm chips in 2016, but shrinking manufacturing any further has proven challenging and not at all straightforward. ""7nm node has remained out of reach due to a number of fundamental technology barriers,"" says IBM, with the most notable among them being the material properties of silicon itself. IBM's group of collaborators, which includes Samsung and the SUNY Polytechnic Institute, replaced pure silicon with a silicon-germanium (SiGe) alloy for the channel transistors to improve electron mobility at that minuscule scale. It also employed Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography to etch the microscopic patterns into each chip. This isn't the first time that IBM has dipped below the 10nm bar with its research into future chip technology, as back in 2012 the company demonstrated 9nm transistors built out of carbon nanotubes. The present 7nm SiGe transistors appear to be somewhat more viable for commercial production, though they're still at least a few years away from reaching that stage. Once they do, IBM anticipates they'll offer ""close to 50 percent area scaling improvements over today’s most advanced 10nm technology."" In other words, a processor built at 7nm is expected to have twice the power density of one built at 10nm. It's the generation after the next generation. The future is even tinier than you can imagine IBM's announcement today is a major milestone in its five-year, $3 billion research program to ""push the limits of chip technology needed to meet the emerging demands of cloud computing and Big Data systems."" That's really at the heart of the grand old company's efforts: it's advancing manufacturing techniques only as a means to augment its cloud and big data services. Part of that shift was this month's completion of the sale of IBM's chipmaking unit to GlobalFoundries, a semiconductor foundry that was spun off from AMD back in 2009. GlobalFoundries is a member of the research group that successfully produced the new 7nm node chips, and it will serve as IBM's exclusive processor manufacturer for the next 10 years. And so, even as IBM exits the business of making chips itself, it continues to work on designing and refining the chips that will power our collective future.",0.6077843892691777,0.39221561073082234,0.6843107733505426,423,5.122931442080378,270,6.0185185185185182,0,0,Tech,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We've already reviewed it, but in the eight months since it launched, the Echo has grown considerably with new capabilities, integrations, and connected home control. For the moment, Amazon shows no signs of slowing this train down. Is it a gimmick, a marginally useful niche gadget, or something more? Several members of our staff have now set up Echoes in their homes; for some, it’s an idle curiosity, but for others there’s a genuine hope that it’ll solve some real-world problems. Here are The Verge’s Echo users in their own words.     The foundation of the Echo is a ridiculously simple concept: it’s an always-on mic and speaker that connects to a cloud. It’s effectively Siri, disembodied from its iPhone. That’s it. At first blush, that sounds alright, I suppose. I use Siri perhaps a few times a month, more often as a joke or a fleeting form of entertainment than anything else. (""What’s zero divided by zero?"" is the jokey Siri answer du jour.) And when I started using an Echo a few weeks ago, that’s exactly how we interacted — only very rarely, and mostly as a curiosity. At launch, Echo’s capabilities were relatively limited; it could play music off Amazon’s not-very-useful Prime streaming service, tell you about the weather, answer simple questions with answers readily available in Wikipedia or a calculator, and not much more. But the boundaries of Echo’s cloud-based brain are dynamic, and Amazon is scaling those boundaries very, very quickly — especially now that Echo is graduating from an invite-only beta to a product that anyone can buy. In recent weeks, for instance, Amazon has added Pandora integration and support for controlling some popular connected home devices. Pandora may not be my music service of choice, but as an ambient source of jazz while I’m working, it’s an awful lot better than Amazon Prime Music. Granted, Spotify integration would be wonderful, and the rate at which the Echo is evolving behind the scenes gives me hope that we’ll get there pretty quickly. But I also use Hue lights, which my Echo now controls. I have the good (and bad) fortune of living in a microscopic Manhattan apartment, which means I could afford to outfit my entire place with Hue bulbs. With the Echo, I quite literally don’t touch light switches anymore. ""Alexa, turn off the living room lights"" gets the job done. It’s one of those exceedingly rare, legitimate Jetsons moments. And this is where I noticed the magic starting to happen: the Echo — and by extension, my home — is silently evolving, getting smarter. Meanwhile, I’m growing accustomed to talking at a nondescript black cylinder. We’re meeting in the middle. I no longer feel strange about issuing Alexa commands, and it no longer feels like an idle curiosity to do so. We’re growing and learning together. I now use it daily. It’s a transition that happened seamlessly, and I’m to the point now that I’d miss it if it were gone. In retrospect, it’s crazy to me that Google didn’t randomly toss out an Echo-like ""Google Now box"" during one of its notoriously wild I/O keynotes at some point in the past several years. It seems like such a Google concept! But here we are: it’s Amazon, not Google, that just committed $100 million to grow voice technology and the Echo’s capabilities. I’ll be interested to find out what new tricks my apartment-with-ears learns over time. The smartphone, having now fully made the shift from magic future box to commodity product, has given way to a restless search for the next trillion-dollar game changer. Some say it’s AR, some say it’s VR, some say it’s wearables. Having lived with this Echo for a while, I can’t help but feel like the industry slept on another possibility altogether.     I’ve only had the Echo (a review unit) for a little over a week, so I haven’t gotten to the point that Chris has yet — it’s not an essential part of my apartment. But I feel like I want it to be. There are dusty, unvisited parts of my digital life that I’m revisiting for the first time in years because of the Echo. I’ve never wanted smart bulbs, but now I’m considering buying a set of Hue light bulbs. I’ve never bothered with TuneIn, but maybe the idea that I could get more nuanced news and music from it is intriguing. More than anything, the fact that I’ve actually bothered to look at my Amazon music locker is telling. It’s one of those Amazon Prime services that I just plain forget exists. But Amazon’s streaming music library is so weak, I’ve looked at setting up my own playlists there. It’s just too bad that Prime Music is a threadbare service. Even so, it’s notable that Amazon has created every company’s dream gadget: a device that compels me to find a way to use that company’s other services. The team behind the Fire Phone must be beside themselves at the attention the Echo has garnered. But what I’m actually excited about is Amazon’s just-announced initiatives to let any hardware developer make an Alexa-device and any software developer plug into it. The Echo is nice, but I want more. I want an Alexa-powered alarm clock (pour one out for the Chumby), a waterproof Alexa Bluetooth speaker in the shower. I want to holler questions and demands from anywhere in my apartment and have devices cater to my whims. I want everything listening, all the time. Except, well, maybe I don’t? My fiancée has various nicknames for the Echo, none of them flattering: The Listener, Spy Tube, and That Damned Speaker. Yes, in theory it’s not listening all the time, only activating its connection to the cloud when it hears its command word. But I’m placing a remarkable amount of trust in the Echo’s security model, Amazon’s beneficence, and that the developers who make apps for it won’t be able to abuse it. I should be troubled by all the disturbing possibilities raised by having a listening device constantly connected to a giant retail empire in my home. But I can reorder AA batteries for my Xbox controller by plaintively asking Alexa at the precise moment I’m digging through a junk drawer and realize I’m about to run out.   My experiences with the Echo (I’ve been using one for slightly longer than Dieter, but not as long as Chris) are similar to my colleagues'. (You could even say many of my sentiments echo theirs.) But I’m not as bullish on it as they are, simply because I’m not willing to bend my life around it to make it most useful. Neither is my wife, who is home the most and would potentially benefit the most from the Echo’s features. I don’t use the Echo to play music simply because, as my colleagues have already noted, Pandora is terrible and Amazon’s Prime Music is even worse. This could change if Amazon added support for Spotify or Apple Music, but given Spotify’s commitment to its own Connect service and Apple’s general approach to working with others, I’m not optimistic that the Echo will ever support those. The Echo can be used as a Bluetooth speaker, but that requires pairing each device individually to it and, frankly, takes the whole novelty out of using the Echo. (A few days after I placed the Echo in our kitchen, my wife asked when the Sonos speaker that used to be there would return because it was too much of a hassle to play the music she wanted to listen to with the Echo.) That leaves the Echo to be primarily an assistant for me. I can use it to turn off the Philips Hue lights in my office, which is admittedly cool, but only marginally more convenient than just tapping the button in the app on my phone or watch. I can ask it what the weather is going to be like, but by the time I’ve done that, my phone is already alerting me to the day’s weather, and I didn’t even have to ask it to do so. I can ask it random trivia, but that’s also something I can do with my phone almost as easily, and the novelty wears off quickly anyways. I could reorder items I’ve purchased from Amazon Prime with the Echo, but I’ve yet to do so because, aside from diapers, which are already delivered to me automatically through Amazon’s own Subscribe and Save program, I don’t really buy the same things from Amazon over and over. The one thing that I was really hoping to use the Echo for was managing my family’s shared groceries list. Apple’s Reminders works really well for this: my wife and I can share a single list on our phones (I can even sync it my Android phone with a couple of apps) and we can add items to it with Siri. But adding things to our list while my head is in the pantry or refrigerator by just barking commands at Alexa would be even easier. Amazon advertises the ability to sync the Echo’s shopping list with iOS’ Reminders, but it relies on a hacky IFTTT recipe that has worked far less often than it has failed for me. Then there’s the premise of using the Echo entirely with your voice. In my home, where I share space with a noisy toddler and almost as noisy infant, voice commands sent to the Echo are either frequently interrupted or misinterpreted by others in the house as conversation with them. (Anyone who has an inquisitive toddler knows that anytime you open your mouth, they want to be a part of the conversation.) Amazon could do some things to make using the Echo without your voice easier, such as making one of the two buttons on it pause music with a single tap, but right now all I can do is change the volume or pull out my smartphone. There are points of brilliance with the Echo: the voice recognition is often accurate and it’s able to give responses more quickly than smartphones. (I’ve also found the ring light to be charming, especially how it is brightest in the direction where a voice command is coming from, almost as if it’s looking at you.) There’s a lot of potential here (and as Dieter noted, Amazon’s recent announcement of allowing third-party devices access to Alexa could result in some really interesting and potentially more useful things), but I can’t shake the feeling that a similar product from Apple or Google would work better for me, simply because I don’t want to convert my entire life over to Amazon’s inferior services. Amazon has been aggressively updating the Echo since its debut late last year, and if it continues doing so, the Echo we have in six months could be wildly different than the Echo we have today. If you’re the type that is happy to be a beta tester of sorts, the Echo can be a fun little novelty that isn’t prohibitively expensive. But as a life-changing device, it’s not quite there yet.      I love my Echo, but it’s a hazy, bittersweet love defined by a sense of inevitable doom. I am in a May-December romance with a digital assistant, and we’re probably not going to stay in touch when it’s over. What the Alexa is, more than anything, is a killer proof of concept. Turns out having a computer that stays in one place waiting for spoken commands is a terrific idea. And the execution is great. The Echo’s directional noise-canceling microphone is excellent; the little trick where the LED ring on top follows you around the room as you speak is delightful. The voice recognition is solid. About the only hardware flaw in the Echo is the speaker itself, which is a little flat and muffled. But it’s fine; it’s at least as good as the cheap iPhone speaker dock we’ve kept in the kitchen for years. But as soon as you get past the hardware to software and services, the Echo reveals itself to be a good idea awaiting great execution. Prime Music only has a million tracks in its streaming library, compared to 30 million for nearly every other service, so it’s just missing a bunch of stuff. (I like the Echo so much I almost paid $24.99/year to upload my old iTunes library to Amazon’s locker service to improve the selection, which is a terrible use of money.) The Echo iPhone app hasn’t been updated for the iPhone 6, and is really just a web wrapper that doesn’t quite work right, so the whole thing feels sloppy. And, most damningly, the Echo doesn’t know the difference between me and my wife, so it’s far less useful to her because it’s so deeply connected to my Amazon account and other services. But it’s the relative weakness of Amazon’s services that kind of doom the Echo: you can see Apple or Google or Microsoft releasing a similar product that more seamlessly connects to their more-dominant ecosystems. It would be wild if Apple put Siri in the next Apple TV and AirPlay speakers around the house could connect to it, like a next-generation hybrid of Jarvis and Sonos. Google Now is begging for an Echo-like implementation. And Microsoft’s Cortana is brilliant but begging for a signature product; Windows Phone just isn’t going to cut it. I don’t know if any of that is going to happen; it might not. But I do know that I keep bumping up against the Echo’s limitations in a way that suggests this relationship will burn hot and bright until it burns right out.

Despite spending around $7.2 billion to acquire Nokia’s phone business, Microsoft isn’t making any money out of Windows Phones and has decided to write off most of its Nokia deal to the tune of $7.6 billion today. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been cleaning out former Nokia executives recently, and just made a decision to cut another 7,800 jobs primarily in the company’s phone business. Nadella doesn’t want to be in the business of mass-producing multiple phones anymore — he wants Microsoft to focus on what it can do well with mobile now and in the future. Windows Phones still matter to Microsoft, just not in the traditional sense. Nadella has new plans for Lumia, and they involve flagships, low-cost devices, and business phones, but beyond that, the future of Windows Phone is very vague. Although Microsoft doesn’t want to admit it, the company has lost out on mobile. That much is clear from weak Windows Phone sales, a lack of carrier interest, and no real support from global phone brands like HTC, Samsung, Sony, and LG. Mixed together with a lack of interest from developers to create apps for Microsoft’s platform, the situation makes it difficult to convince consumers to buy Windows Phones, let alone device makers to create them. Windows Phone hasn't been growing enough Nadella has talked about the need to drive costs down for the company’s phone business, and Microsoft has been focused on low-end Lumia devices for quite some time. While Lumia sales have been increasing thanks to cheaper devices, overall market share has actually decreased because Android and iOS are still growing quicker. In other words, Microsoft is stuck — so what can it do?   Nadella’s restructuring will likely reduce the phone business’ confusing numbering schemes and huge selection of handsets, but Nadella doesn’t really clarify what it all means, simply saying it will be a ""more effective phone portfolio"" with ""better products."" Microsoft's new phone approach feels similar to Apple's Microsoft’s new approach feels like it might be similar to Apple’s small selection of iPhones, but Microsoft doesn't share Apple's deep mobile ecosystem to attract consumers in the same way. Microsoft’s plan has been to grow market share through more handset sales while attracting app developers to create a mobile ecosystem, but that plan has obviously failed. Microsoft’s previous message had been that universal apps and Windows 10 can spur interest in Windows Phones, but a similar promise for Windows 8 and its touch-friendly tiled interface didn’t work out. Now, the message is much more mixed. With the addition of Android and iOS app support for Windows 10 Mobile, Microsoft has signaled to developers that it’s okay to ignore developing directly for Windows on mobile devices and just port existing apps across. Combine that with some changes Microsoft is making to the interface and features of Windows 10 Mobile, Cortana for iOS / Android, and a continued mobile push on rival platforms, and it’s easy to conclude that Windows Phone has very few unique capabilities anymore. Will any phone maker step in to save Windows Phone? Even if it can begin to solve the app gap issue, it’s still unclear whether third-party manufacturers are willing to come back to Windows Phone. With Microsoft’s Lumia phones accounting for more than 90 percent of Windows Phone marketshare, it’s unlikely that any other phone maker like Samsung, LG, or HTC will step in to create Windows Phones at scale to fill the gap and truly make it a viable third ecosystem. This restructuring could result in a small selection of phones that are more like Microsoft’s Surface range of tablets, simple options that are focused on their respective  price points. Windows chief Terry Myerson is taking over all of Microsoft’s device businesses, including Xbox, Surface, Lumia, HoloLens, and the Microsoft Band. By merging the Windows engineering and devices teams together, you could reasonably expect that future phones will be closely integrated and pick up unique features for Windows users. That might be the case — after all, Myerson was behind Microsoft’s secret efforts to build a Surface Phone. This strategy might work for business phones and flagship devices for Windows fans, but that’s a small market compared to mobile overall. But perhaps that’s the reality of Microsoft’s mobile situation.  Microsoft is being forced to skate to where the puck will be Ultimately, Microsoft is now being forced to skate to where the puck will be, not where it has been. If you believe technology companies, then we’ll all be wearing computers in the future and letting them drive us around. If you look at where Microsoft sees the future — HoloLens — then it’s clear the company sees its mobile future focused outside the smartphone. ""Our reinvention will be centered on creating mobility of experiences across the entire device family including phones,"" says Nadella — but in order to do that, Microsoft needs a lot of data from sensors and a deeper understanding of the world to move computing beyond a desk or pocket and into every aspect of our lives. Microsoft already learns a lot from its Xbox Live efforts, whether it’s consumer habits or machine learning, and it needs those millions of Windows Phones out there right now to learn from the many sensors in these modern devices. Likewise, the Microsoft Band provides rich data, and its appearance right now feels like a research lab project. By moving phones and devices into the Windows division, it’s clear that the company is setting itself up to try not to miss the next personal wave of computing. It’s hard to imagine Microsoft will kill off its Lumia line fully, because it still needs to be invested in smartphones for its own mobile apps and services. Even Nadella says that’s not going to happen, stating that he is ""committed to our first-party devices including phones."" By aligning Lumia, Surface, and Xbox with the Windows division, it’s easy to mask any continued losses and keep funding them without investors pushing Microsoft too hard. It’s also a more realistic view of where Windows Phone stands today: a test project. It's a little like Google's Nexus program: a thing Microsoft feels compelled to make so it has a mobile platform to work with. But unlike the Nexus program, there's not a viable ecosystem of phone makes or app developers right now that it can inspire. If it was anything more at this point, Microsoft would have made a far larger investment in its software. It feels like Microsoft is admitting defeat Windows 10 Mobile is coming later in the year after Windows 10 for PCs, and with only a few months to go it’s in a rough preview state. Microsoft is increasingly focused on keeping its enterprise base of loyal PC users happy for Windows 10, and not on mobile or the touch interfaces that Windows 8 users disliked. It feels like Microsoft is admitting defeat and readying itself for a different kind of mobile future instead of worrying about the smartphone war it will never win.

The internet TV's rise and fall is a well-known tale that pitted Chet Kanojia's startup against the Goliath cable networks, who ultimately felled Aereo with a US Supreme Court victory. Most people might not know that after that whole saga, TiVo made off with Aereo's trademarks, customer email list, and other intellectual property, all for a cool $1 million paid in bankruptcy court. TiVo Inc. recently purchased a number of the Aereo assets because we share Aereo's disruptive spirit and are committed to viewers who want to save money, still get a great DVR service, and do so without having to pay a cable or satellite bill. Has the company utilized Aereo's technology to improve its own lineup of DVRs and conquer the TV box market? Not exactly. Right now, TiVo is basically using its Aereo winnings to spam customers of the old service with DVR offers.   Aereo's transition officer is TiVo's marketing boss I've seen some complaints and news stories about TiVo's ploy over the last couple of days, but this isn't a new development. These emails from the ""Aereo Transition Officer"" — his name is Brody Smith, if you can't tell by the lack of a typed signature — have been going out for weeks now. Apparently the role, which sounds mighty official, involves nothing more than hawking Roamio's hardware aimed at cord cutters. Seeing as Brody Smith is in fact TiVo's director of marketing, it makes total sense.   And as The Consumerist recently pointed out, the ""deals"" that TiVo is blasting out to Aereo's old customer list sometimes don't offer any legitimate savings anyway. And yet, according to the first email I got, TiVo would have you believe it's ""fulfilling the Aereo promise."" Apparently making good on Chet Kanojia's vision involves pestering people about products that, in 2015, aren't quite as revelatory and groundbreaking as they once were. Plenty of us want to see TiVo doing better, but this isn't an encouraging sign. More examples of TiVo's spam play below.     No, Brody Smith. This isn't so awesome. It's extremely disingenuous in fact, since as they're written, these emails appear to come from a company that no longer exists. Aereo's legacy deserves better. You've had a few months to flash your products at everyone who partook in a pretty amazing (if flawed and illegal) experiment. Sure, unsubscribing from all TiVo marketing takes just a couple clicks, but enough's enough already.

The plan is widely being called the strongest action ever taken by the US to curb the effects of climate change. But the move — which bases its target on carbon levels recorded in 2005 — isn't just big for the US, it's also big for Obama himself, as the president is making use of the executive authority he possesses under the 1970 Clean Air Act to implement the regulation. hundreds of coal-fired power plants will face closure The new rule, issued by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), mainly targets coal-fired power plants, which emit more carbon than any other type of plant. There are more than 600 such plants in the US and hundreds will face closure should the new regulation make it through the barrage of legal attacks it's bound to ignite. The new plan will also drastically change the American electricity industry, reports The New York Times, especially regarding how power is generated and used. To help implement these changes, the EPA's plan provides states with a number of policy options that will allow them to curb carbon pollution. If a state can make changes to its electricity grid by installing wind and solar technologies, for instance, it won't have to shut down its coal-fired power plants. States can also cap carbon at a certain level, and allow various companies to buy and sell permits to pollute. But if a state fails to come up with an adequate solution, reports USA Today, the EPA will have the authority to step in and make its own changes. The New York Times reports that the plan could cost up to $8.8 billion annually, but it could also provide the US with up to $93 billion in economic benefits in the long run. ""The plan will clean the air we breathe"" Most states will have until 2016 to come up with their own plan, but the AP reports that in some cases, states will have until 2018 to submit a proposal. This might make it difficult for the US to reduce its overall carbon pollution levels by 25 percent by 2020, as the plan suggests. ""This plan will clean the air we breathe while helping slow climate change so we can leave a safe and healthy future for our kids,"" said EPA administrator Gina McCarthy. Predictably, many government officials and coal industry representatives expressed discontent regarding the regulation. ""I will fight President Obama and anyone else who tries to undermine our coal jobs,"" said Natalie Tennant, West Virginia democratic Senate candidate, in a statement. But some companies, including Unilever and the VF company, which manages clothing brands like The North Face and Timberland, have publicly embraced the EPA's regulation. The president has asked the EPA to finalize the plans, which are now open for public comment, by June 2015. This will allow the administration to jumpstart the program before Obama leaves office. The plan is unlikely to halt climate change all on its own given that China is the world's largest emitter of carbon pollution, and that many developing countries are resistant to the idea of curbing pollution at the expense of their own economic growth. But the extent of the new regulation might finally give the US the moral authority it needs to put more pressure on China and India to make changes of their own. Frances Beineck, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, told The Wall Street Journal that although time is running out, ""today the president is reminding us that we have the solutions.""",0.721037530280425,0.27896246971957495,0.85223361768103,622,4.834405144694534,328,5.7865853658536581,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And what's more worrisome is that no nation has managed to significantly decrease its obesity rates in the last 33 years. 47 percent rise in obesity among kids In the study, researchers at Washington University used data from 188 countries collected between 1980 and 2013 to determine how the prevalence of overweight and obese people has changed over time. Predictably, the results aren't good, reports The Wall Street Journal. The researchers found that the number of overweight and obese adults rose by 28 percent in just 33 years. And in children, that number rose by 47 percent. The scientists also reported obesity rates by country and, as it turns out, the highest rise in obesity among men occurred in New Zealand, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. The rise in obesity among women overlapped somewhat, Reuters reports, as it was highest in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Honduras, and Bahrain. In the US, ""roughly a third of men and women were obese"" in 2013, the researchers write. But countries like South Africa, where 42 percent of women are obese, and Tonga, where 50 percent of adults are obese, are even more alarming.  (Ng et al., The Lancet) The study — the most comprehensive of its kind to date — didn't determine why this increase has taken place, but it did cite the usual suspects. These include poor diet, physical inactivity, and metabolism. Even the less well-know gut microbiome made an appearance among possible reasons for the sharp rise.     the rise will continue in the developing world   Given these results, the authors conclude that halting the rise in obesity by 2025 — a goal set by the World Health Organization — is ""very ambitious and unlikely to be attained without concerted action.""

That's a whole year ahead of NASA's schedule — the space agency hoped to launch in 2017 or 2018 — but Musk said the first flights of the new craft will be unmanned. Those first test flights will simulate the presence of humans to ensure all systems are functional. The Dragon V2 was designed as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Development program, which stipulates that competing firms develop craft capable of delivering four crew members into space, before returning them safely. Three other firms, Boeing, Blue Origin, and Sierra Nevada, also received funding from NASA to create their own vehicles. The US currently pays Russia $60 million per person to ship humans to the ISS, but increased tensions between the two countries over Russia's actions in Ukraine have led to questions about the future of their joint space projects. In April, NASA ended its communications with Russian government officials and scientists. In apparent retaliation, the Russian deputy prime minister said his country would block a US request to use the ISS after 2020. Referring to the apparent breakdown in relations, Musk said in April that now would be ""a good time"" for SpaceX to unveil its new vehicle.",0.8712578011068214,0.12874219889317862,0.8850480349716149,451,4.9955654101995561,274,6.0985401459854014,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Of course, that was just the beginning for SpaceX — Musk is nothing if not ambitious — and the company's next goal is to tackle manned space flight.  Last night at its Hawthorne, California headquarters, SpaceX unveiled its newest capsule, the Dragon V2. Designed as a reusable craft for up to seven astronauts, the V2 differs from its predecessor not just in terms of what it carries but how it gets back home; according to Musk, the new craft disposes with the concept of ocean splashdowns altogether, and ""can land anywhere on Earth with the accuracy of a helicopter."" With a touchscreen control system, 3D printed engines, and a slick, minimalist interior, the V2 feels so close to science fiction it's hard to believe it exists — but we were there last night and took a step inside.  The SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California. While the company limits photography inside the facility due to its government work, walking inside is like stepping into a mash-up of 2001 and Iron Man. Mirrored windows and doors cut off all view of the outside world, while glass conference rooms are named after space visionaries like Wernher von Braun, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and Sir Isaac Newton. The building itself is a huge industrial facility, but the attention was on the shape hiding behind the curtain. SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk took the stage to tout the accomplishments of the Dragon capsule, but he was clearly more excited to show the world what he termed a true ""21st century spacecraft."" With a theatrical flourish and plenty of smoke, the Dragon V2 made its first appearance. A close-up of the capsule's exotic logo. According to SpaceX, the Dragon V2 can land basically anywhere in the world with incredible precision. Designed — and built — in California. A demo video showed off an impressive landing sequence, with the Dragon V2 entering Earth's atmosphere, using its thrusters to control the speed of descent, and then briefly hovering over the ground before setting down on its four legs. After a rolling staircase was brought on stage, Musk opened the door of the V2 and stepped inside. There are a total of seven seats inside the craft: a top row of four, with three additional seats set right below. The bottom row looked rather cramped, though it likely wouldn't be as problematic in a zero-G environment. Large windows adorn either side, but otherwise the interior was sparse and futuristic. It wasn't clear if the blue and purple lighting will be used in actual space flight, but it made for a beautiful demo. The interface comes courtesy of four large touchscreens, which Musk says are similar to those found in Tesla cars. The screens are set on a hinge, so once the astronauts crawl up into their chairs they can swing the bank of displays around to face them. Should the screens fail for any reason, there are hardware controls for all the essential functions as fallback. Which is probably a good idea; we've seen Gravity.

Now, it's found a partner for that show: a subsidiary of Endemol, the entertainment company best known for Big Brother. UK-based production house DSP focuses on documentaries and dramas, including Touching the Void, a critically acclaimed 2003 film about climbers Joe Simpson and Simon Yates' nearly fatal attempt to climb the Siula Grande in Peru. It's also produced TV specials about space tourism and the end of the Space Shuttle program. With Mars One, it will film what the companies say will be a series broadcast ""around the world."" Taking Mars One's mission at face value is, well, a giant leap. Like any other crewed Mars mission, it has huge hurdles to cross, and it has relatively little time in which to do so. Its entertainment deals will also have to provide a great deal of funding to match something like SpaceX, let alone NASA, which is currently planning its own trip to Mars in the 2030s. We're not sure how much closer, if any, this partnership puts Mars One towards its goal. But it's managed to secure a tentative deal for an uncrewed 2018 test flight with Lockheed Martin and SSTL, and given the low risks involved in every stage up to the actual flight, it's been generally welcomed as a way to promote space exploration. After receiving 200,000 applications in an open call for astronauts, Mars One narrowed the pool to around 1,000 late last year, and 705 people are currently in the running. Under DSP's cameras, they'll take part in an ""elite training program run by a panel comprised of pre-eminent scientists, adventurers and astronauts,"" designed to evaluate their mastery of vital technical skills as well as physical and mental fitness. Previously, Mars One has said that audiences may play a role in the selection. The first episodes of the show are expected in early 2015, but there's not much detail beyond that, although more is supposed to be forthcoming. The actual selection process, according to Mars One's roadmap, will end with around six teams of four people being picked for training, and more people will be picked every year, all of them hoping to make a trip to Mars and never come back.",0.4751348664795315,0.5248651335204685,0.7536863672260045,400,4.8525,261,5.7624521072796933,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Studios will likely be unhappy with the recommendation though, as it could significantly cut into one of their major marketing streams.  The guidelines apply to films released from October 1st onward  The new guidelines also hope to stop viewers from pulling out their phones in the theater.

The guidelines go into effect for all movies advertised for a release on October 1st or later. You may not start seeing those films' trailers until closer to their premiere though, as NATO now wants to see in-theater marketing limited to within 120 days of a movie's release, instead of 150 as it has been. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the guidelines come after months of discussion between NATO and film studios. Theater owners are apparently unhappy with the length of trailers — with many reportedly believing that they reveal too much of the film — and with the number of trailers shown before each picture — an issue that's drawn complaints from viewers. While shorter trailers could help to mitigate those problems, it could also allow theaters to run more trailers and potentially bring in more advertising revenue, rather than using the opportunity to please viewers. The guidelines are voluntary though, and it's unclear how much impact they'll immediately have.

According to Bloomberg, Charter and Comcast are close to striking a deal that would sell significant TWC assets to Comcast if Charter's buyout attempt goes through. The deal would both provide Charter with much-needed funding to finance the offer and remove Comcast — a cable provider bigger than both Charter and TWC — from the list of potential bidders. Removing Comcast as a potential buyer will also help Charter convince TWC's stockholders that they're unlikely to see a better bid than what it's offering.  TWC's New York City, New England, and North Carolina assets would go to Comcast The deal would give TWC's New York City, New England, and North Carolina cable assets to Comcast if Charter's purchase of TWC goes through, reports Bloomberg. TWC is said to have around 3 million subscribers throughout those markets. But Charter's success in buying TWC is still far from certain. Its offer has been rebuffed by TWC three times now, with TWC's executives making it clear that they felt its offer — reportedly $132.50 per share (around $37.4 billion in cash and stock) — was too low. Charter has since begun appealing directly to TWC's shareholders in an attempt to have them begin pushing for the buyout on their own. According to Bloomberg, TWC's shareholders are looking for at least $140 per share — higher than Charter's latest offer, but lower than the $150-$160 per share than TWC execs have been seeking. Charter will reportedly borrow $20 billion to finance the deal, with funding from Comcast sitting on top of that. For Comcast, making a deal with Charter may also give it a way to get a piece of TWC while avoiding major regulatory hurdles that likely would have threatened the deal had it gone in on its own. Though Charter is a smaller company than TWC, it appears to see this as an auspicious time to begin building for the future. One of the major catalysts of this aggressive stance is John Malone, the so-called Darth Vader of the cable industry, who's taken a stake in Charter through his Liberty Media investment group. Despite his reputation, convincing enough shareholders will still be a struggle, but we may see how the takeover attempt plays out soon.

Revenues hit $57.6 billion, a new quarterly record for the company, while profits reached $13.1 billion, equal to the quarterly record set last year and continuing the trend of shrinking profit margins at Cupertino. After surging to over $700 in 2012, Apple's share price fell to under $400 in 2013. It's slowly recovered since, standing at around $551 prior to today's earnings call. The positive results should persuade investors that the company still has room to grow, albeit at a slower rate.  A record quarter for iPhone and iPad The company's financial Q1, which covers October to December, is traditionally its strongest. Buoyed by the release of the iPad Air, iPad mini with Retina display, and the first full quarter of iPhone 5S and 5C sales, it should come as no surprise that Apple's iOS devices did very well. iPhone sales broke 50 million for the first time in a single quarter, reaching 51 million, while iPad sales also set a new record of 26 million. Those figures are staggeringly high for a company with a relatively small product range. Once Apple's savior, iPod sales slumped further to just 6 million — down from 12.7 million this time last year.  Although Apple doesn't give a full breakdown of iPad and iPhone models sold, there's some insight to be taken from ASP, the average selling price of a device range. Over the past year, ASP has dropped to historically low levels, from $613 in Q2 2013 down to $577 in Q4 2013. That figure rose for the first time in a while this quarter, up to $636. That figure is still slightly under this time last year when the average iPhone was selling for $642. iPhone ASP rose for the first time in a year The rise implies that more users are opting for Apple's flagship iPhone 5S, rather than the cheaper iPhone 5C and iPhone 4S. There have been many rumors that the iPhone 5C is not selling well, although some have suggested that the lower-cost model will rise in popularity as early adopters generally pick more expensive models. iPad ASP, which fell sharply following the introduction of the popular iPad mini, rose slightly this quarter from $439 to $440, showing no indication of change after the introduction of iPad Air and iPad mini with Retina display.  Macs performed well, despite some analysts' predictions Although Macs accounted for less than 13 percent of Apple's overall revenue last year, they still represent an important part of the company's business, 30 years after their first introduction. Sales have been something of an enigma recently, with key analysts Gartner and IDC disagreeing massively on the number of computers Apple has sold in the US this quarter: Gartner said sales were up 28.5 percent, while IDC saw a 5.7 percent slump. In reality, Mac revenues hit $6.4 billion in Q1, representing 4.8 million Macs sold. That's a good rise from last year's $5.5 billion revenue and 4 million Macs sold, and a fairly big error for IDC. Looking to next quarter, Apple expects revenues to be fairly flat. The company is known for giving conservative estimates to investors, and predicts revenue in the range of $42 billion to $44 billion. In Q2 2013, Apple made $9.5 billion profit from $43.6 billion revenue. Apple's holding a conference call to discuss the earnings at 5PM ET today, and you can follow along live here.

But he continued to press his message that rich people are being unfairly demonized, and warned that rising tensions could lead to violence. Tom Perkins, who co-founded Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, said he had formally apologized in a letter to the Anti-Defamation League. ""It was a terrible word to have chosen,"" Perkins said of the reference to Kristallnacht, in an interview on Bloomberg West. ""I, like many, have tried to understand the 20th century and the incomprehensible evil of the Holocaust. It can’t be explained. Even to try to explain it is questionable. It's wrong, it’s evil."" Perkins sparked a furor over the weekend with a letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal, where he said a ""rising tide of hatred of the successful one percent"" mirrors the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. His remarks came amid rising tensions in San Francisco, where rising rent and an increase in the number of evictions has focused anger on Silicon Valley tech companies and the private shuttles that ferry their employees to work using public bus stops. Perkins argued that the Occupy movement and San Francisco Chronicle had provoked class warfare in a feat of ""progressive radicalism"" that he likened to attacks against the Jews. ""It's absurd to demonize the rich for being rich."" Appearing on Bloomberg West today, Perkins said that while he regretted his use of the word ""Kristallnacht,"" he stood by his original message. ""I don't regret the message at all,"" he said. ""The message is that any time the majority starts to demonize a minority, no matter what it is, it’s wrong, and dangerous. And no good ever comes from it."" He also said ""the majority"" should not attack the 1 percent. ""It’s absurd to demonize the rich for being rich and for doing what the rich do, which is get richer by creating opportunity for others,"" he said. But he also drew scorn for saying that his Richard Mille watch, estimated to be worth $379,000, ""could buy a six pack of Rolexes."" Kleiner Perkins responded to Perkins' original letter with a tweet saying Perkins had not been involved with the firm for years. ""We were shocked by his views expressed today in the WSJ and do not agree,"" the firm said. ""They chose to sort of throw me under the bus, and I didn't like that,"" Perkins said today.

Samsung and Ericsson have been in patent disputes for some time now, with Reuters reporting in 2012 that Ericsson was initiating a lawsuit after two years of failed licensing attempts. But lately, Samsung appears to be more willing to strike licensing deals. Just yesterday, Samsung announced that it and Google had established a broad patent licensing agreement, and last November, Samsung extended a patent licensing agreement with Nokia for five years. Patent licensing has become a legal battlefield in the tech industry lately, with Samsung the star in one of the biggest conflicts.

There are excellent, immersive, highly customizable apps like Flipboard and Feedly, more curated options like Yahoo News Digest, Circa, and Slashdot founder CmdrTaco’s  Trove — and that’s not even mentioning the full-on firehose of news that is Twitter. Investor, entrepreneur, and blogger Jason Calacanis believes that no one has yet solved the basic problem: an app that truly brings the news into a mobile-first format. But he says his new app Inside, which launches on iPhone, BlackBerry and the mobile web, is the first to crack that problem. Calacanis has been keeping his eye on the state of internet news for a long time. He’s the co-founder of Weblogs, Inc., a group of sites that included Engadget, Joystiq, and Autoblog, which was sold to Aol in 2005. But Inside isn’t a competitor to Aol’s network of sites or the many other places to get news online. Instead, Calacanis is trying to build the best way for news junkies to sift through a customized feed of stories they care about on their smartphones. ""Inside has a mission of building the world's best news product,"" Calacanis told The Verge, ""but we don't want to do any journalism."" It’s a rather audacious goal, but Calacanis thinks he has cracked it by ""making a new unit of content that was designed for the smartphone."" That ""new unit of content,"" which Calacanis calls ""the update,"" is a paragraph that boils the news down to its most essential parts. Inside’s updates are 300 characters (about 40 words) and focus entirely on the facts of the story (Calacanis says the goal is to have 10 facts in each update). Headlines and images are part of the update, and the headline is built to flow right into the main text. ""We studied what people would want [to read] when they were in line at Starbucks, or walking down the block."" And instead of having machines make stories human-readable, Inside has dozens of writers looking for the best content on the internet and re-writing those stories into updates for the apps. ""We have curators, which are college-educated, English-speaking Americans go out, read the best journalism in the world, and we summarize it and categorize it,"" Calacanis says. The limitations of an update mean that, like a tweet, you’re not exactly reading well-crafted prose most of the time, but Calacanis isn’t worried about that. ""We studied what people would want when they were in line at Starbucks, or walking down the block,"" he says, and anyone who wants to read the full story can just tap through to the original source.     The flood of news the app pushes out is somewhat daunting — Inside publishes about 1,000 updates every day across a huge swath of categories. Calacanis told us that Inside has been pushing out 24-hour coverage for over three months in its private beta, and ""people get really addicted to it."" But Inside can also tailor the news you receive based on your own interests and browsing patterns, as well. In addition to the main feed, there’s a custom stream curated for you. Each Inside update is tagged with up to three topics — there are high-level categories like ""tech"" and ""politics"" and also more granular sub-categories like ""Apple"" or ""Barack Obama."" ""We have a TV category, but we also have a *Breaking Bad* and *Game of Thrones* topic, so you can really drill down deep,"" Calacanis explains. Will Inside's algorithm help it outsmart its competitors? Readers can give topics a thumbs up to see more stories like it in their feed, or a thumbs down to ignore similar stories in the future. (There’s also the option to scroll through Inside’s huge list of topics and explicitly add them to your lineup.) This algorithm is the app’s secret to making the news flow manageable — ""it’s looking semantically at what’s in the stories you like and helps customize the My Feed section,"" Calacanis says. Of course, most of Inside’s competitors have developed algorithms of their own, and none have really broken out of the pack — and it’s unclear that Inside’s algorithm is meaningfully different from its many rivals. Beyond the never-ending scroll of stories, users can drill into a category by swiping across the image at the top of the story. By swiping from right to left, you’ll go back in time and see other stories that are tagged in the category, a feature that Calacanis thinks will be particularly useful on breaking news stories where updates are coming in quickly (or when following along with live events like the Grammys). Lastly, Inside features a ""top news"" section that features 25 stories every day picked by Chief Content Officer and Gabriel Synder (formerly of The Wire, The New York Observer, and Variety).  All together, it seems like a comprehensive package for news junkies, and the app will soon be available on more platforms than just iPhone and Blackberry — iPad and Android apps are in the works. (It will ""probably"" land on Windows Phone, as well.) But the question is whether the average user who relies on Twitter, Flipboard or more mainstream news sites will find Inside indispensable. That user will need to take the time to tailor their feed to the things they care about — but if they do, Calacanis believes they’ll be exposed to a lot of great journalism. ""We think that really the big problem today is not that there's not enough journalism, it's that it's competing against so much noise,"" Calacanis says. He noted that there are lots sites ""who will make five or six stories out of one great New York Times article. Those stories that they do aren't providing a ton of value."" It’s a bit of a shot across the bow at blogging culture — despite the fact that Inside is doing a form of reblogging itself. ""We want to be the starting point for people's news discovery."" But Calacanis insists that he wants to point people towards the best writing on the internet that his team can find. ""We want to be the starting point for people's news discovery,"" he says. ""If we can get a couple million people using this as where they start, we help them discover the best stuff."" It’s a lofty, aspirational goal, but it could also be in conflict with Inside’s core functionality. If lots of users click through from Inside to the source articles, it might mean they’re interested in getting more detail — but it might also mean that the summaries aren’t telling the story effectively. But if the summaries are *too* effective at communicating the news, users might not end up sending these sources many eyeballs. It’ll be a fine line for Inside to walk — if the app doesn’t send viewers to the sources, those sources might be less inclined to have their content featured on the app. ""I think it's always possible people will respond and say ‘oh my god, you're summarizing our story,’ but I think what they'll learn is we're rewarding them by sending traffic and not competing with them,"" Calacanis reiterates. ""We want to be the place where people decide what to read, not the place the place where they read.""",0.6478644026070833,0.35213559739291667,0.5072503423285191,1222,4.8117839607201311,583,6.1166380789022297,0,0,"Apps, Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

After making a big move to become the YouTube of viral images, the company built new Android and iPhone apps as well as a full-on meme generator — and its latest new feature could resonate equally with hardcore Imgur users as well as those who advertise on the site. Today, Imgur is launching a full-fledged analytics program that'll let Imgur users track exactly how many people are viewing their images and ""Pro"" users can see which sites on the internet are linking to their images. ""The new feature will let you reconstruct the story behind the image."" ""We've always displayed the total amount of view that the image gets,"" CEO and founder Alan Schaaf tells The Verge, ""but currently you don't really know anything about those views. Where are they coming from, what's the top referrer? All you have is that one number."" Now, Imgur will offer a rich set of analytics including a breakdown of daily and hourly image views and a full list of the websites that are linking back to the original image. Those referring websites are ranked by the number of views each is contributing to the image, and you can drill deep into each referring site to see exactly where the photo is being shared (across any number of sub-Reddits, for example).        ""The new feature will let you reconstruct the story behind the image — you can really see what is happening with your image and be able to tell where on the web it actually went viral,"" Schaaf says. And Imgur is hoping to get this data out to its users as quickly as possible — Schaaf says the company gets data logs every 15 minutes and will try to get the analytics out to users within the hour. While Imgur believes that its users will enjoy watching their images spread across the internet, there's no doubt this new platform is also meant to appeal to advertisers who can purchase sponsored images in the gallery — it'll give advertisers a clearer look at whether their sponsored image is catching on and where it gains traction. ""We're hoping that this is extremely valuable to [advertisers], because they'll be able to really tell in detail if people are hotlinking the image into their blog or putting it on Facebook,"" says Schaaf, ""and we can tell them exactly when it hit Facebook and how many views from Facebook it got."" Imgur's new feature should appeal to Pro users and advertisers alike Imgur is still happy to provide a free service that anyone can use without an account, but the full range of analytics will only be available to those who have a $23 annual Imgur Pro subscription. Anyone, even those without an account, will be able to get the views-over-time graph, while registered users will get a ""scrambled"" version of referring site traffic. ""You're not really sure what [sites are] on top and what's on the bottom,"" says Schaaf. ""It's more of a small snapshot of what happened to your image."" The new analytics will be a nice feature for advertisers and paid users alike, but Schaff says the company is going to keep focusing on its huge customer base — the company says it has doubled the 60 million unique monthly visitors it reported a year ago and is currently seeing 4.5 billion page views every month. Many of those visitors aren't paying, or even registered, but it's not something that troubles Imgur. ""I guess one mentality is that not having people register is a really stupid business plan because then you don't know anything about anyone who's using your platform,"" Schaaf admits. ""But on the other hand, from a user's perspective — which is really what we're focusing on — it's phenomenal. We're the biggest host that lets you upload anonymously.""",0.6460641742227866,0.3539358257772134,0.12036765382776471,660,4.6590909090909092,332,5.6355421686746991,0,0,"Business, Web",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The case centers around Android The case centers around Android — specifically, whether Google infringed on Oracle copyright by using Oracle-owned Java APIs in the operating system without permission. There's legal minutiae abound here, but to put it simply, Google has argued that the APIs are simply a means of working with systems and can't be copyrighted, while Oracle says its code is an original, copyrightable work. After Google won the case in a lower court, an appeals court partially (and controversially) overturned the ruling. If the Supreme Court declines to hear the case, that ruling stands. The implications of the case could be enormous. As Google and others have argued, much of modern technology has been built around the idea that APIs, which allow programs to communicate across platforms, are openly available.

That resolution concerns what's known as ""mobile cramming,"" in which third parties can pass charges along to phone companies for spam SMS messages or things like daily horoscopes and ""fun facts."" Federal investigators found that for years, AT&T made hundreds of millions of dollars by taking 35 percent of these unwanted charges, dodging complaints from customers and reassuring the companies themselves.  ""Wireless companies profited while their customers were fleeced."" AT&T will pay a total $105 million to settle the case. $80 million of that will go to the FTC, which it will use to set up a reimbursement program for cheated customers. $20 million will go to individual states, and the FCC will get $5 million. In addition, AT&T will have to end the program and proactively inform subscribers if extra fees are going on their accounts. While this settlement is unusually large, it's not the first time regulators have taken on cramming. Earlier this year, they went after T-Mobile for similar wrongdoings. These charges usually came in the form of a recurring monthly fee of $9.99 once an AT&T customer signed up for a premium texting service, intentionally or otherwise. Though the FCC and FTC found that AT&T did identify these charges on customers' billing statements, the product descriptions were sometimes as vague as ""Variety Texts."" AT&T received complaints that these charges were unauthorized, and it's alleged that AT&T was at times unable to provide proof that they had been. Even so, AT&T is also said to have only refunded some customers one or two months worth of fees. ""We now know that wireless companies profited while their customers were fleeced by unscrupulous third parties who added millions of dollars in unauthorized charges to consumer phone bills,"" Travis LeBlanc FCC enforcement bureau chief, says in a statement. AT&T has expressed some contrition in a statement. ""While we had rigorous protections in place to guard consumers against unauthorized billing,"" it said, ""last year we discontinued third-party billing for PSMS services."" Now, it says that the ""broad settlement"" will help settle accounts with angry customers. ""This settlement gives our customers who believe they were wrongfully billed for PSMS services the ability to get a refund."" AT&T is also being required to develop and implement a system that will ensure customers provide informed consent before third-party charges are placed on their bills in the future.",0.4464244920152196,0.5535755079847804,0.8812365219446119,447,5.2304250559284116,268,6.0634328358208958,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the decision at a press conference today in Oslo. Satyarthi, an Indian, and Yousafzay, from Pakistan, will share an award of 8 million Swedish kronor ($1.1 million). With today's award, Yousafzay — widely referred to simply as Malala — becomes the youngest to ever win the Peace Prize. ""The Nobel Committee regards it as an important point for a Hindu and a Muslim, an Indian and a Pakistani, to join in a common struggle for education and against extremism,"" the organization said in a statement Friday morning.  The Norwegian Nobel Committee received a record 278 nominations for this year's Peace Prize, including Pope Francis, Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege, and former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Malala was widely touted as a favorite to win last year, before the Committee awarded the honor to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for their work in dismantling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's arsenal of chemical weapons. The teenager garnered international attention in 2012, when she was shot in the head by Taliban gunman for supporting girls' rights to education. The attack left Malala fighting for her life, but she survived and went on to become a global advocate for the education of women. In 2013, she delivered an impassioned speech to the United Nations in New York, and created the Malala Fund to help empower young women around the world. Satyarthi, 60, has spent decades campaigning against child labor. Since its founding in 1989, his organization, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, has focused on providing education and protection to disadvantaged children. He has also played a major role in developing global conventions on children's rights. In its press release, the Nobel Committee praised Satyarthi for ""maintaining Gandhi's tradition"" of peaceful protest and campaigning. (Mahatma Gandhi is also among the most glaring omissions from the list of Peace Prize winners.)  The first Peace Prize was awarded in 1901, as established in the will of Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite.

While Greenwald has pieced out details from the leaks in the press, his NSA reporting partner Laura Poitras has been working on an equally monumental project, a documentary culled from hours of private footage of Snowden and Greenwald as they struggled with one of the most delicate and dangerous acts of journalism in living memory. ""It hardened me to action."" The film is called CitizenFour, and on Friday it made its world premiere at the New York Film Festival. It begins with Poitras's narration of one of her first messages from Snowden: ""At this stage I can offer nothing more than my word,"" she reads. ""I am a senior gov't employee in the intel community."" He signs it with a pseudonym, CitizenFour. What follows is a close look at how the leaks played out from within, following Snowden and Greenwald from the first meeting to more or less the present day. The film's not concerned with breaking news, but we get a new insight into Snowden's state of mind during the leaks and his decision to break with the NSA in such a powerful way. In one scene, he talks about the lo-res video feeds from US surveillance drones, which he could watch from his desk at the NSA. ""It hardened me to action,"" Snowden says.  The most fascinating material comes from the eight days the trio spent in a Hong Kong hotel, hashing out the material for the first stories and the video that would ultimately reveal Snowden to the world. While he works with Greenwald on the documents, Snowden also struggles with the personal fallout from his abrupt flight from the US. He kept his plan secret from everyone in his life, telling his girlfriend only that he was going ""on a work trip."" After the first story goes out, she gets a visit from the NSA, and we see Snowden tear up on hearing the news. ""It is an unusual feeling,"" he says later, looking out on the Hong Kong skyline, ""not knowing what's going to happen in the next day, the next week."" ""It's an unusual feeling, not knowing what's going to happen in the next day."" The rules of operational security are also constantly in play. After talking through some of the documents with Greenwald, we see Snowden wince as he realizes that the hotel room's VOIP phone has been plugged in the whole time. ""They can hot-mic those,"" he tells Greenwald nervously. They unplug the phone, only to hear an unrelated fire alarm bell ring from the hallway a few minutes later, setting off a cascade of paranoia. Days later, once his face has been revealed in the now-famous video, we see real fear on Snowden's face as he prepares to finally leave the hotel room. The biggest tease comes at the end, after Snowden has escaped to Moscow, when Greenwald fills Snowden in on a new story they're working on with a new source, handled by his First Look colleague Jeremy Scahill. He writes the important parts out on paper so they can't be surveilled, and Snowden says he's worried for the new source. Greenwald flashes some details — 1.2 million people on a watch list, a chain of command for drone strikes. (One assumes we'll see them show up in The Intercept before long.) Snowden seems shocked at the details; they're news even to him. Once the meeting is over, Greenwald tears up the papers and sweeps up the scraps. They'll have to stay secret for a little bit longer.",0.7025897398329962,0.2974102601670038,0.848626882403345,621,4.5619967793880836,351,5.4729344729344733,0,0,"US & World, National Security, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Particularly online, where we tend to grade things not by the ways in which they succeed, but by the degrees in which they fail to meet our expectations. A new phone doesn’t offer enough features; a watch isn’t a replacement for your cell phone; a movie doesn’t deliver to the same degree that its predecessor did. It’s an easy shorthand that gives us all a common frame of reference and a fight in which to take up arms, but perhaps most importantly — and here’s the dirty not-so-secret — it’s safe.  What can be hard is looking past that cynicism and admitting to actually liking things. Especially the imperfect ones — the ones that require us to look past their deficiencies and glaring weaknesses to see the benefit within, the ones that force us to adjust our perspective and come to grips with the jarring juxtaposition between the way they disappoint us, but still leave us with a feeling of hope and wonder — hell, even childish delight.  Brad Bird’s new movie Tomorrowland comes out this weekend, and it’s a strange, awkward, contrarian mess at times. I’m also in love with it. Directed by Bird (The Incredibles, The Iron Giant) — who co-wrote with Lost’s Damon Lindelof — Tomorrowland has kept things mysterious with its trailers thus far, and I’m largely going to adhere to that. Going too much into the movie’s plot mechanics would rob it of its weird, exploratory tension, but suffice it to say that there’s an idealistic teenaged girl named Casey (Britt Robertson), a grumpy old man called Frank (George Clooney), and a child (Athena, played brilliantly by Raffey Cassidy) trying to bring them both together. There’s also Hugh Laurie’s rather generic bad guy, Nix, and of course Tomorrowland itself. As glimpsed in the trailer above, the film’s Tomorrowland is a wondrous landscape of levitating trains and jet packs. Production designer Scott Chambliss riffs off the style of Disneyland and architect Santiago Calatrava to create a retro-future world that captures the essence of the 1960s space race aesthetic at a glance. Bird’s camera captures it with the wandering, awed gaze of a child — in one particular sequence drifting from incredible sight to incredible sight in the span of a continuous, minutes-long shot. It’s also a world the movie spends remarkably little time in. Tomorrowland is part location, part MacGuffin, but mostly it’s a conceptual stand-in for what the movie is really interested in: hope and optimism.   Or perhaps I should say the lack thereof. The world Casey inhabits is a mirror image of our own, where obsessions with global catastrophe, the defunding of agencies like NASA, and post-apocalyptic entertainment have all aligned to force people into apathetic resignation — with potentially disastrous results. (In one of the film’s Pixar-esque gags, billboards for a movie called ToxiCosmos 3 pop up repeatedly in the background.) The meta-commentary isn’t subtle, and with Tomorrowland, Bird and Lindelof essentially point a finger at every dour superhero movie or YA dystopia, saying These things are helping make the world a lesser place. For anyone tired of the monochrome tonality of so much modern entertainment, it’s a breath of fresh air — though I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out that the more cynical read on that same sentiment is Movies that aren’t happy like Disney films make the world a lesser place. This is a movie based partly on a theme park, after all, and one so well aware of its corporate parentage that it manages to work in several Star Wars references while simultaneously winking at the corporate synergy of it all. But Tomorrowland is so damn earnest in the way it deals with its big-picture ideas that you can’t help but believe Bird and Lindelof mean it, too. If only the movie was as sharp-minded throughout its two-hour runtime as it is with this particular bit of commentary. Tomorrowland is a pastiche, sometimes calling back to the best of Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment, at other moments playing like a live-action cartoon, and toward the end morphing into a generic ticking-clock action flick. The mix is off-putting, preventing the viewer from settling in because you never know which zig the movie’s going to zag. It’s as if Lindelof and Bird just had too many ideas they didn’t want to part with, and at a certain point I was almost certain I would end up disliking Tomorrowland despite its charms. But the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and the movie ends on such an aspirational crescendo — go back to Apple’s ""Think Different"" campaign, and you’ll get the idea — that I couldn’t stop smiling. And I realized, days later, that I was still thinking about the weird, wild optimism that runs through the movie’s veins — while the misfires were steadily fading from memory. We live in a world where the biggest, world-changing ideas come courtesy of massive corporations and eccentric billionaires. Where astronomers have to actually remind people that the simple act of exploration can excite a generation. A world where it’s safer to snark and critique than to take a risk. If the latter’s what you’re into, Tomorrowland will give you plenty of ammunition. It’s messy, confused, and full of strange set-ups and a thinly sketched villain. But it’s also a movie that dares to inspire.

I'm sure dozens of character actors appear time and again in my favorite television shows and movies and I never notice. But I always spot a Brett Gelman guest appearance. The actor and comedian has appeared in a handful of Adult Swim shows, a Harold and Kumar movie, Fresh Off the Boat, Kroll Show, and plenty of sitcoms. His look isn't especially unique, but that face is burnt into my brain because of his 17-minute-long one-man musical about cats. Gelman originally wrote the musical as a half-hour comedy show, but I first saw the routine on HBO's short-lived Funny or Die. The musical, as the title says, is the story of 1,000 cats. Actually, it contains 1,000 stories, and they're spread across 9,000 lives. Gelman spoke about the origins of ""1,000 Cats"" in an interview with Splitsider: Gelman: Yeah, I'd been doing that as a live show at UCB for like eight years. Right out of college in '99, I started writing it, and then I started doing it. Jason [Woliner] came and saw it, and he was like, ""I love this."" And then, a couple years later, Funny Or Die asked Jason what he wanted to do for their HBO show, and Jason said, ""This is one of the things I want to do."" Originally, the show was a half-hour. Andrew Steele at Funny Or Die was the first person who came and saw it and gave it the green light and told Adam McKay and then Adam saw it and gave it the final green light. To give Andrew Steele credit, he's like, ""Well, we've gotta cut it down to 12 minutes."" And then, we made it 17 minutes, and he was like, ""I love it. Don't cut this down at all."" This special and that are the only things that I've been the lead of on TV. It's cool that it's both with Jason. There's similarities to them. They blur the lines between funny and drama in a lot of ways. It's just like committing without irony to the reality of it, even though the reality is completely ridiculous. Both characters are very insane psychotic people. They both have a lot of problems. Splitsider: What did you have to cut out of the half-hour version of ""1000 Cats""? Gelman: You know, I think the version on HBO is better than the live version. If I ever did it again live and wanted to make it longer, I would probably rewrite parts that we ended up cutting out. It also was better because we performed it at The Orpheum in front of a bunch of people who were wearing tuxedos and had been told not to laugh. Jason got on stage and was like, ""Everyone, what you're about to see, this is not funny. It's a very important event."" I don't think they would have thought it was funny anyway. They were just like, ""What the fuck is this?"" Be sure to read the full interview at Splitsider, then wander the site.

It's a crowd-pleasing touch, and it's garnered some of the biggest laughs at the film's premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, but I couldn't help but wonder what my own emotions — particularly Joy, Sadness, and Disgust — had been up to throughout the film's running time. I will admit to having a somewhat fraught relationship with this film going in. Director Pete Docter's last film with them, Up, left me completely cold, which apparently makes me some kind of soulless robot. I particularly found its famously tear-jerking sequence, in which we see the life of an old man and his eventually deceased wife compressed into a few minutes, egregious. I won't deny tearing up during it, but it was in spite of myself. Of course it's sad to watch a sweet old man lose his sweet old wife; never mind that we're barely 10 minutes into the film and know nothing about either character. It's the emotional equivalent of a jump scare in a horror movie, or pinching someone to make them go ""ouch."" People just naturally react to some things; that doesn't mean they're smart or thoughtful or profound.   With Inside Out, Docter — again teamed with Up co-writer Michael Arndt — has switched his focus from the regrets of old age to the sorrows of lost youth, and once again he can't help but push those sentimentality buttons at every turn. The person whose head we spend the majority of the film in is that of Riley, an 11-year-old girl, who has lived a mostly happy, carefree life in Minnesota with her mother and father. In fact, she's frequently referred to as ""our happy girl"" by the latter, to the pride of Joy (Amy Poehler), who is the unofficial captain of the U.S.S. Riley. (We are to assume this is because happy people have the most initiative.) Things take a turn, however, when Riley's father relocates the family to San Francisco for a new job, and Riley must leave behind her friends and her school and start a new life. It's about that time that Joy's control of her charge starts to slip, and Sadness (voiced by The Office's Phyllis Smith, who has many of the film's best moments) begins to go a little rogue in central command, tampering with Riley's ""core memories"" — her first hockey score, goofing around with her parents as a child — and turning them from happy memories to melancholy ones. This invention of the film is pretty brilliant, as Sadness is never depicted as a troublemaker or a sower of sorrow — she just can't help herself, she never knows why she does the things she does. And the conceit — that as we age and life throws more complications at us, our remembrance of things past becomes more emotionally complicated — is simple and profound and inventively conveyed. Through some disaster involving a bundle of core memories and some kind of pneumatic tube too abstract to economically explain here, Joy and Sadness get whisked out of headquarters and dropped far away in Long Term Memory — a kind of labyrinthine library of multicolored units of experience — and must make the long journey back while Fear, Anger, and Disgust take the wheel to disastrous effect. And here's where Inside Out starts to veer into even more wobbly and often literally abstract territory — which will please fans of Up's weirder flights of fancy and lose others. Most of this is engaging enough, and a sequence in Riley's Dream Production center — which of course resembles a studio backlot — was pretty fun. But the central emotional thread through all of this involves a character named Bing Bong, Riley's long-forgotten imaginary friend. Without spoiling much, I will merely say that Bing Bong is the logical successor to Toy Story's forgotten, unloved toys, and is clearly put there only to put our own personal Sadnesses into a chokehold. Much of Docter's intentions in the film are interesting and introspective, but I can't get behind this sort of weepy mourning of childhood innocence he seems determined to return to time and time again. Life is full of enough sadness; now we're supposed to feel guilty about the inanimate and imaginary objects of our childhood? Inside Out is clearly made from the perspective of a parent, and I can't hold that against it — Riley's emotions, especially Joy, are like secondary parents, watching her and rooting for her and playing back her memories with unconditional affection. But I wonder how this film will play for actual children, aka its primary audience, and how much Docter's wildly abstract, candy-colored visual design will delight vs. confound them. Much of it, I suppose, will look familiar — I still remember imagining jelly bean-like workers living in my stomach when I was very young, which were present in almost unsettling verisimilitude in Riley's long-term memory. And there are enough clever references to very concrete, real-world experiences (a jingle for a gum commercial that keeps being summoned for no particular reason, the maintenance workers who unsentimentally clear out unused memories like piano lessons and phone numbers) to keep it from flying off the rails. I hope its real, quite sophisticated lesson — that it's okay to feel things other than happiness sometimes, and that all our emotions help us grow up — comes through all the bouncing marbles and glitter showers and rainbow pony princesses. Not that it matters; for as long as they've been around, Pixar movies are as much for adults as they are for children. And that lesson is one that never hurts to be reminded of at any age. But I would add an important caveat for the adults in the room: it's okay to feel Sadness sometimes, but be wary of those who foist Sadness upon you.",0.5248173461234038,0.4751826538765962,0.16703554234402787,1048,4.7690839694656493,571,6.0893169877408058,0,12,"Culture, Entertainment, Film, Movie Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It featured giant sand worms, hypercomputers, and augmented humans. But for some, it just wasn't sci-fi enough. ""One of the biggest criticisms that we got was that the game didn't go far enough, that there was a lot of potential for it to be even more audacious, more sci-fi, more different from the historical Civ games,"" says co-lead designer David McDonough. The solution was out in the oceans.   Today developer Firaxis is announcing the first major expansion for Beyond Earth, called Rising Tide. And the big selling point is that you can finally venture from the land and start exploring the oceans of alien planets. You can even build new settlements right on top of the water. ""Aquatic gameplay was a great opportunity to push the sci-fi,"" says McDonough, ""and make the game different from its predecessor."" With the oceans comes new aliens to deal with, new resources to harvest, and new naval units to add to your armies. The visual style has also been upgraded with some cool new transparency effects, so that you can see the creatures that lurk beneath the water's surface. ""Aquatic gameplay was a great opportunity to push the sci-fi."" ""It's what we like to think of as a Firaxis-style expansion,"" producer Andrew Frederiksen says of Rising Tide. ""What that means to us is, not only are we adding some additional content, but we're also expanding and redefining some of the core experiences that you would expect from the base game."" That includes additions not necessarily related to the new aquatic theme. The expansion will include four new factions to play as, including one made up of a fabulously wealthy group of Middle Eastern expats, as well as new types of planets to explore (called biomes in the game). The base game included three, and Rising Tide will add another two, including one described as a primordial planet ""rife with volcanic activity and indicative of a chaotic landscape still forming in the new world."" According to McDonough, the majority of the new features were designed based on feedback from players. ""The biggest ideas for this came from the day after the main game was released,"" he says, ""and we really got a dialogue going with our fans."" Those fans will be able to experience the changes for themselves later this year — Rising Tide will be launching on Windows this fall for $29.99.

It can’t go on without Hobbs."" That's not far from the truth. The former WWE star has quickly become one of the best parts of the Fast and Furious franchise since his first appearance in Fast Five. His combination of commanding screen presence and comedic delivery brings some much-appreciated levity to the overwrought series. The latest Furious 7 suffered, in part, due to his limited role.  ""It can’t go on without Hobbs."" In fact, he plays such key part of the series, that there's been rumors of a Hobbs-centered spinoff film, because the endless supply of Fast and Furious films definitely isn't enough. At the same press event, Johnson answered a question regarding a possible spinoff thusly: We all are interested in it. I just had a big conversation with the studio. So we’ll see. I still think for me personally we’ve created a little bit of space for him in 7 and the gauge is set for what the audience will want. That’s my take on it, you know, but a lot of other people have to have input. So that's definitely not a confirmation that it's happening, but it does make the spinoff  much more than a simple rumor. For now, we'll just have to wait and see. In the meantime, Furious 8 is set for an April 14, 2017 release date, and now we know that both Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, at the very least, will return.

Apple's not off the hook, however, with District Judge Rodney Gilstrap ordering a new trial to determine damages after deciding that the jury may have been confused by instructions when calculating the original total. The plaintiff in the lawsuit is a Texas-based company called Smartflash, whose primary business is patent licensing. It's a shell company that makes money by litigating patents. In the original 2013 filing, Smartflash accused Apple of infringing on three of its patents in iTunes and other software. The patents in question pertain to ""data storage and managing access through payment systems."" Smartflash claims that founder Patrick Racz discussed the technologies with someone who would be ultimately hired by Apple. The trial was held at the federal court for the Eastern District of Texas, where juries have an established history of ruling against major tech companies and awarding large sums to plaintiffs suing over patents. Smartflash was initially aiming for even more, seeking $852 million in damages. Despite the smaller amount it was awarded in February, the company was encouraged by the courtroom win and filed another patent suit against Apple shortly thereafter. Apple is appealing the original decision and has aggressively criticized Smartflash in public statements. ""Smartflash makes no products, has no employees, creates no jobs, has no US presence, and is exploiting our patent system to seek royalties for technology Apple invented,"" a spokesperson said in February.

Apple’s own messaging features take front stage on the hardware; the Watch only has one traditional button, which takes you to a list of friends and lets you exchange quick sketches or emoji, get their attention with a nudge, or connect on a more intimate level by sending them your heartbeat. It’s unclear whether any or all of these “digital touch” features will take off, despite their current prominence. Of the “HBD” messages I got last week, the hand-sketched ones on my wrist felt more personal than those on my Facebook wall, at least. But the Apple Watch’s potential as a way to communicate doesn’t have to hinge on Apple’s own ideas — like the iPhone before it, the Watch is a software platform where developers are hoping to strike gold with the next hot social app. It’s a new device with new ways to interact, and there are obvious challenges to overcome, like the small screen, limited battery, and lack of keyboard. And if what happened with the iPhone is any indication, you might want to look to Asia first. Messaging is the most important function on your smartphone, and Asian apps like Line in Japan, WeChat in China, and Kakao Talk in South Korea have set the pace for Silicon Valley. Facebook Messenger and Yo have cribbed their growth strategy from these apps, while Path just sold itself to Kakao’s parent company after spending years aping its features. These apps were all on the Apple Watch at launch — Apple even highlighted WeChat during its May event — and they turn out to be a great fit. It’s all about stickers. Most Western users will have come across stickers, which are like oversized emoji with more personality, through Facebook Messenger. But they’re a far more prominent and essential feature in the East. Stickers are a quick, contextual, often hilarious way to embellish conversations, which turns out to be perfect for the Apple Watch. Line, Kakao Talk, and WeChat all have very similar Watch apps that let you reply to messages with stickers right from the wrist; if you’re used to stickers, they’re often all you need. ""When they first came out no one really knew whether [the sticker characters] were boys or girls or even what kind of animals or people these things were,"" Line CEO Takeshi Idezawa (above) told me last year. ""But that fluidity lent them the ability to let our users express their emotions more easily by not tying it down to one thing."" Line in particular has done an incredible job of making its users identify with its own stickers; Brown the bear and Cony the bunny are Hello Kitty-style phenomena in Japan and beyond, with extravagant merchandise stores popping up in cities like Bangkok and even New York. Stickers are a major reason that Asian chat apps are so engaging, and that’s why they work so well on the wrist — it’s easier to convey delight with a deranged bunny grin than a clumsy sketch using Apple’s digital touch. There are a couple of interface hiccups at present. Line, for example, automatically suggests relevant stickers when you type on a phone keyboard, which makes it much easier to find the one you want, whereas Watch apps make you scroll through a limited selection. But overall, it almost feels like stickers were made for the Watch. ""It’s a new device, and its potential has not yet been discovered,"" a Kakao spokesperson tells The Verge. ""But the Watch boasts higher mobility and accessibility than mobile devices, and we believe these characteristics will bring changes to communication and conversation just as changes came with the introduction of smartphones."" Kakao says it was an intentional decision to keep its Watch app light with only the most frequently used stickers from the phone, and will continue to build out features over time. While these chat apps are finding ways to extend themselves onto the Apple Watch, other developers are creating apps where the Watch is the primary platform. One of the more ambitious to date is WatchMe Messenger, developed by a small Tokyo startup called Pocket Supernova; it pushes right up at the boundaries of what’s currently possible with Apple Watch apps by offering a rudimentary form of video chat. You shoot a 3-second clip with your phone and type in a brief caption, then WatchMe recognizes your words and adds related graphics to the footage before compressing it all into a jerky, colorful GIF made just for the wrist. ""When we saw the watch for the first time at the Apple event, we thought what would be best is a short notification that’s visually rich,"" says CEO Oscar Noriega, who says he was inspired by the lo-fi fun of Nintendo’s Game Boy Camera. ""We imagined that if that notification had motion and additional information, and was visual, it’d be way richer than plain text with a logo from an app."" The obvious issue here is that communication is asymmetrical — one person uses their phone to send a message, then the other receives it on their Watch, then has to dig out their own phone if they want to reply with a video of their own (though they can reply with voice or basic emoji). But WatchMe messages are definitely fun to receive, and Noriega isn’t concerned about the lack of back-and-forth. ""It was never intended to be a super deep product. You can’t have a deep conversation about space or life on Mars or anything like that. It may seem like we designed it as a one-way experience, but in reality users can do what they want [depending on the situation]."" One thoughtful feature is that the sender gets a notification when their video has been viewed, which can often be enough of a ""reply"" in itself. Noriega gave the example of showing an en route friend where you’re sitting in a restaurant, which is actually what I sent to him when I arrived early for our interview in a cafe. Dingbel is another quirky Japanese messaging app, created by Keisuke Kamijo, a producer at mobile gaming company and Nintendo partner DeNA. Kamijo describes it as a ""minimal communication tool,"" and the app itself is incredibly simple — you just tap to send one or two ""dings"" to a Watch-wearing Facebook friend, much like you can with Apple’s own built-in messaging features. But Dingbel is interesting because the context for each message lives outside the app itself. One ding is supposed to mean ""yes / positive / good"" while two dings means ""no / negative / bad"", so you can send ultra-quick messages on the move that can be meaningful based on the situation.  ""We believe that communication among wearables will be increasingly high-context,"" says Kamijo. ""Other than 'ding' and 'ding-ding,' you can also see the sender, the time, and the distance, which can be just enough information to get what it means. For example, if you are supposed to meet up with a friend at 6PM but are running late, a 'Ding' from your friend 500 meters away obviously means ‘I’m here. Where are you?’"" There’s no reason why you couldn’t do almost the same thing with the Apple Watch’s built-in software, and DeNA has its work cut out convincing people to download and use an app with little obvious extra functionality. But by defining and codifying how abstract notifications are ascribed meaning in the real world, Dingbel could be useful because everyone with the app will share an understanding of how to use it. But for all the efforts of developers, there’s only so much they’ve been able to do right now to make compelling software. Apple Watch apps have very limited functionality right now because of WatchKit, the cut-down SDK developers use — WatchKit apps don’t run on the Watch itself; they’re subsets of iPhone apps, and all the processing happens on the phone while data is sent across to the Watch. This is effective for reducing strain on the Watch’s battery, but means that loading apps is often maddeningly slow to the point where the Watch’s quick-look advantage is rendered irrelevant. Things are about to get better, though; native apps that run on the Watch itself are coming. Last month at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple showed off the first details of watchOS 2.0 and WatchKit 2.0, which should be a huge boon to developers. Apps will be able to use hardware features like the Watch’s sensors and digital crown, and won’t have to rely so much on the iPhone. ""People need to understand that the changes announced at WWDC are really important and will have an impact on the kind and quality of apps overall,"" says Noriega, who is understandably excited about the ability to play actual video files as well as make use of the Watch’s sensors. ""Developers can provide better experiences with native apps, and this is the most important change — without getting into the technical details, what really matters is that for users this just means better experiences, faster experiences, and smoother flows."" We’ll have to wait and see just how developers end up using the Watch hardware. But after a couple of months wearing the Watch myself, I’m convinced that it holds great — yet untapped — potential as a messaging device, and that the things that tend to work best on the Watch are unlike anything we’ve seen before. Who knows? The next Snapchat might work best on the wrist.",0.6501747253353595,0.34982527466464053,0.16791433001828016,1611,4.8392302917442578,742,6.2533692722371965,0,16,"Apple, Apps, Tech, Report",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Today the company is announcing family plans for both its Premium and HiFi (lossless) streaming tiers. But whereas Apple Music's family plan comes at a flat rate, Tidal is charging customers money for each new account registered underneath the primary user. The way it works is this: for each new person tied to your account, you pay half of the original subscription cost. So if you're on Tidal Premium, adding extra members of your family will cost $4.99 per person every month, in addition to your main $9.99 fee. Price-wise, this is more or less an exact clone of existing family plans from Spotify and Rdio — but Spotify has signaled it plans to lower pricing soon since Apple Music is already undercutting everyone. Apple's pricing is more straightforward, and soon Spotify will be cheaper If you're on Tidal High Fidelity, the costs are significantly higher. Tidal's lossless streaming tier, which to be clear is something rivals don't even offer, costs $19.99 per month. And for each new person added to your family plan, it's $9.99. That could get very expensive in a hurry. You can add up to four accounts to a family plan, and if you do that with Tidal HiFi, you'll be paying around $60 each month for everyone in your family to stream lossless audio. Many people can't tell any difference between Tidal Premium's 320kbps AACs and CD-quality FLAC files using today's popular smartphones and headphones, so the Premium tier is definitely the more sensible option. But even then, the version regular consumers should get costs more than Apple Music's $15 per month family plan, which allows six people to stream music versus the five that Tidal permits. And while Tidal can say it's charging the same as Spotify right now, we know that won't be lasting long. It's good to see Tidal offering the option of simplifying payments for families, but Apple (and even Rhapsody, for that matter) have shown that it's possible to make these plans way more straightforward. It's hard to see this really moving the needle much in Tidal's favor, so the company will need to keep leaning on exclusives and its famous lineup of overseers to do that.",0.6643562135729083,0.3356437864270917,0.17868196091678115,399,4.8746867167919801,236,5.5338983050847457,1,0,"Apps, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Their cramped keyboards, dull displays, and feeble processors couldn’t detract from their eminent usefulness as fast note takers and convenient web browsers on the move. Sony’s Xperia tablets — and tablets in general — have the opposite problem: they’re blessed with all the advantages of high design and precise engineering, but none of the purpose of the humble netbook. This year, Sony is addressing that issue by pairing its latest Xperia Z4 Tablet with a keyboard dock and essentially creating the netbook of the future. It’s a 10-inch ultraportable machine that runs Microsoft Office and promises long battery life, and it has the potential to serve as Android’s answer to Apple’s MacBook and Microsoft’s Surface computers. Can the addition of a keyboard give real meaning to the existence of yet another splendidly thin and powerful Android tablet? In spite of its name inflation, the Xperia Z4 Tablet is actually the successor to last year’s Xperia Z2 Tablet, and very little has changed in the way it looks and feels. This is still one of the best-engineered electronic devices on the market, feeling featherweight and durable at the same time. That’s is an important and powerful combination, as it allows you to toss the tablet around like a literal notebook, not having to worry about the added fragility of it being a piece of high-tech equipment. Waterproof once again, the Z4 Tablet has evolved to now also include a capless USB port, removing the annoying flappy cover of its predecessor. Sony has also taken out its engineering razor and somehow found a few spare millimeters and grams to shave off the tablet’s weight and thickness. In response to user feedback bemoaning the vastness of the bezels around the screen, Sony has shrunken those down as well. Such a tale of small incremental improvements is characteristic of Sony’s Xperia development history, and it’s how we’ve arrived at excellent devices like the Xperia Z3 and Z4 smartphones and the present Z4 Tablet. I look all around the device, investigate every edge and surface for imperfection, and find none. But I also don’t find anything (other than the more convenient USB port) that I couldn’t get from last year’s model. Sony will tell you that the Z4 Tablet’s biggest upgrades are contained within, with a new 2560 x 1600 display stepping up the resolution from 1920 x 1200, and the Snapdragon 810 processor replacing the earlier 801. Good luck trying to identify where those changes make a difference, though, as I sure couldn’t. As much of a believer as I am in high-resolution displays, Sony’s upgrade here is from high to very high, and, like the mountaintops of Everest obscured by cloud cover, I just can’t see the difference. Performance is similarly unremarkable: this is a fast and responsive Android device, but that’s no longer a novelty like it once was. The new processor and higher-res screen may, in fact, have led to something of a downgrade as I found myself disappointed by the Z4 Tablet’s battery life. The actual battery is no smaller (6,000mAh) than in the Xperia Z2 Tablet, but I’m having to recharge the newer device more often. I have to top up the Z4’s charge every couple of days, whether I use it or not. That’s somewhat unusual for tablets, which can last for multiple days when left idling. The Z4 Tablet still has decent battery life, but it’s not as impressive as, say, Google’s Nexus 9 or Apple’s latest iPads. The keyboard dock doesn’t help matters, either, as it has a tiny power reserve just to keep its Bluetooth radio going and doesn’t give the Z4 Tablet any extra juice. As a tablet, the Z4 delivers exactly what the Z2 Tablet did last year: outstanding engineering, waterproof durability, minimalist design, and high specs and performance. It is an excellent ambassador for Android, lacking almost nothing in the hardware department. It’s as thin as the iPad Air 2 (a scarcely believable 6.1mm that barely accommodates the headphone jack), and I’d even go so far as to say I prefer its look and feel over Apple’s alternative. I would certainly feel more confident investing in this hardier, waterproof device. But, of course, it’s not just about the hardware. Apple’s app ecosystem remains a considerable advantage in any tablet comparison, though Android apps are gradually improving. The past year has seen the launch of titles like Hearthstone and Vainglory, which occupy an intriguing space between PC and mobile gaming: they’re better suited to a larger screen size yet still maintain a mobile-friendly experience. At the same time, more utilitarian apps like the BBC iPlayer Radio are also coming out with tablet-tailored versions for Android. Small steps in the right direction. Sony augments the gaming appeal of the Z4 Tablet with the inclusion of PS4 Remote Play. Connect a DualShock controller to the tablet via Bluetooth, boot up your PlayStation 4, and stream the games directly to your Z4 Tablet. I don’t have a PS4 available to test this out with, but it’s a fine feature to have and it would make good use of the tablet’s attractive, high-resolution display and stereo front-facing speakers. Sony also makes a couple of modifications to the Android interface to make its keyboard dock more useful, which offer a good segue into discussing how this device fares in its secondary role as a hybrid laptop. The artfully titled BKB50 Bluetooth Keyboard is literally just that: a keyboard. There are no additional ports or extra battery for the tablet, which just slots into a receptacle at the top of the dock and connects wirelessly. Once the two are tethered up, you are presented with a small task bar and something akin to a Windows Start menu at the bottom left of the screen. Both are really quite useful, and I found myself customizing the task bar with my most-used apps and using it as my primary mode for switching between tasks. It’s almost worth having the task bar as a default option even without the keyboard — it’s that handy. Unfortunately, Sony’s small UI tweaks are where the good news about this keyboard dock ends. The dock itself is an unqualified disaster of bad design. When I have it on my lap, the whole thing shakes back and forth with the force of my typing. The right Shift key and the arrow buttons are so desperately tiny that I keep hitting the Android multitasking button by mistake. I’ve lost count of the number of times I was hunting for the Backspace and landed on the power button. And even though search is a pretty fundamental and common operation when using an Android device, the keyboard shortcut for it here is an absurd two-key combination that spans the entire keyboard. Never have I seen so many buttons squished together into so unhelpful an arrangement. I’d be willing to forgive the arcane keyboard layout if the typing experience was satisfying enough, but it isn’t. The keys are tiny and make an unpleasant clacking sound, which combines with the lack of balance of the keyboard-tablet combo to drive me to either try voice input or give up and switch to my real laptop. Persisting through these misgivings, as a good reviewer must, I kept typing on the BKB50 until I developed a faint ache just above my right wrist. The narrow keyboard width forces the typist’s hands into an unnatural position and such pains are, unfortunately, to be expected. Without a backlight or a Caps Lock indicator, Sony’s keyboard dock limits its usefulness even further. The touchpad might have been a redeeming feature, but it follows the same trajectory into a pit of despair as the rest of the dock. Two-finger scrolling is buggy, regularly freezing up or suddenly jumping in the opposite direction, whether used in Chrome or Google Docs. There’s also a vexing delay of more than a second between me typing anything and being able to use the touchpad — it’s probably Sony’s palm rejection at work, but it makes it so slow to make adjustments with the touchpad that I just don’t bother using it. Yet again, I find myself deeply frustrated by Sony’s failure to live up to its own expectations and produce a cohesive product. The company’s ideas are not bad: there is definitely a class of more conservative mobile PC users that demands a real physical keyboard and Microsoft Office compatibility. Such people can be very adequately served by the Surface Pro 3, but they don’t strictly need a Windows PC. An Android tablet — especially one preloaded with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint as the Z4 is — can fulfill most of their needs, while costing and weighing less. If I was heading off to university this fall, I’d definitely consider getting a super thin device that can be both my YouTube video player and my modernist take on the netbook for taking lecture notes. Sony's premise is sound. Its execution isn’t. Sony’s Xperia Z4 Tablet could and should have been so much more than just another Android tablet. This is the company that once set the standard for chiclet keyboards with its VAIO laptops and previewed our future with the exceedingly thin VAIO X. Making an Android tablet that can effortlessly morph into an Office-running laptop should be in Sony’s DNA already. Just dust off some of those old blueprints and adapt them to the modern times. Without a functional and reliable keyboard dock, the Xperia Z4 Tablet shrinks down to the anonymity of being a good device in a sea of good devices. Sure, it makes the Nexus 9 feel fat and heavy by comparison, but Google’s tablet also costs a lot less. More than anything, I have to look back at the Xperia Z2 Tablet from last year — which has the same list of advantages like LTE, thin and waterproof design, and high-resolution display — and ask what Sony has done to improve on is own prior best effort. The display and speakers are still good, the camera is still mediocre, and any improvements on the software front are mostly down to Android’s (still slow) maturation as a tablet platform. Practical differences between the two devices begin and end with the new USB port — and I refuse to get excited about a port that isn’t USB-C. Not even Apple can get away with reissuing the same iPad every year without shrinking sales. Selling Android tablets is even harder. This is why I found Sony’s idea of fashioning out an Android netbook so refreshing. Our infatuation with netbooks may have subsided many years ago, but our need for quick and easy typing and note taking hasn’t dissipated. There’s a massive opportunity to revive those cramped, awkward little machines of yesteryear with the help of modern technology and turn them into slick, versatile productivity hubs. Apple’s 2015 MacBook is one attempt at creating an evolved version of the netbook, and Sony’s Xperia Z4 Tablet with its BKB50 keyboard offers another. The big difference is that the MacBook is a flawed representation of a future that is yet to come, whereas Sony’s hybrid offering is just flawed.",0.5122759173858977,0.4877240826141023,0.16808281395515445,1892,4.9138477801268499,882,6.4092970521541952,0,14,"Google, Mobile, Tech, Review",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""""We would miss out on a major opportunity to reduce smoke-related deaths.For the WHO to suggest that e-cigarettes are as risky as other tobacco products would send an erroneous and bleak message to the millions of current e-cigarette users who have used them to quit smoking,"" Robert West, a University College London researcher and a signatory of the letter, says in a statement. ""It would discourage smokers from trying them and we would miss out on a major opportunity to reduce smoke-related deaths globally."" The researchers believe that the 1.3 billion people worldwide who current smoke would do far less harm to their health by using e-cigarettes or other vaporizers, which deliver nicotine but don't include tobacco. The jury is still out on the health effects of these cigarette alternatives, so for now the researchers just say that the WHO should ensure that it bases its policy on sound data. This October, the WHO will meet to discuss the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and leaked documents suggest that regulations for e-cigarettes are on the agenda. Were e-cigarette regulations to be included in a future version of the treaty, all of its parties — currently 178 countries — would be required to work toward upholding its goals. Notably, the United States has signed the treaty but not ratified it. It's a United Nations' goal to reduce the prevalence of smoking, so the researchers argue that the WHO would actually be working against its parent organization's goal by pushing back against e-cigarettes. It agrees that any use of nicotine is a negative, but it says e-cigarettes serve as a much better option. ""Even though most of us would prefer people to quit smoking and using nicotine altogether,"" the researchers write, ""experience suggests that many smokers cannot or choose not to give up nicotine and will continue to smoke if there is no safer alternative available that is acceptable to them."" The researchers come from a variety of institutions, but include people who work at universities, drug study centers, and general medical associations — some even previously working with the WHO itself.

Most patients weren't vaccinated for religious, philosophical, or personal objectionsThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pins the striking rise in measles cases on unvaccinated people, who make up at least 69 percent of the reported cases. (In 20 percent of cases, the person's vaccination status was unknown. In only 10 percent of cases was the person actually known to be vaccinated.) Some of the unvaccinated people were too young to receive vaccination or said that they had missed opportunities to be vaccinated. But the vast majority, 85 percent, had refrained from vaccination because of religious, philosophical, or personal objections. ""The current increase in measles cases is being driven by unvaccinated people, primarily US residents, who got measles in other countries, brought the virus back to the United States and spread to others in communities where many people are not vaccinated,"" assistant surgeon general Anne Schuchat says in a statement. Though measles is reaching a relative peak in the US, it's still far lower in the United States than elsewhere across the globe. There's estimated to be around 20 million annual measles cases worldwide and about 122,000 deaths stemming from it. Still, the rise in the United States is sharp. The CDC reported that measles cases had spiked in 2013 too, and 2013 saw only 175 confirmed cases in total by early December.

In this case, the researchers pointed an infrared laser at a hole drilled into a rat's tooth and found that it encouraged dentin — the material that makes up a tooth's core — to grow back more than it otherwise would have.

Japan adopted the plan in September of last year, and the AFP reports that its nuclear regulator has now approved it, with construction scheduled to start next month.   Experts are still questioning whether an ice wall will actually workThe project intends to freeze the ground around four reactors, as well as other related buildings, at Fukushima down to a depth of nearly 100 feet. In total, the frozen wall of earth will stretch for nearly nine-tenths of a mile and is meant to reach temperatures of minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 degrees Celsius). A series of pipes carrying coolant will be used to freeze the land. Beyond preventing water from escaping the area, the AFP reports that the hope is that it will also prevent water from flowing into the plant from nearby hillsides. Construction is expected to finish in March of 2015 and cost about 32 billion yen ($314 million). The AFP reports that some aspects of the plan may still be subject to approval by Fukushima plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO). And even after construction begins, there are likely to be lasting concerns. While walls of frozen earth have reportedly been used in the past for tunnels and subways, they've never been used for a purpose like Fukushima's and not for the length of time that it'll take — potentially several decades — for the plant to be decommissioned. Other concerns over the expensive plan were raised on Friday, before its approval today, at a meeting with Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority. Both government officials and experts expressed questions over the plan's efficacy, according to the Associated Press, asking whether it will actually be able to prevent water contamination over the long term and if it might cause any problems for the area in doing so. Ultimately, those concerns were't enough to hold the plan back, but it'll be necessary to watch its progress to see if the wall's goals are actually fulfilled. TEPCO began one other large initiative to prevent the growth of contaminated water last week, beginning to release water that was deemed to be safe out into the Pacific Ocean, according to Reuters. The move was controversial due to the presence of some contamination, however minimal, but with more nearby water reportedly entering the facilities and mixing with radioactive contaminants on a daily basis, it's become increasingly necessary that the plan prevent its entrance and facilitate its safe removal. TEPCO reportedly plans to divert 100 metric tons of clean groundwater each day into the ocean.

In the study, researchers surveyed over 9,000 opioid-dependent patients in 150 drug treatment centers across the US. Of those patients, about 2,800 reported heroin use. ""Most people tend to be prescription drug users first and then graduate to heroin,"" Cicero says. Cost and accessibility are the main reasons people try heroin in the first place, he says, but the drug's strength causes many to stick with it. ""The additive properties of heroin are manifold greater than prescription drugs,"" he says. ""It gets into the brain much more quickly than other opiates"" and causes ""a rush"" that is far stronger than that of prescription pills. the migration of heroin from inner cities to the suburbs. The study also found that 90 percent of people who started using heroin in the past decade are white, and most of them are in their late 20s. But Cicero cautions that this doesn't mean heroin has become less popular among young men of color in urban centers. ""That number has probably increased too,"" Cicero says. The difference is that heroin has moved into suburbia as well. In fact, 75 percent of the survey's respondents who had taken heroin did so while living in small cities or non-urban areas. ""We suddenly saw an explosion of heroin use in areas that were previously not interested in the drug,"" Cicero says, ""the biggest development being the migration of heroin from inner cities to the suburbs and rural areas."" ""The unfortunate part is the graduation from the relative safety of pills to the unsafe properties of heroin is that the risk of overdose becomes enormous,"" Cicero says. The purity of the drug, or lack thereof, is an important factor in heroin-related deaths: other ingredients often include things like talcum powder, and because the drug isn't sterile, people who use it come into contact with a plethora of bacterial contaminations that can cause infections. And the risk of HIV and hepatitis C infection that accompanies sharing needles continues to pose a threat. That's why a more widespread geographic distribution of heroin use is extremely worrisome, Cicero says, adding that the US government's skewed view of how the illegal drug trade operates might be the reason it persists today. ""We are trying to cut down on the amount of heroin available, but we aren't really addressing the problem,"" he says. ""We need to focus a lot more on why people find these drugs so attractive [or] we aren't going to be solving the abuse problem at all.""",0.6305874508921704,0.3694125491078296,0.8612119036464897,596,4.9714765100671139,336,5.9553571428571432,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's higher than what US customers pay, but nowhere near the rates luxury cars usually demand in China. ""We care about doing the right thing for our customers – no matter where they live,"" reads a Tesla blog post announcing the MSRP. Expensive, but cheaper than other cars in its class Instead of offering numerous battery pack sizes for the Model S as it does in the US, Tesla is releasing only the large-battery version (rated at 85 kWh) in China. Here, that option normally tacks an extra $10,000 onto the car's $69,900 starting price, which itself includes a sizable federal tax credit. Tesla says ""unavoidable taxes, customs duties and transportation costs"" also contribute to the higher cost. The automaker's rivals typically price their cars much higher when they make the journey to China. But Tesla wants to make sure Chinese shoppers don't make a direct link between price and quality. ""We know that our competitors will try to convince Chinese consumers that our relatively lower price tag means the Model S is a lesser car, when the real reason their car costs more is that they make double the profit per car in China compared to the United States or Europe,"" the company says.

Most artists make the bulk of their earnings off things like touring and merchandise. But Moby, who has been making electronic music since the '80s, has a slightly different approach. He’s been giving his tracks away to fans on BitTorrent, a service well-known for piracy, and distributing the raw song files to other musicians to remix using a new service called Blend.io. ""The digital present we live in, you can’t control things, can’t lock them down,"" Moby told The Verge. ""The best way to make a living as musician, I find, is to set this stuff free and let the love come back to you.""  ""As for the music, I think of it like a hive mind.""Moby put a package of four songs, three videos, and the chunks of instrumentation to be remixed (called stems) from his new album Innocents into what’s known as a BitTorrent bundle. The bundle was free but it required an email address, linking out to iTunes where fans could buy the rest of the album. It’s a spin on the freemium model that has become so popular among apps: give something away in order to collect customer data and up-sell the rest. His bundle has been downloaded 8.9 million times, making Moby the most downloaded artist on BitTorrent in 2013. That includes bundles from other artists and also puts him ahead of some of the biggest musicians in the world today, names like Rhianna, Justin Timberlake, and Kanye West, who topped out at 5.7 million downloads according to BitTorrent. ""The predictable trajectories of putting out a record and going on tour are gone,"" says Moby. ""It drives record label executives crazy, but personally, I find the chaos kind of exciting."" ""It drives record label executives crazy, but personally I find the chaos kind of exciting."" Today Moby is releasing his newest single ""Almost Home"" on Blend.io, a startup backed by Betaworks, the same New York incubator behind Digg’s relaunch. Anyone can download the song — not just as a music file to listen to, but as raw source code in formats that work with professional music software programs like Ableton Live, ProTools and GarageBand. This makes it far easier for anyone to remix or reuse the song, since they can change the music at its most molecular level.  Blend.io has been compared to Github, the wildly popular service for computer programmers that allows anyone to share their code so that others can make changes to it without disrupting the original. Often in open source software projects, if someone suggests an improvement that works, the creator can use Github to easily push those changes to the source code. ""As for the music, I think of it like a hive mind,"" says Moby. ""We’re moving to an age that is less proprietary, more collective and communal. I like some of the ideas I come up, but my feeling is the next track or next album will always be better with more people and more ideas in the mix."" Because he’s independent, Moby can set his own rules for how his music is used. Artists who use tracks from Blend.io aren’t require to pay any fees and can even sell their reworked versions as their own. It’s a brave new world that likely won’t work for everyone, but it gives Moby a powerful platform for spreading his art — something he believes leads to long-term commercial success.

First, ordering and canceling dozens of rides wastes drivers' time and it makes it harder for legitimate customers to get a car.

The competing service on the other end of this incident is called Gett, and it started operations in New York just this past fall. Gett CEO Jing Herman tells TechCrunch that in some cases the Uber employees waited to cancel until the driver had almost reached the pickup location.

Reports say the staffers involved in the recruitment effort include the company's New York manager, Josh Mohrer, who reportedly ordered and canceled over 20 rides in a two-week period.

The company's press release doesn't include many other details, such as how much Qualcomm paid for the patents, but does say the intellectual property includes ""fundamental mobile operating system techniques."" Qualcomm writes that the aquisition ""will enable the company to offer even more value to current and future licensees."" Something of a homecoming For Qualcomm, some of these ideas will finally be coming home. Qualcomm developed one of the very first PalmOS smartphones in 1999, the PDQ 800, after failing to convince Apple to put a cellular radio into the Apple Newton PDA. The PDQ 800 later morphed into the Kyocera QCP-6035 at retail, and both predated the far more famous Treo line of smartphones. The patents are also following one of Palm's biggest names over to Qualcomm: former Palm CEO Jon Rubenstein, who joined Qualcomm's board of directors last year. It's not clear what, if anything, this might mean for LG's line of new webOS televisions, which use HP / Palm patents as well. While LG bought the rights to webOS from HP in February of last year, it didn't acquire patents in the deal. IPAQ were a line of PDAs that ran Windows Mobile. They were originally developed by Compaq, before HP and Compaq merged in 2002. HP purchased Bitfone in 2006, which built mobile device management software. The press release also doesn't mention whether HP will retain a license to these patents. HP's consumer hardware business has faded since the death of Palm, but it appears the company still intends to build smartphones for certain markets. The company recently announced the HP Slate6 and Slate7 VoiceTabs for India, some sixteen months after CEO Meg Whitman said that smartphones would still be an important business for the company. What will Qualcomm do? What will Qualcomm do with the patents? Perhaps, like the PDQ 800, the company could produce a phone of its own — but more likely the company will simply add them to its treasure trove of intellectual property to extract licensing fees and broker deals from other mobile technology firms. It's a little-known fact that Qualcomm makes more of its money from licensing out its technology than from the chips it sells, although the intellectual property can also help it negotiate chip deals. While the company did recently build a piece of hardware, the Qualcomm Toq smartwatch, it's little more than a showcase for technologies like Qualcomm's Mirasol color e-paper display and WiPower wireless charging. The company would generally prefer that others build consumer hardware — which might be why we saw a Qualcomm Toq screen the last time we visited the Pebble offices. Update: ""This does not change our strategy with respect to mobile, and we will retain a license to these patents,"" an HP spokesman tells The Verge.

While the company says that it hasn't yet confirmed an actual breach, cyber security expert Brian Krebs — who has been closely monitoring the Target and Neiman Marcus attacks — says that Michaels does have reason to believe that data theft might have occurred. According to his sources, four different financial institutions traced hundreds of fradulent purchases back to cards that had been used at Michaels stores. Krebs also writes that one fraud analyst in particular said fraudulent activity had also been seen around Aaron Brothers, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Michaels with 130 stores across the country.

While we don't have confirmation of the Michaels breach or an idea of its scope — the Target breach affected up to 70 million customers' personal data, while the Neiman Marcus attack might have been a smaller 1.1 million payment cards — the company appears to be taking a better safe than sorry approach.

After months of enduring public criticism, President Park Geun-Hye announced a crackdown on any messages deemed as insulting to her or generally rumor-mongering — including private messages sent through Kakao Talk, a Korean messaging app akin to WhatsApp or iMessage. Prosecutors began actively monitoring the service for violations, promising punishment for anyone spreading inappropriate content. 1.5 million South Koreans have signed up for Telegram in the past seven days In response to the crackdown, South Koreans have voted with their feet, heading en masse to encrypted chat programs hosted outside the country, particularly an app called Telegram known for its encryption features. Based in Germany, Telegram reports roughly 1.5 million new South Korean users have signed up in the past seven days, giving the app more than 50 million users worldwide. Telegram's Markus Ra says it's not the only country where government controls have made Telegram an attractive option. ""People frequently come to Telegram looking for extra security — some of them from countries with censorship issues,"" Ra says. ""What really makes us happy is that the users stay when the privacy scandals have died away."" Telegram offers an option for ""secret chats"" that use end-to-end encryption, which means that the company facilitates key exchange but doesn't hold the keys itself and can't decrypt any of the messages. Created by Russian-born entrepreneur Pavel Durov, the app’s offshore location makes legal compulsion much more difficult for South Korean prosecutors. Telegram’s South Korean user base is still just a fraction of Kakao's 35 million users — the vast majority of cell-phone owners in South Korea — but the rapid growth shows how much privacy features can pay off in the face of high-profile censorship. Kakao Talk has struggled to provide the same privacy promises. Since the crackdown was announced, the company has faced rumors that prosecutors are reading chats in real-time, even though the company insists such a setup would be technically impossible. On Thursday, the company announced it would curtail its storage practices, only keeping messages for three days after they're sent, rather than a full week. Still, since Kakao is based in Korea, it can only push back so far. The company is obligated to comply with court orders under South Korean law, turning over messaging data as prosecutors demand it. But while companies compete for user privacy, government pushback isn't unique to South Korea. When Apple took a step towards Telegram-esque end-to-end encryption last month, the FBI pushed back immediately, claiming the features would aid criminals and hinder legitimate warrants. Apple’s supporters responded simply that, after Snowden, the company was giving its users what it wanted. After Telegram’s sudden rise, it’s a more convincing argument than ever.

It can produce an aluminum lower receiver of an AR-15 rifle — the civilian version of the military's M-16 assault rifle — in a couple of hours. The lower receiver, which connects the stock, barrel, magazine, and other parts of the gun together, is the component that is legally considered to be a firearm under US law — and its sale is highly regulated. The Ghost Gunner is programmed to take a partially-complete lower receiver, known as an ""80 percent lower,"" and automatically mill it into a functioning part. From there, all you have to do is buy the other widely-available components online and assemble the rifle. As Wilson explains on the product's website, ""on day one, Ghost Gunner can help you legally manufacture unserialized firearms in the comfort of your own home."" ""Legally manufacture unserialized firearms in the comfort of your own home.""  Pre-orders for the Ghost Gunner started this week at prices ranging from $999 to $1,299, and Cody Wilson's organization, Defense Distributed, sold out its original run of 175 units in just a day.

And gun enthusiasts have legally manufactured AR-15 rifles and other weapons at home using the same components for years — this just streamlines the process. The Ghost Gunner, then, like the 3D-printed ""Liberator"" handgun before it, is more of a political statement than anything else.

By growing slowly and staying one step ahead of anti-virus software, the group was able to go undetected for years — until a lapse in its own security allowed a Proofpoint security researcher named Wayne Huang to get a look at the organization from the inside. Huang released a report on his findings this morning, providing a rare look at the full anatomy of a malware operation, from the first security break to the fraud tactics that provide them a payoff. It's not a particularly novel or sophisticated scheme — by botnet standards, half a million is the lower end of the big leagues — but it provides a new window into the intricate tactics these groups use to stay hidden. And for anyone who's seen strange behavior from a website or console, it's a reminder that real infections are often harder to find than you think. ""They rarely do mass injections. They don't do huge campaigns, so they're not on people's radar,"" Huang says. ""But once they're in, they build a really powerful backdoor.""  The attack chain, as described by Huang The scammers' first step was buying passwords on the dark web, paying for data from an earlier breach. That gave them a foothold in the first batch of sites, where the group could install its custom shell, giving them superadmin access to anything on the site, while allowing the site's owners to update the site as usual. When the system worked, the site owners never knew the difference. They still had admin access, and there was no obvious sign that another more powerful admin had been added. While the site owners kept posting as usual, the attackers would use the new backdoor to infect the site’s readers, injecting bursts of malware into the site’s code. From there the attackers would monitor keystrokes for bank login information, to be used in outright fraud, and sell access to their network of hijacked computers for anyone who wanted to disguise their web traffic by routing through a stranger’s internet connection. The group was always one step ahead of antivirus updates Most of the infected sites were running regular antivirus scans, but the attackers were careful only to use exploits that wouldn't set off any alarms. Before they uploaded any code, they would check it against the Scan4U database, which collects data from dozens of antivirus companies. If the database recognized the group's exploit, they would change the code until it slipped past unnoticed, ensuring they were always one step ahead of antivirus updates. They also took measures to throw researchers like Huang off the trail. If a site visitor looked like an automated malware scanner, a traffic distribution system would isolate the visitor and route them to a clean version of the site, suggesting nothing was amiss. The system also kept a list of IP addresses used by security-research firms, and made sure any traffic from those addresses also went to the clean site. As a result, many site owners confronted by Huang refused to believe they were infected at all. The antivirus scan would come back empty, and most independent researchers would see a completely clean site. But while the hacker's security protections were good, they weren't perfect. Huang's breakthrough came when he found the web address for the attackers' control panel. They hadn't thought to password-protect the controls, so once Huang located it, he got an inside view of everything the group was doing, including the counter-measures they'd used to throw other researchers off the trail. Eventually, the group added a password to keep Huang out, but by then it was too late.  A screenshot of the attacker's control panel. Once the attackers began targeting individual users, they relied heavily on pre-purchased exploit kits, starting with the popular Blackhole kit and moving on to more recent kits like Sweet Orange and Phoenix. They used an array of vulnerabilities — targeting PDF plugins, Java, Flash and Internet Explorer depending on a user’s unique vulnerabilities — but the group left almost all of that work to others, buying exploits as they became available and abandoning them as patches became more common. ""We get a lot of upset website admins."" Still, even with all of Huang's detail on the group, it's unlikely they'll be brought to justice any time soon. There’s still plenty of work left to do in tracing the network back to individual people, and it’s unclear who’ll want to step in and do it. Taking down a botnet is a notoriously long and drawn-out process, and while Russian law enforcement has made some major busts in recent years, it may not be impressed by an outfit this size. The most Huang can hope for is a little more cred the next time he tells a site that he's found an infection. ""We get a lot of upset website admins who believe we’ve falsely accused them of an infection,"" Huang says. ""So we’re certainly hoping that those people will read this report"" More broadly, it’s a sign of how far web security still has to go. Researchers pay a lot of attention to breaches like Heartbleed, which give attackers an initial foothold, and vulnerabilities in popular software, which let them exploit individual users. But lingering infections like this one are often overlooked. As a result, once an attacker builds a backdoor into a server or a site, it can take years for the proper owners to regain control. For the half a million computers detailed in the report, that’s a troubling thought.",0.42234710498603273,0.5776528950139672,0.8336493580635859,965,4.9108808290155439,501,6.0598802395209583,0,4,"US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Ever since the PRISM documents began leaking in 2013, tech companies have been pressing the government for permission to publicly publish more information about how much information they've had to hand over. That pressure culminated in a deal earlier this year that allowed the publication of NSLs and FISA orders, so long as they were in those huge ranges. However, that deal was reached by the government and Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, and Yahoo — not Twitter. Though the rule applies to Twitter, Twitter isn't happy with it and is now by and large looking to have it invalidated along with other rules that prevent national security request figures from being published.

Efforts are being made in areas across the globe to eradicate the pesky rodents, but as good as we are at fighting them, they're even better at coming back. Could physicists eventually build a rocket engine that doesn't require fuel? Scientists at NASA and in a few labs around the world are working on it, but don't hold out too much hope: the ""impossible engine"" is probably as impossible as its name implies. Autonomous driving is going to be a huge deal, and that's particularly true in the trucking industry. The technology has the ability to keep drivers more awake and aware of their surroundings — even when their hands aren't actually on the wheel.

Stern details the gruesome, botched execution of Oklahoma’s Clayton Lockett, and what it says about capital punishment.  Before a team of correctional officers came to get him at 5:06 a.m., he fashioned a noose out of his sheets. He pulled the blade out of a safety razor and made half-inch-long cuts on his arms. He swallowed a handful of pills that he’d been hoarding. And on April 29, 2014, when the team of officers knocked on the door of his cell in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma, Clayton Lockett—a 38-year-old convicted murderer—pulled a blanket over his head and refused to get up. The New YorkerRaffi Khatchadourian reports on engineers and architects who are building an entire video game world that will, essentially, be infinite. When I first met with Murray, at his studio, earlier this year, he had just flown back from the North American headquarters of Sony PlayStation, in California. He had a long relationship with Sony. A few days before he unveiled the No Man’s Sky trailer, in 2013, he had distributed versions of it to people in the industry, and Sony had been immediately interested. “I sent Sean a barrage of texts,” Shahid Ahmad, a director of strategic content at Sony PlayStation, told me. “I said, ‘We need to get this on PlayStation. Tell me what you need.’” The New York Times Magazine Anna Holmes on the concept of “shade.” Shade is currently having another moment, in no small part because of the ascendancy of the African-American vernacular in both popular culture and digital media. Perhaps the most famous avatar of shade right now, aside from the star of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” is the character Cookie Lyon, the star of Fox’s hit show “Empire,” played by Taraji P. Henson. Cookie, the ex-wife of a music mogul, is a fiercely proud, no-nonsense matriarch whose talent for delivering withering looks and devastating one-liners — “The streets ain’t made for everybody, that’s why they made sidewalks” — is unmatched on television. (A Google search for the words “Cookie,” “Empire” and “shade” results in almost half a million hits.) But shade’s most fertile terrain is the quippy, contentious milieu of social media, which prizes bursts of verbal virtuosity. The New York Times Robin Marantz Henig tells the story of Sandy Bem, a psychology professor who realizes she has Alzheimer’s and makes the decision to end her own life. Sandy was a small woman, just 4-­foot-­9 and 94 pounds, with an androgynous-­pixie look: cropped hair, glasses and a wardrobe that skewed toward jeans and comfortable sweaters she knit herself in the 1990s. As she watched the documentary, her pulse thrumming in her ears, a woman on screen took a memory test. Sandy decided to take it along with her. Listen to three words, the examiner said, write a sentence of your choice and then try to remember the three words. Sandy heard the three words: “apple,” “table,” “penny.” She wrote a brief sentence: “I was born in Pittsburgh.” She said aloud the words she could remember: “apple,” “penny”... The simplest of memory tests, and she had failed.  Medium DJ Pizzo profiles Stones Throw affiliate Aloe Blacc. Among these things out of left-field is a mysterious, unreleased “children’s album” that Aloe recorded in 2005 during his tenure at Stones Throw, which he distributed hand-to-hand to his close personal friends. The album has otherwise been kept airtight, as it has not been uploaded to the internet and remains largely undiscovered by fans. Even the ridiculously thorough music archive what.cd has no listing for the children’s record, although it has every other release of his career, along with plenty of unreleased cuts from Dr. Dre’s Detox. This San Diego-based, animal-monikered band hides their backbone of classic hippie-surf in a wash of cool-kid feedback.

The Rift has come a long way from its first crude prototype, and so has VR — something that was once just a really cool way to play Doom has now attracted attracted a wide range of filmmakers, journalists, artists, scientists, and even Facebook, which bought Oculus in 2014. But the finished product certainly isn't the casual, social telepresence machine that Mark Zuckerberg imagined when he first bought Oculus. Zuckerberg's vision looks a lot more like the Gear VR: the $200 mobile headset that runs off Samsung's phones. Instead, the Rift is — and might be, for a while — consumer virtual reality's cutting edge. Oculus just published the recommended PC specs for its consumer headset, which minimizes lag and, by extension, motion sickness and disorientation. And the full Rift experience turns out to be a bit of an exclusive one. It doesn't just take a gaming PC, it takes a desktop with some of the latest and most expensive parts on the market; the graphics card alone costs around $350, and the whole thing prices out to around $1,000 at minimum. While this isn't the upper limit of gaming PCs, that's partly because it's hard to tell where the upper limit even is — if you're so inclined, you can start with a $1,000 graphics card and go up from there. And these costs only apply if you're building the PC yourself. A pre-built machine comes at an even greater premium. The Rift's specs will get less daunting, but it's still not a casual purchase There are a few important caveats to these prices. Most obviously, the consumer edition of the Rift isn't coming out until the first quarter of 2016, so the parts won't be new by that time. Oculus says the specs are locked in for ""the lifetime of the Rift"" — however long that proves to be, it will probably give people more leeway than the video game upgrade cycle. By the time anyone is in a position to buy a consumer Rift, finding a PC to support it will be a lot easier — you might even be able to use a laptop, which you can't count on right now. And these are also the ""recommended"" specs, implying a lower absolute minimum. Even so, it's not going to be a casual purchase. These might be mid-tier gaming PC parts by next year, but they're still gaming PC parts, not things you'll find in somebody's everyday machine. And that's not a trivial distinction. Traditional computers are becoming less and less central to our lives, so as our sister site Polygon writes, the PC ends up being more like a separate gaming console. And whatever I feel as a PC gamer, there are a lot of reasons for people to pick up an actual home console to use with something like Sony's Project Morpheus instead — user-friendliness, local multiplayer, and cost, to name a few. This will probably be doubly true for Valve and HTC's Vive, which is touting itself as an even more high-end experience and is coming out sooner. ""We haven't yet announced PC requirements for HTC Vive, but we can confirm Vive is a premium VR experience that will require a premium PC,"" an HTC spokesperson told us, confirming that Vive is still set to appear before the end of 2015. What the Rift and Vive can offer is a preview of the experiences that could work on lower-end headsets within a year or two. If VR actually does go mainstream, most people might still never buy an Oculus Rift, but they can reap the benefits of game developers, researchers, and industrial designers figuring out what works on a high-definition headset with a wider range of motion and (in Valve's case) fairly sophisticated controllers.

A number of people have already responded that the solution to the show's casting problems is for The Simpsons to finally end. That almost happened in December 2011 due to similar circumstances. ""Holidays of Future Passed"" was written as a potential series finale. At the time J. Stewart Burns penned the script, long before the episode's air date, the show's producers knew they were about to enter a fresh contract negotiation round with the leads. By fall of 2011, Fox was asking the primary actors to take a rumored 45 percent cut from the $8-million-a-year salaries. In late September 2011, it looked like the two parties had reached an impasse, and that the 495th episode of the show would be its last. That would have been okay. This would have been a great series finale The episode has all the trappings of a heartfelt goodbye to one of television's best programs. Creator Matt Groening makes a cameo. We learn what happens in the future to the Simpsons family. And the Christmas setting makes for a nice bookend to the show's pilot, ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire."" Summarizing a great episode of television is like explaining a funny joke, it's better to just experience the thing firsthand. Which you can if you have access to FXX's The Simpsons World. I'll keep this brief. After a conversation about the importance of family photos, the show speeds forward 30 years. The children are living the adult extensions of their childhoods. Maggie is the lead singer of a band, and she's about to give birth. Bart is divorced, and is spending the holidays with his two sons he rarely sees. Lisa is particularly successful as a businesswoman, but she's frustrated by her dull husband Milhouse and rebellious daughter, Zia.   The entire family — grandparents to grandchildren — come together in Marge and Homer's house, where they quarrel about proper parenting, and how it's tough to forgive the transgressions and hypocrisies of the people who raised us, all of which is embodied in Homer's decision to unfreeze Grandpa from a cryogenic chamber. Grandpa was frozen to prevent a disease from killing him, one that has long been cured. It's all about family Grandpa is defrosted, Maggie gives birth, and the family forgives one another, recognizing they're flawed individuals with profound, unconditional love. And so they gather in the living room for a family photo, taken by Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II, who have evolved into super beings. The episode delivers the occasional dull joke, but the meat of the story connects. Plus, for tech savvy viewers, the episode is also a smart commentary on how we will interact with each other in a future spent wearing goggles that place us inside of virtual spaces. What I'm saying is, if you are the sort of person that hasn't watched The Simpsons because you believe it should have ended long ago, then you're in luck. Because that kind of sort of almost happened, and the result is everything a fan could hope for.",0.6285210407093957,0.37147895929060426,0.39370567929877626,547,4.8610603290676417,337,5.8872403560830859,1,2,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

But today, Oculus has published the actual recommended specs for a Rift-compatible computer. Here's what you'll need: That's certainly not the world's most expensive PC — it doesn't, for example, involve the Titan X graphics card that Nvidia introduced specifically with VR in mind. But our very rough mockup puts it at around $1,000 or more for a desktop, and laptop owners are probably out of luck, according to Oculus chief architect Atman Binstock: Many discrete GPU laptops have their external video output connected to the integrated GPU and drive the external output via hardware and software mechanisms that can’t support the Rift. Since this isn’t something that can be determined by reading the specs of a laptop, we are working on how to identify the right systems. Note that almost no current laptops have the GPU performance for the recommended spec, though upcoming mobile GPUs may be able to support this level of performance. While Mitchell suggested this last week as well, it's now clear that the Rift is Windows-only for the moment: Our development for OS X and Linux has been paused in order to focus on delivering a high quality consumer-level VR experience at launch across hardware, software, and content on Windows. We want to get back to development for OS X and Linux but we don't have a timeline. These high-end specs are needed because VR requires a high framerate for all its experiences — if it drops, you'll start getting sick very quickly. Oculus promises that the specs will stay the same for the lifetime of the current Rift consumer edition, so they'll presumably get cheaper as time goes on. For now, though, the Rift is still very much a device for somebody who's willing to put money towards an expensive PC... which right now is mostly gamers.",0.5043992218224742,0.4956007781775258,0.20090544446391964,327,4.8715596330275233,212,5.6367924528301883,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It should fade into the background and allow human-friendly design to flourish and delight us. Logitech is embracing that premise wholeheartedly with a major brand redesign being announced today. The company is moving to a bold new color palette, tweaking its logo, and launching a shiny new sub-brand called Logi. Logi is, in the words of Chief Design Officer Alastair Curtis, for ""future-facing stuff, it will start to define new categories and new business spaces."" ""Design as an ethos and a mentality"" In speaking with The Verge ahead of today's announcement, Curtis set out the vision for a more cohesive company that creates products with ""design as an ethos and a mentality."" Whereas previously Logitech might have done its design sequentially — meaning the industrial design, packaging, retail experience, and software were all done as separate steps — the new Logitech is going to design ""the whole experience"" of buying and owning one of its products as one. And if his emphasis on bold colors looks familiar, that will be because Logitech's CDO was the head of design at Nokia before taking up his current post in July of 2013. Over the course of the past two years, he has been putting together a proper design team, staffing up with other former Nokians as well as people with experience at Nike, Samsung, BlackBerry, and other well known brands.   All of this sounds rather ill-defined and marketing-heavy for now, but Logitech says it'll soon start introducing the products that will define its Logi brand and the conceit inherent in dropping the ""tech"" from the company's full name. Logitech remains the proper company name, and according to Curtis, ""whether we as a company completely transition to Logi over the next two or three years is yet to be seen."" Also unchanged is Logitech's core business, which consists of making PC peripherals, gaming gear bearing the Logitech G name, and audio equipment under the subsidiary Ultimate Ears brand. The new Logi label will be attached to the company's more experimental and futuristic projects, which Curtis says will include products for the Internet of Things, both ""in the home and automotive space.""",0.6119483536740402,0.3880516463259598,0.8657844603006984,381,5.015748031496063,234,5.9572649572649574,0,2,Tech,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It had great image quality, great ergonomics, and a class-leading viewfinder. It easily became my favorite camera of the year. But for all that the X-T1 offered, it was expensive and big. Neither of those things deterred serious photographers from plunking down the money and putting the X-T1 into their gear bags, but what if you’re a more casual photographer that wants a lot of what the X-T1 offers without the investment or bulk?That’s where this year’s X-T10 comes in. It’s essentially a shrunken down version of the X-T1 that costs less yet preserves a lot of what makes the X-T1 great. The X-T1 was so loved by myself and many other enthusiast (and even some pro) photographers because of its great shooting experience. Like many of Fujifilm’s recent cameras, it rewards you for taking control, manually adjusting settings, pushing its buttons, flipping its switches, and toggling its dials. That kind of control is what makes the process of photography fun, and the X-T1 paid back those that took advantage of its copious buttons and switches with fast performance and excellent image quality. In order to really be an appropriate alternative to the X-T1, the X-T10 needs to provide a similar level of control and experience. On paper, it has the right mix: it has the same image sensor and processor; a similar design with many of the same controls; and an excellent, albeit smaller, electronic viewfinder. It’s significantly smaller than the X-T1, however, and perhaps most importantly, the X-T10 is considerably less expensive: at $799.99 for the body or $1,099.99 with an 18-55mm kit lens, it’s up to $600 cheaper than the X-T1 was when it debuted.I’ve been shooting with one for the past few weeks, using it as my go-to camera for everything work related as well as for my own personal photography. I’ve used it for shooting all kinds of gadgets, in both controlled situations and on the fly, and it’s turned out to be a really impressive camera that holds its own against the much more expensive X-T1.   Everything about the X-T10 is smaller than the X-T1, which makes it easier to slip into a bag or sling over your shoulder. The downside is that it can feel more cramped when shooting — the grip isn’t nearly as comfortable, for example, and you have to be really conscious of where you place your right thumb so as not to accidentally trigger a button or switch. The viewfinder and LCD are smaller than they are on the X-T1, and if I’m being honest, not as impressive or engulfing. But they are still really good, and I didn’t miss any shots or feel like I was missing out on the X-T1’s larger porthole when using the X-T10. The viewfinder is sharp and bright, and large enough for the vast majority of people that aren’t going to compare it side by side with its larger sibling. Fujifilm also simplified some of the controls on the X-T10. The metering switch below the shutter speed dial is gone, and the dedicated ISO dial on the left has been replaced with a drive dial. The front function button has also been integrated into the front command dial, which is a smart way to make use of the limited space on the X-T10. But while some of the controls have changed, the important ones remain: the X-T10 provides quick access to shutter speeds, apertures, exposure compensation, and a variety of other parameters such as ISO, autofocus modes, and white balance through its seven customizable function buttons. Owners of the X-T1 and anyone that prefers a more manual style of shooting will feel at home very quickly on the X-T10. There are a couple additions here to appeal to more novice photographers as well. A simple auto switch will instantly put the camera into a point-and-shoot mode, regardless of what the other controls are set to. And there’s now a built-in pop-up flash for basic fill lighting. (Advanced photographers will appreciate the built-in flash’s ability to trigger other remote flashes using its commander mode.) But for the most part, the X-T10 has a similar shooting experience as the X-T1 and is just as fun to use.   The X-T10 also performs just as well as the X-T1. Since it has the same 16-megapixel APS-C CMOS image sensor and processor, picture quality between the two cameras is nigh indistinguishable. I have no qualms shooting the Fujifilm cameras up to ISO 6400, as noise reduction is limited, and the high-ISO images have a nice, film-like grain to them. Color reproduction is very pleasing and natural, even in tricky lighting conditions. Fujifilm has long been praised for its in-camera JPEG processing, and the X-T10 is no different. (Really, just read any of my reviews of Fujifilm cameras over the past few years and you’ll see what I’m talking about.) There are a number of different ""film simulations"" on tap as well, which provide different moods and looks for your images right out of the camera. The X-T10 debuts a new, more capable autofocus system for Fujifilm (the X-T1 recently received this new system via a firmware update). It’s faster, has more tracking points, and includes modern capabilities such fast face detection and eye detection. In practice, it’s by far the best autofocus system Fujifilm has ever had, as it’s quick and reliable in most lighting conditions. It still won’t keep up with a larger DSLR, but the frustrating autofocus experience that used to plague Fujifilm cameras is finally a thing of the past. Video is an area where Fujifilm still has a lot of catching up to do, and the X-T10’s basic video capabilities pale in comparison to what you can get with Sony, Samsung, or Panasonic mirrorless cameras. It can do 1080p at a handful of different frame rates, but the video quality isn’t as detailed or pleasing to watch as what other cameras produce. It’s clear that Fujifilm is building its cameras for still photography first and video capability second, which is something to keep in mind if you’re looking to buy one. The X-T10 lacks a touchscreen, but has built-in Wi-Fi, which lets you remotely control the camera or transfer images to your iPhone or Android phone on the go. The rechargeable battery is good for 350 shots between charges (there’s no USB charging here, sadly), and the body is made of metal with grippy rubber patches covering it. It lacks the weather sealing of the X-T1, but most people won’t miss that and it’s only beneficial if the lens attached is also waterproof, which not all of Fujifilm’s lenses are. As I’ve been using the X-T10 for the past few weeks, I’ve had a hard time coming up with reasons to purchase the X-T1 over it. The X-T10 is just as fast, takes just as good photos, and is just as fun to use at a price that’s hundreds of dollars less. It also has the same access to Fujifilm’s excellent lineup of X Series lenses, including gems such as the 23mm f/1.4 and 35mm f/1.4, which are bright, sharp, and just a blast to shoot with. Don’t sleep on Fujifilm’s 18-55mm kit lens either, which is nicer and brighter than virtually any other kit lens you can buy. You can opt to buy the X-T10 with a slower 16-50mm lens for $899.99, but I wouldn’t recommend it — just pony up for the better 18-55, you won't regret it. There are a ton of affordable mirrorless cameras available that are compact, take great photos, and are easy to use. But few cameras in this range can match the X-T10’s fun factor and, dare I say it, engagement level — there’s just something wonderful about having a ton of controls at your fingertips without having to dive into arcane menus on a screen. Pushing buttons and turning dials may not sound like much, but when you are able to produce stunning images and capture priceless memories with something that you’ve controlled, the satisfaction of a job well done is that much greater. It’s a dangerous drug — and the core of why so many photographers love their gear, no matter what it is — but it’s exactly why camera enthusiasts go nuts over cameras like the X-T10. Simply put, Fujifilm's cameras do a better job of combining that great shooting experience with amazing image quality better than any others in their class. I’ve mentioned the word ""fun"" a lot in this review, and I think it’s an apt description for the X-T10. Photography can be Really Serious, but it can also be a ton of fun and provide lots of enjoyment. Part of that fun is the tools you use to get the job done, and of all the cameras I’ve shot with, few are as fun as the X-T10. And the fact that all of this is available in a camera that doesn't require a pro photography budget is all the more impressive.

In recent weeks former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop has departed Microsoft, alongside the company's head of phones Jo Harlow. Nadella warned of ""tough choices in areas where things are not working,"" and it appears we're seeing the first major signs of that today. Microsoft is cutting 7,800 jobs primarily in its phone business, and the company is writing off $7.6 billion related to its acquisition of the Nokia phone business. That's more than the $7.2 billion Microsoft paid for Nokia's phone business last year. A more focused phone portfolio will mean less Lumias ""We are moving from a strategy to grow a standalone phone business to a strategy to grow and create a vibrant Windows ecosystem including our first-party device family,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says in an email to employees today. ""In the near-term, we’ll run a more effective and focused phone portfolio while retaining capability for long-term reinvention in mobility."" The new job cuts follow 18,000 over the past 12 months that Nadella originally announced nearly a year ago. Microsoft completed the majority of those cuts back in April, so these new reductions are part of the company's new financial year. It's not immediately clear what a ""more effective and focused phone portfolio"" means for the future of Microsoft's Lumia phones, but with the exit of Elop and Harlow it's clear Microsoft isn't as focused on creating a big spread of Lumia devices anymore. Microsoft is planning two new high-end Lumia devices for its Windows 10 Mobile software later this year, but we're unlikely to see the high number of mid- and low-range devices that Nokia used to produce regularly. Nadella says he's committed to first-party devices like phones, but that the company will focus on three areas: business, value phones, and flagships. It sounds like there will be a lot less Lumia devices produced in the future as a result. Nadella's full memo can be found below: Team, Over the past few weeks, I've shared with you our mission, strategy, structure and culture. Today, I want to discuss our plans to focus our talent and investments in areas where we have differentiation and potential for growth, as well as how we'll partner to drive better scale and results. In all we do, we will take a long-term view and build deep technical capability that allows us to innovate in the future. With that context, I want to update you on decisions impacting our phone business and share more on last week's mapping and display advertising announcements. We anticipate that these changes, in addition to other headcount alignment changes, will result in the reduction of up to 7,800 positions globally, primarily in our phone business. We expect that the reductions will take place over the next several months. I don't take changes in plans like these lightly, given that they affect the lives of people who have made an impact at Microsoft. We are deeply committed to helping our team members through these transitions. Phones. Today, we announced a fundamental restructuring of our phone business. As a result, the company will take an impairment charge of approximately $7.6 billion related to assets associated with the acquisition of the Nokia Devices and Services business in addition to a restructuring charge of approximately $750 million to $850 million. I am committed to our first-party devices including phones. However, we need to focus our phone efforts in the near term while driving reinvention. We are moving from a strategy to grow a standalone phone business to a strategy to grow and create a vibrant Windows ecosystem that includes our first-party device family. In the near term, we will run a more effective phone portfolio, with better products and speed to market given the recently formed Windows and Devices Group. We plan to narrow our focus to three customer segments where we can make unique contributions and where we can differentiate through the combination of our hardware and software. We'll bring business customers the best management, security and productivity experiences they need; value phone buyers the communications services they want; and Windows fans the flagship devices they'll love. In the longer term, Microsoft devices will spark innovation, create new categories and generate opportunity for the Windows ecosystem more broadly. Our reinvention will be centered on creating mobility of experiences across the entire device family including phones. Mapping. Last week, we announced changes to our mapping business and transferred some of our imagery acquisition operations to Uber. We will continue to source base mapping data and imagery from partners. This allows us to focus our efforts on delivering great map products such as Bing Maps, Maps app for Windows and our Bing Maps for Enterprise APIs. Advertising. We also announced our decision to sharpen our focus in advertising platform technology and concentrate on search, while we partner with AOL and AppNexus for display. Bing will now power search and search advertising across the AOL portfolio of sites, in addition to the partnerships we already have with Yahoo!, Amazon and Apple. Concentrating on search will help us further accelerate the progress we've been making over the past six years. Last year Bing grew to 20 percent query share in the U.S. while growing our search advertising revenue 28 percent over the past 12 months. We view search technology as core to our efforts spanning Bing.com, Cortana, Office 365, Windows 10 and Azure services. I deeply appreciate all of the ideas and hard work of everyone involved in these businesses, and I want to reiterate my commitment to helping each individual impacted. I know many of you have questions about these changes. I will host an employee Q&A tomorrow to share more, and I hope you can join me.

Users can connect their microcomputer to bigger devices by Bluetooth or USB, or to the similarly tiny Raspberry Pi through it's input-output rings. The tiny Micro Bit can connect via USB or Bluetooth The final design has one major change from the prototype shown in March — instead of a slimline watch battery, the device is now powered by two AA batteries.

""However in reviewing the design and examining the health and safety implications of using small batteries for a young audience, where siblings may be able to access the device, the partnership took the decision to re-engineer this element."" The change makes the Micro Bit slightly less portable, and less practical to be used as a wearable device, but should also make it easier for kids to keep it operational.   BBC Learning head Sinead Rocks said the project was about ""young people learning to express themselves digitally"" through coding. Suggested projects for the Micro Bit include using its magnetometer to turn it into a metal detector, using it to control a DVD player, or programming its buttons to work as a video game controller. After the devices go out to school children later this year, the BBC and its partners in the project are planning to make the Micro Bit available for purchase, and its specifications open source.

At least one of the vulnerabilities has been patched by Adobe; users are advised to update Flash as soon as possible. Another day, another Adobe Flash vulnerability Two vulnerabilities have been discovered, affecting Adobe’s Flash software and Microsoft’s Windows operating system. Hacking Team describes the Flash flaw as ""the most beautiful Flash bug for the last four years,"" suggesting that the company may have been using this to access people’s machines for quite some time. The vulnerability itself allows malicious attackers to execute code on a victim’s machine through a website. It affects Windows, OS X, and Linux, and can be used against browsers like IE, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Hacking Team appears to have used this hole to install its own exploit kits and monitor or remotely control PCs. Adobe is now aware of the vulnerability and a patch has been issued, but given the vast amount of security issues with Flash over the years it's advisable to move away from using the software if you're able to. The second vulnerability affects an Adobe font driver in Windows. All 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows are affected from Windows XP through to Windows 8.1, according to researchers. The flaw itself lets attackers elevate their privileges on a machine to administrator level. Combined with the Adobe Flash exploit, it’s a powerful way to hijack a PC.

One of the quirks of sea turtles, along with many other reptiles, is that temperature determines the sex of their offspring. At around 84.2 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius) the ratio of males to females is fairly even, but as temperature rises, more and more hatchlings end up as females. Researchers from Swansea University in Wales calculated how that will change for one major population of sea turtles as the globe warms over the next century, and while they found that it would mean a growing population at first, eventually there will be too few males around.   ""The possibility of sea turtles becoming extinct is not a far-fetched scenario.""Their research, which is being published today in Nature Climate Change, was focused on a population of loggerhead turtles in Sal, Cape Verde, an island to the west of Northern Africa. For the past 150 years, the temperature there has put the number of female hatchlings laid on light-sand beaches between roughly 50 and 70 percent of those born. Right now, the population of Sal is beginning to see a distinct uptick in the number of females, and the researchers believe that will steadily increase to around 80 percent of hatchlings on light-sand beaches in 2050 to about 98 percent by 2100. ""The possibility of sea turtles becoming extinct is not a far-fetched scenario,"" Graeme Hays, Swansea's aquatic biology chair, says in a statement. Even though the sex ratio will tip heavily toward females at Sal in the near future, male turtles' tendency to mate more often means that the population should be able to continue growing for a while. But eventually, the researchers say that human intervention will likely be necessary to cool the turtles' nests to ensure that males are brought into the population. ""Eventually a point will be reached when there are insufficient males to fertilize all eggs,"" they write. ""Ultimately if males are so scarce that egg fertility is compromised, management intervention will be needed. Translocating nests from dark beaches to [cooler] light beaches could be a strategy to produce more male hatchlings. Another strategy would be to shade nests (for example, with beach vegetation) to lower incubation temperatures."" Though the paper only focuses on Sal, the researchers say that it can be repeated just about anywhere — and may need to be in order to monitor the safety of populations. The researchers also warn that warming isn't likely to be the only big impact on sea turtles over the next century: in particular, rising sea levels could lead to the destruction of the beaches where they mate. Still, the researchers' estimates show a striking example of how changing climates can impact a population.

In the Rocky mountains, one center is trying to demystify the destructive force. The Fire Lab in Missoula, Montana, was built in 1960 for the purposes of understanding fire in all of its forms. The Atlantic's short documentary about the lab, Fire, in Slow Motion, shows how its staff use specially designed apparatus such as wind tunnels and fire-whirl generators to simulate forest and wildfires, before analyzing the results. Researchers at the Fire Lab seem to have a satisfying job.

It's estimated that the parent asteroid — a much larger object from which the so-called Chelyabinsk meteor broke off — impacted another asteroid in space at anywhere from 800 to 3,350 miles per hour (1,440 – 5,400 km/h). That second asteroid, according to the hypothesis, was at least 500 feet (150m) in diameter, and the impact sent the final 65-foot (20m) wide meteor in Earth's direction. The findings come after scientists studied small fragments of the Chelyabinsk meteor that made it through the massive explosion in Earth's atmosphere and landed on the ground. Lead researcher Shin Ozawa, of Japan's University of Tohoku, and his team found a mineral called jadeite in glass-like veins inside the samples. That mineral could only be produced under massive pressure and heat, such as that from an impact with another asteroid. By studying the shape and structure of the jadeite crystals, they were able to estimate the size, temperature, and duration of the impact. The results were published this week in Scientific Reports. Previously, scientists had used video footage to determine the path of the meteor to Earth, and analysis of the impact found it to be the second largest explosion in recorded history. Correction: Researchers have not concluded that an asteroid impact caused the meteorite to head towards Earth, they have hypothesized that such events could explain the presence of jadeite in the meteorite.

Until February, many experts suggested that the best place to put it was a facility about 40 miles east of Carlsbad, New Mexico, called the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). For 15 years, WIPP has operated as the first and only permanent, deep geologic nuclear waste storage facility in the country, holding ""low level"" radioactive materials — mostly clothing and tools exposed to radiation from nuclear weapons production — in steel barrels more than 2,150 feet below the Earth’s surface. But earlier this year two emergencies brought that suggestion — and WIPP’s future — into question. And now it seems kitty litter may be to blame. WIPP is in a salt desert, and much of the work there involves burrowing through the salt and using huge elevators to deposit the stuff at surface level. The resulting underground caverns are then filled with radioactive waste and eventually closed shut, sealed forever.  Investigators search for a radiation leak at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, NM. (Department of Energy) In February, according to a press release from the US Department of Energy — which oversees operations at WIPP — two things happened to stall that relatively simple process. First, on February 5th, a salt-hauling truck caught fire. That would be an inconvenience on the side of a highway, but in an enclosed salt cavern surrounded by nuclear waste, it’s a potential catastrophe. Workers evacuated the site. Fortunately no one was hurt. But the fire was significant enough to shut down underground operations until investigators could figure out what happened and how to stop it from happening again. Surface-level operations continued. But not for long. Nine days later, late at night on Valentine’s Day, an alarm sounded, indicating that radioactivity was present in the air underground. No one was below ground at the time, but employees on the surface activated massive fans designed to ventilate the underground air. The next day, another monitor went off — this one on the surface — indicating airborne radiation. Employees who worked outside on the surface were told to take shelter inside buildings completely separated from storage operations. Valves allowing air to flow underground were sealed with high-density expanding foam. Everything came to a standstill, indefinitely. There are no indications that anyone has been injured from the radiation leak. (All employees went through examinations for radiation exposure; a DOE press release says most workers were not affected, and those who were ""received less exposure than a person receives from a chest X-ray."") But for months, nothing has changed. The standstill remains. WIPP’s 850 or so employees are mainly sitting around, waiting (or ""performing surface facilities maintenance or assisting with procedure reviews and revisions"") while investigators from the US Department of Energy (DOE), the New Mexico Environment Department and elsewhere attempt to figure out what happened. Initially, there were two hypotheses. The first was that something had gone wrong with the supports inside the cavern where waste was being stored. If that were the case, it meant a piece of salt rock or a steel support had fallen into one of the sealed barrels, puncturing it and releasing radiation into the air. ""That was an unlikely possibility,"" says Norbert T. Rempe, PhD, a retired geologist who spent decades as a principal engineer at WIPP. The cavern where the radiation monitor went off had been dug only recently, so the chances that supports had eroded or collapsed were probably slim.       Organic kitty litter likely caused a steel barrel's seal to puncture at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, NM. The damage and the resulting radiation leak could close the facility, experts say. (Department of Energy) More likely, he said, was the second hypothesis: that something had gone awry inside one of the radioactive containers — that the radioactive material had become hot for some reason, expanding and puncturing a steel barrel from the inside. Last month, DOE investigators went into the cavern. Pictures showed that the latter hypothesis was true; a waste container’s lid was unsealed, and dust around the lid had turned yellow from the unusual heat emanating from inside. Each barrel is labeled to track where it came from. The punctured barrel originated from Los Alamos National Labs. Jim Conca, PhD, a geologist who worked for years at WIPP who now blogs at Forbes about energy issues, believes he knows what blew the lid off at least one of WIPP’s radioactive barrels. The culprit, he wrote, was kitty litter. ""When someone decides to deviate, that is a bad, bad thing."" As Conca explains it, inorganic cat litter has properties that make it ideal for stabilizing nitrates in radioactive material — for ensuring that it doesn’t dry out and become dangerously hot. So kitty litter is often mixed in barrels with the low-level waste that’s eventually sent to WIPP. What happened at WIPP, he believes, is that one of the radioactive shipments was mixed with organic instead of inorganic material. ""‘Green’ cat litter,"" he writes, is ""made with materials like wheat or corn. These organic litters do not have the silicate properties needed to chemically stabilize nitrate the correct way."" The result: ""solutions can ignite when they dry out."" In other words, the whole problem at WIPP — the radiation leak, the months-long stall in operations, the worries over safety — results from one person’s mess up. (Yesterday, a DOE press release confirmed that kitty litter ""may have caused a chemical reaction"" that lead to the leak.) ""Everything nuclear is proceduralized,"" he tells The Verge. ""It’s well laid out and everything everyone does is supposed to go up and down the chain of command. When you decide on a procedure for doing something like treating this waste, you don’t deviate from it. Ever. And when someone decides to deviate, that is a bad, bad thing."" He continues: ""In this case, it could shut down the most successful nuclear repository in history."" Apart from the absurdity in a multibillion-dollar project halted by the decision to use off-brand kitty litter, the real lesson here may lie in the fragility of even the best nuclear storage facility. Corrective action at WIPP could be a massive undertaking. How many other barrels contain the dangerous organic cat litter? Are all of those barrels underground at WIPP? Are they awaiting shipment at surface level in places like Los Alamos? Or are they located at the temporary storage site in Andrews, Texas, where some containers were transferred when problems arose at WIPP? ""Expert assessment will be needed,"" writes Per Peterson, a professor and researcher at UC Berkeley’s Department of Nuclear Engineering, in an email shared with The Verge, to merely ""determine whether the safety benefits of stabilizing or repackaging the material in these drums are justified by the risk to personnel who would attempt to do this work."" And if the DOE decides stabilizing or repackaging the material is unjustified, that would close WIPP for good. ""If that happened, it would be a shame and a disaster — particularly for taxpayers,"" says the retired WIPP geologist Rempe. The DOE estimates the total cost of the WIPP plant to be $7.2 billion. Even if WIPP does begin operating again, ""we have no idea how long this will take until WIPP is back to normal operations, or what the new normal operations will be,"" Rempe says. ""No one knows right now.

By sorting through restaurant reviews left on Yelp, New York City's Health Department has been able to identify and investigate disease outbreaks, ultimately finding food-handling violations at restaurants that otherwise would have gone unnoticed.   The method was resource intensive, but it workedAn initial trial was conducted in partnership with Yelp and Columbia University for nine months between 2012 and 2013. Yelp provided an easily parseable stream of public reviews left on restaurants throughout the city, and a computer analyzed all of those for signs that they included complaints of illness. From around 294,000 reviews, 893 were automatically flagged, and manual review found that 56 percent of them were actually about potential food poisoning. The department attempted to contact 129 reviewers, whose comments sounded consistent with a disease outbreak, but only heard back from 27 of them. From those, they ended up finding three restaurants with multiple violations. That's a small final number, and New York City's Health Department admits that using this method can be relatively resource intensive. But they say that it's something that other health departments should consider: diners appeared not to know about New York's existing health reporting line, and they expect that people will increasingly be posting their complaints through various forms of social media. ""By incorporating website review data into public health surveillance programs, health departments might find additional illnesses and improve detection of foodborne disease outbreaks in the community,"" reads a report describing their results that's being published today by the ￼Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. New York City plans to continue the project, expanding it to tap into even more restaurant review websites to improve its results. It also says that it could potentially find more issues by expanding the criteria it uses to narrow down the flagged reviews, which were meant to be fairly specific during the trial. One of the other big troubles with searching through Yelp is that the Health Department wants to interview the people complaining before they investigate further, and that means they have to message those reviewers over Yelp and hope for a response. This type of method for identifying health issues isn't entirely new — Google's data has long been analyzed to discover flu trends, and similar analysis has been done on tweets. But the investigators say that reviews can be useful in a much different way than Google's data, allowing them to identify outbreaks on a small scale and at their source. So far, it's proven to be an effective way to find ongoing issues, and New York City's Health Department thinks they could become even more useful if there was just an easy way for them to get in touch with reviewers complaining of illness.",0.3663800639679195,0.6336199360320804,0.8720572046728444,470,5.3255319148936167,276,6.1630434782608692,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

HAARP, an acronym for High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, has been implicated in everything from mind control to extreme weather like hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and tornados since the project's origins in the early ’90s.

But scientists have always waved off such claims as completely ludicrous. ""We're moving on to other ways of managing the ionosphere.""

Instead, the facility — which is run jointly by the US Air Force and US Navy with additional funding from DARPA and the University of Alaska — is involved in a range of studies on the ionosphere. In particular, research has focused on using the upper layer of the atmosphere to enhance communications technologies. The facility uses 33 acres of high-frequency antennas to send signals into the upper atmosphere. Those signals are reflected back and then examined to study how the ionosphere affected the signals. David Walker, an Air Force official tasked with overseeing much of the branch's science and technology research efforts, told Congress this week that HAARP is ""not an area that we have any need for in the future,"" according to the Anchorage Daily News.

As a paleoartist, it’s his job to illustrate just what dinosaurs and other extinct species really looked like, using a combination of research and artistic skill to recreate creatures and scenes that no-one has ever seen before. His work has been used to depict the discovery of new dinosaurs, and to illustrate museum exhibits across North America. He even created dinosaurs featured on a series of glow-in-the-dark coins issued by the Royal Canadian Mint. It's a process that has evolved quite a bit over time — while Csotonyi started out using pencils and ink to sketch towering dinosaurs, he now uses a complex process that meshes digital techniques and photography in order to create work that's as accurate as possible. ""My intent is often to endeavor to create as realistic a reconstruction as possible of scenes that we cannot go out and photograph,"" he explains, ""since they are in the deep past.""     A native of Edmonton, Csotonyi's interest in drawing dinosaurs was, for a time, little more than a hobby that carried over from childhood. He just really liked dinosaurs, and as an artist it was a natural extension. Eventually he took a step towards turning that hobby into a career when he started submitting his work to various outlets in 1998. While still studying for his PhD, he received his first commissions to restore dinosaurs for publications and institutions like National Geographic and the Houston Museum of Natural Science. ""It was in 2005, when I got my first paleoart commissions, that I realized that I could potentially make this a career,"" he explains. His work primarily involves recreating scenes from the past, conjuring up creatures and landscapes from prehistoric times. It's a process that involves as much science as it does imagination. When illustrating dinosaurs was still a hobby for him, Csotonyi experimented with all kinds of tools, including pastels and acrylic paints. But once he started taking the art form more seriously, he realized that digital techniques were more useful when it came to accuracy. Today, his process relies heavily on photography: not only does he use images of fossils as a reference — key for getting the anatomy and structure correct — but he also takes photos of locations around the world to help aid him in crafting the elaborate scenes he paints. The forests of the Jurassic era may not exist today, but there are locations around the world that offer similar conditions where Csotonyi has traveled to gather reference photos. Places like the forests and mountains of British Colombia and the dry, arid deserts of the southwest United States offer prime material for recreating prehistoric backdrops. He's even taken underwater images in Hawaii in Mexico, building a library of some 250,000 photos. ""These are as similar to the target systems as possible,"" he says of choosing which locations to visit. ""Species may differ, but many of the same plant groups or physical and geological features are present."" Outside of photography, research also includes reading plenty of scientific journals, and when possible talking to researchers, scientists, and museum curators. The amount of research varies, depending on whether the work involves illustrating just a single animal, or an entire, complicated scene. These illustrations aren't static — given the fast pace of scientific discovery, Csotonyi often has to update pieces to coincide with new revelations. The relatively new concept of feathered dinosaurs, in particular, has changed the way he renders these prehistoric giants. ""I’ve had to return to several of my previous illustrations to update them as new information has become available based on increasingly informative fossil finds, and also because as young as my career is, I have learned to correct mistakes that I made earlier on,"" he explains. Csotonyi's work has drawn particular praise for his photorealistic style — none of us have ever seen a dinosaur in the flesh, but Csotonyi's digital paintings can make it feel like we have. ""When executed skillfully, photographic compositing can facilitate suspension of disbelief like no other medium,"" he says. Of course, some artistic flare is important, as well. Csotonyi's paintings often involve dramatic battles between prehistoric beasts, and striking silhouettes that use a delicate balance of lighting and color. That sense of drama is a necessary part of his work — it’s meant to get people excited. ""Paleoart is a very powerful way to help to convey visually to the public the excitement of paleontological discovery,"" Csotonyi says, ""and therefore to promote scientific education."" A collection of this work has been compiled in the book The Paleoart of Julius Csotonyi: Dinosaurs, Saber-Tooths, & Beyond, which is available today. There are even a few childhood dinosaur drawings showcasing his early love for the art form. His work has been featured everywhere from museums to magazines, but, as a scientist himself, there's one particular type of commission that gets him excited — illustrating newly discovered creatures. ""Even though I’ve moved from scientific research to an art career,"" he says, ""I’ll always have a passion for scientific discovery.""  A devastating moment on both land and water. One of many, backlit panels designed for the Hall of Paleontology at the Houston Museum of Natural Science. A photographic composite commissioned by the College of Charleston in South Carolina. ""This image was meant to break the unnecessary custom of nearly always showing the crocodilian-like snouted Suchomimus hunting fish of one sort or another,"" says Csotonyi.

International Sun / Earth Explorer 3 (ISEE-3), an abandoned 1970s spacecraft that once measured solar winds and flew through the tail of a comet, is headed back towards Earth. And last month, the pair of citizen scientists began an effort to make contact. After a successful crowdfunding campaign, their team is poised to take control of ISEE-3, with the chance of restarting a data-gathering mission that’s been dormant for almost 20 years. Earlier this week, the ISEE-3 Reboot project reached an official agreement with NASA, the first time the agency has approved an outside team attempting to resurrect a spacecraft that it never planned to use again. Now, Cowing, Mingo, and their team have until mid-June to fire the thrusters, diverting it into an orbit close to Earth. If they fail, ISEE-3 will swing around the Moon instead, continuing its solar orbit. It will not near Earth again for decades. ISEE-3 was launched in August of 1978, almost exactly one year after Voyager 2. Equipped with 13 sensory instruments, the craft settled around Lagrangian Point 1, a gravitational sweet spot where objects can be held in orbit directly between Earth and Sun. Over 900,000 miles away, scientists at NASA used it and two closer craft to measure solar winds. But three years later, ISEE-3 would get a new name and a new mission. Under flight director Robert Farquhar, it was dubbed the International Cometary Explorer (ICE) and sent in dizzying orbital loops towards Comet Giacobini-Zinner, which it would intercept in 1985. Though it was several years old and carried no camera, ICE would become the first craft to ever fly through a comet’s tail, beating out more sophisticated machines racing to reach Halley’s Comet. For the next several years, NASA would continue to gather data, but as ISEE-3 / ICE drifted farther from Earth, operations slowed, and the mission was officially terminated in 1997. After a brief check in 1999, communications ceased altogether. ISEE-3's orbit. Image credit: NASA Then, ISEE-3 reappeared. In 2008, the Deep Space Network found that the craft was still transmitting a signal; NASA would later explain that by the time the mission was terminated, it was simply too far away to issue shutdown commands. More importantly, it was scheduled to fly close to Earth in 2014. Originally, Farquhar and others were optimistic about at least taking control of the craft. But as the date of arrival drew near, a Goddard Space Flight Center team realized that they couldn’t even communicate with it. ""The transmitters of the Deep Space Network, the hardware to send signals out to the fleet of NASA spacecraft in deep space, no longer includes the equipment needed to talk to ISEE-3,"" said a Facebook post. ""These old-fashioned transmitters were removed in 1999. Could new transmitters be built? Yes, but it would be at a price no one is willing to spend."" That’s where amateurs and citizen scientists, including Cowing and Wingo, stepped in. After reading an interview with Farquhar, ""we just got to talking about it,"" says Cowing. ""One thing led to another, we both made some phone calls and did some calculations, and we realized that this was actually quite doable."" If they could recreate the language used to talk to the spacecraft and get access to a powerful enough radio telescope, they would be able to bring it back. ""You keep saying ‘It’ll be important someday!’ Well, it was."" Before ISEE-3 Reboot, the pair operated the Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project, a highly successful effort to recover lost photographs from 1960s lunar satellites. This experience, as well as their NASA connections, served them well: they were able to collect reference material from some of the original mission team. ""Typically, after 30 or 40 years, your wife says, ‘Why don’t you throw that crap out?’ And you keep saying ‘It’ll be important someday!’ Well, it was,"" Cowing says. ""They kept many of the documents that were required to tell the spacecraft what to do, because a lot of them knew that it was coming back to Earth in 2014."" Software-defined radio could compensate for hardware that no longer existed, making it possible to speak to ISEE-3 once again. NASA couldn’t fund a recovery mission, though it provided advice and documents to Winger and Cowing. But the public, it turned out, could. A crowdfunding campaign reached its goal of $125,000 after a month, ultimately getting over $150,000. With that money and direct equipment donations, the team got two power amplifiers and set up ground stations at Morehead State University and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, which houses the world’s largest and most powerful radio telescope. So far, they’ve detected a signal from ISEE-3, and Cowing believes they stand a very good chance of communicating with it in days or even hours. If they’re able to send it commands, they’ll ask for a status update and may alter its spin speed or orientation. Once they’re convinced it’s safe, they’ll attempt to push it towards its new orbit as soon as possible. ""The sooner we fire the thrusters, the less fuel we need,"" says Cowing. ""These engines haven’t been fired in decades, so we’d rather not fire them any longer than we have to."" As of 1999, 12 of the 13 instruments aboard were working If they can take control of ISEE-3, then what? It’s possible that it could start a new mission. As of 1999, 12 of the 13 instruments were known to be still working, and almost three-quarters of the original fuel supply remained. Though its battery is dead, the solar panels must be functioning at least enough for it to transmit a signal. Maintaining such a mission, however, would take money that the team doesn’t have right now. Instead, one of the project’s greatest findings could simply be that it’s possible to bring an abandoned spacecraft back under control, and that NASA will give its blessing to these unofficial projects. Citizen scientists of the future, for example, might want to resurrect the Spitzer space telescope, an exoplanet probe that’s facing shutdown as part of NASA budget cuts. ""People said, ‘Why don’t you take control of that?’ Well, one lost spacecraft at a time,"" says Cowing, noting that Spitzer is a more complex craft that would take more work to capture. ""But it’s only a couple million dollars a year to run these things, so all it takes is somebody with a little philanthropic intent to either write a big check or — look, we’ve raised more than a tenth of a million dollars. We’re like 10 percent of the way there to running a far more sophisticated spacecraft. So if we can do it, others can."" As NASA pursues an ambitious Mars mission in the face of constant budget crunch, Cowing hopes that everyday citizens will be able to build new spacecraft, not just commandeer old ones. He’s optimistic about the rise of cubesats, which can be made cheaply and relatively easily — though the cost of launching them is still significant. ""Smaller isn’t necessarily better, but smaller often means that you can think in different ways than if you have one big spacecraft that has everything in it. And smaller also means that you have a way to engage more people than just the traditional builders of satellites,"" he says. ""I just think it would be cool if every school in America had a class on how to build a satellite."" Despite its age, ISEE-3 itself may still have new things to teach us. Cowing and Wingo’s lunar orbiter project, for example, produces images in higher resolution than was possible in the 1960s, and this mission could do the same for space data. ""We don’t know what else we can learn from the [ISEE-3] mission. We don’t. There may be some way to analyze the signals coming back from the sensors to derive new information that nobody in the ’60s or ’70s would have ever thought to ask,"" he says. ""To me, at the end of the day — old stuff still works.""",0.6505393808718838,0.3494606191281162,0.8321758883854544,1364,4.92741935483871,689,6.0769230769230766,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It also faced off with CBS over fees, a battle which led to a blackout for TWC customers during the opening of the NFL season. TWC lost more than 300,000 customers during the month-long blackout and eventually had to surrender to CBS with egg on its face. ""Malone saw an opportunity to make an aggressive move against Time Warner,"" says Rich Greenfield, an industry analyst with BTIG Research. ""The CBS blackout was very challenging for them. But he isn’t going to get anywhere unless he makes an offer way closer to market price."" Smaller television players are struggling to compete with telecom giants like Verizon and AT&T Now that Charter has pushed TWC into the spotlight, chatter is running rampant that more bidders are circling. Consolidation is nothing new in the cable industry, which began as a highly regional affair but has increasingly become a game of scale. Smaller television players have struggled to compete with telecom giants like Verizon and AT&T, which are pushing their way into television and bundling cable with internet and mobile plans. But for Malone, it may be the best bet for survival, especially as larger rivals like Comcast are reportedly looking to swallow up smaller players like Charter and TWC. Malone’s problem is that despite its struggles, TWC’s stock is currently at an all-time high, having risen around 30 percent over the last year. In fact, his multiple aggressive overtures may be self-defeating, as persistent rumors of a takeover have helped to goose TWC’s share price in the face of its business woes. A single more generous offer when its stock was still on the ropes would have had better luck. Malone has argued that since the stock has risen on the news of his offer, the current bid is more than fair. ""We think the premium is already in the stock,"" he told The New York Times. Malone's aggressive posturing may be self-defeating Charter’s plan now is to attempt an end run around TWC’s leadership, appealing directly to shareholders in the hopes of inciting a hostile takeover. Unfortunately for Malone, there are few major independent stakeholders he could hope to win over to his side. He did appeal directly to customers, saying TWC’s notoriously bad service is responsible for its subscriber losses (coincidentally, Charter's appeal among consumers has consistently been rated as equal to or worse than TWC). In other words, even if Darth Vader gets his way, don’t expect the cable guy to start showing up on time.",0.4705643659741383,0.5294356340258617,0.8743678585074859,650,4.8292307692307697,372,5.795698924731183,0,0,"Business, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Last week, a federal court struck down the FCC's net neutrality rules — and Netflix took notice.  ""Unfortunately, Verizon successfully challenged the US net neutrality rules,"" Netflix writes in its shareholder letter. ""In principle, a domestic ISP now can legally impede the video streams that members request from Netflix, degrading the experience we jointly provide."" In a worst-case scenario, Netflix imagines a situation in which it would have to pay fees to ISPs to stop that degradation, but it sounds like the company wouldn't just sit back and let that situation happen. ""Were this draconian scenario to unfold with some ISP,"" Netflix writes, ""we would vigorously protest and encourage our members to demand the open internet they are paying their ISP to deliver."" Netflix is ready to rally its user base if need be  However, the company doesn't see that as a very likely outcome. The company feels that ISPs are likely to avoid this ""consumer-unfriendly path of discrimination"" because of ""broad public support"" for net neutrality — and because the carriers and ISPs ""don't want to galvanize government action."" Additionally, Netflix seems very aware of its position as a potential friend of the ISPs — it says that high-quality video streams (like ones that Netflix provides) are a driver of the more expensive broadband plans. That said, Netflix will definitely be keeping an eye on how ISPs respond to the new net neutrality landscape. ""In the long-term, we think Netflix and consumers are best served by strong network neutrality across all networks, including wireless,"" Netflix writes.

In Q4, the company handily beat Wall Street expectations with revenue of $1.18 billion and earnings per share of $0.79. During the same period last year (before viewers had streamed a single episode of House of Cards), Netflix earned 13 cents per share on revenue of $945 million. Ahead of today's official earnings, Wall Street estimates had landed on $1.16 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $0.65. Netflix ends the year with over 44 million customers worldwide But investors (and Netflix's competitors) are far more interested in a different number: the company's subscriber growth. Netflix added 2.33 million new domestic subscribers in Q4, bringing its total US subscriber base to 33.42 million. Factoring in international markets, that number swells even higher to over 44 million. The company's original forecast called for 1.6 million to 2.4 million new customers for the quarter. Clearly there's still room for growth, and Netflix's impressive programming lineup continues to reel in new subscribers. Still, some analysts are concerned that Netflix — now bigger than HBO — may be nearing the saturation point for home streaming. To keep current trends moving, Netflix says it's experimenting with various price points and hopes to ""offer new members a selection of three simple options to fit everyone’s taste."" Reed Hastings fires a warning shot at internet providers Another potential concern is a recent federal court ruling that struck down the FCC's net neutrality rules. That unfortunate decision thrusts Netflix into an awkward spot. The company's streaming video commands a huge percentage of internet bandwidth each and every day, and the landmark ruling effectively gives ISPs the option of charging Netflix for using their infrastructure. There's been no indication that Comcast, Time Warner Cable, or other internet providers plan to take that radical step, but Netflix isn't waiting to see their move. In his letter to shareholders, CEO Reed Hastings writes, ""we would vigorously protest and encourage our members to demand the open Internet they are paying their ISP to deliver"" if ISPs began levying extra charges on Netflix — a scenario it slams as ""draconian."" But Netflix doesn't seem phased by the ""what ifs."" The company immediately positioned itself as the leader in 4K at CES earlier this month; ultra high-def streaming will be offered on a number of TVs scheduled to ship this year. Netflix is also continuing to bolster its successful and award-winning original programing lineup. House of Cards will return for its second season in February, and Lillyhammer — the show that started Netflix's foray into original content — is coming back for a third season later this year. Turbo Fast, the animated kids series produced in tandem with DreamWorks, is on track ""to become one of the most popular kids series ever on Netflix,"" Hastings says. Perhaps the biggest question facing Netflix is where the streaming service is headed next. We should hear more on that as the year progresses, according to the shareholder letter. ""We plan later this year to embark on a substantial European expansion,"" it reads. ""Our success this year in international net additions and shrinking contribution losses confirms our belief that there is a big international opportunity for Netflix.""",0.7279192437213788,0.27208075627862116,0.860749615943276,569,5.3040421792618631,352,6.1079545454545459,0,0,"Business, Web",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Video game publisher Electronic Arts has an entire program which pays YouTube fans to promote games like Battlefield 4 and Need for Speed: Rivals. It's called Ronku, and If a report at NeoGAF is accurate, the company pays gamers quite a bit: $10 for every 1,000 views, or roughly $200,000 for an entire 20,000,000-view Battlefield 4 promotional campaign. In order to qualify for some of that money, YouTube video creators apparently have to follow specific instructions about how to promote the game.  The problem, of course, isn't that EA hit upon a fantastic way to advertise its new games. Like Microsoft, the company may not be telling YouTube video creators to disclose that they're getting paid. The Federal Trade Commission requires endorsers to ""clearly and conspicuously"" tell their audience that they're shilling for a company, but the alleged documents at NeoGAF suggest that EA expressly forbids them from doing so: While we haven't been able to independently confirm the text of a Ronku non-disclosure agreement, confirming the existence of the Ronku program itself is easy enough. The Ronku website is right here, at the Electronic Arts domain name, and its source HTML indeed describes a website that pays its members for completing assignments. Also, the URL shortlinks in the NeoGAF documents are not only real, unique, and feature in many YouTube videos that match the company's criteria, they each have URL tracking modules inside of them which mention YouTube social media campaigns. Earlier today, Microsoft argued that there was nothing special about its marketing partnership with Machinima, and Machinima said it would require all its participants to clearly disclose the promotional nature of such partnerships in future. We've contacted Electronic Arts to comment on Ronku, and we'll let you know what we hear. Update: ""Through EA's Ronku program, some fans are compensated for the YouTube videos they create and share about our games,"" a company spokesman confirms. ""The program requires that participants comply with FTC guidelines and identify when content is sponsored.  User-generated videos are a valuable and unique aspect of how gamers share their experiences playing the games they love, and one that EA supports."" When asked whether participants truly can and have disclosed their relationship in the face of any non-disclosure agreements they might have signed, EA would only say: ""We explicitly state in the Terms & Conditions of the program that each video must comply with the FTC's Guidelines concerning Use of Testimonials and Endorsements in Advertising.""",0.7133567376296096,0.2866432623703904,0.21661411150154497,439,5.2551252847380407,260,6.1076923076923073,0,0,"Business, Culture, Gaming, Policy & Law",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

""While it is true that video services like Netflix have gained, so too have premium cable channels,"" Showtime said in a statement.

""My kids started picking them up at $5 and then they went to over $1,000 and they were making all this money,"" Sommer’s wife Laura says. ""What makes gold valuable? What makes a diamond valuable? What makes anything valuable? It’s what people want."" ""What makes anything valuable? It’s what people want.""    Bitcoin is not backed by any nation; its exact origins are unknown. Some governments have passively sanctioned it, others have stayed silent, and China has banned its use. Bitcoin is also far from mature. It’s designed to have a total supply of 21 million bitcoins, but only about half of those have entered circulation so far. There is also the matter of the transaction itself. The Bitcoin protocol is designed so that anyone can transfer any number of bitcoins to another person directly, without any third parties or fees — it’d be like handing over a suitcase with $7.85 million in cash. That won’t fly with a large real estate transaction — taxes and brokers’ fees must be paid in dollars and there is normally a 30-day escrow period, an eternity in the volatile Bitcoin market. In order to accommodate the oddball currency, Sommer expects he would write a contract denominated in US dollars with reference to the equivalent amount in Bitcoin as well as a minimum and maximum range in order to hedge against wild price changes. Other than that, it wouldn’t be much different than accepting euro or yen for the house. The gesture is a bit of a stunt The gesture is a bit of a marketing stunt — since advertising the Bitcoin angle, the Sommers have been swamped with interest from media and, to a lesser degree, potential buyers. They have had some Bitcoiners ""sniffing around,"" including one who was interested in paying in a mix of currencies, which the Sommers are perfectly happy with. ""It could be a blend,"" Jack says. ""Part cash, part bit. Why not?"" Sommer is bullish on Bitcoin, but he’s also cautious. ""I intend to eliminate the risks to the greatest extent possible,"" he says. Keeping that much money in Bitcoin would be too risky because of the chance of government interference or a market crash, so Sommer plans to convert the majority of the sum into dollars and keep perhaps $100,000 or more in Bitcoin for speculative purposes. He’s not actually the first to offer real estate for Bitcoin; one Canadian woman offered her home for $1 million in the virtual currency and another Canadian man offered his home for $395,000 in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is increasingly accepted by merchants around the world, including two Vegas casino hotels, Richard Branson’s commercial space flight venture Virgin Galactic, and at least one college. Still, it’s far from mainstream. ""It’s actually good that not that many people know about it, because that means there are many more people who are going to know about it,"" Sommer says. ""I think that it is graduating to become a trend. And hopefully it will sustain itself — at least until we sell the house.""",0.664918551765368,0.33508144823463204,0.8283784713786865,688,4.8880813953488369,380,5.9236842105263161,1,0,"Business, Report, Videos",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Now, four months later, those maps are complete, and the search is beginning anew this month as three ships plan to scour the search area for debris by dragging a sensor device just 330 feet (100 meters) above the seabed at a speed of seven miles per hour, according to the Associated Press. The device, known as a towfish, is equipped with sonar to produced detailed imagery of the ocean floor, and they are tethered to the ships with six-mile cables. They also have jet fuel sensors on board, and crews can lift the devices and attach a video camera to investigate regions of particular interest.

The music sharing service has been dealt what could easily amount to a death blow by a US District Court judge, which found that Grooveshark's own employees personally (and willfully) violated and profited from copyright infringement. It's been a long saga; Grooveshark has faced lawsuit after lawsuit in recent years. It's managed to overcome some by striking deals with publishers, but vengeful music labels haven't given up on sinking the company. Most recently, Grooveshark had tried to seek protection under the ""safe harbor"" provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. It took on a Google-like approach when responding to takedown notices by taking down unauthorized files mentioned in those complaints. But US District Judge Thomas Griesa essentially wiped out that possibility in his opinion filed on Monday, and Grooveshark's own employees are to blame. Collectively, they uploaded some 5,977 tracks to the service — without the necessary licensing rights to do so — under the orders of CTO and co-founder Joshua Greenberg. Way back in 2007, Greenberg demanded that his workers help the cause by sharing their own MP3s, obtained from who knows where, on the service. Download as many MP3’s as possible, and add them to the folders you’re sharing on Grooveshark.

That library now stands at over million songs, and Grooveshark has tallied some 20 million users since launch. There have been blips of hope; the company has managed to reach agreements with some publishers and labels to share their music legally, but not with the major labels determined to sue it out of existence. If that evidence weren't damning enough, Griesa also found that Grooveshark deleted data crucial to the case, including documents listing uploaded files — likely in an attempt to save itself.

But perhaps the most exciting projects for city residents are two new extensions to the vast New York City Subway — one to the far West Side, and another down Second Avenue. The Subway is New York's lifeline; it's a transportation system so vital, that the city itself wouldn't exist as we know it if the Subway were never built. And these two extensions are severely needed. City planners first started work on the Second Avenue Subway in 1929, and while the project has legendarily been stuck in a quagmire for a quarter of a century, today residents need it more than ever. And it's coming to life. The scale of these projects is truly incredible, and what's even more amazing is that it's all happening in one of the most crowded spots on earth.

A man had been attempting to dial emergency responders, but he couldn't get through. He was left listening to a ""fast busy"" — a pre-recorded tone. Eventually, he made contact by borrowing someone else's phone. The staff of the state's Vancouver call center, where the call was received, began investigating what might have prevented the call from going through. They made test calls with Sprint phones, the same provider the man had. No 911 service. They had someone in another location make more calls. Same problem. About 100 miles north, in another county, emergency responders began getting similar reports. The Vancouver center sent a message to call centers in other counties, and out of seven that responded, five reported back: no 911 service on Sprint. Leneweaver attempted to track down Sprint employees about the outage, but couldn't reach anyone at the company. The outage, which also affected Verizon customers and callers in Oregon, ended hours later without a response. Leneweaver was angry — couldn't Sprint alert emergency responders if there was an outage? He sent a complaint to the FCC: ""Sprint provided no notification and neither the counties effected [sic] or the State E911 Coordinator's Office had adequate contact information for Sprint,"" he wrote. Two weeks later, Leneweaver got in touch with the company. (""They know who I am now,"" he says.) A subcontractor was performing a network patch, which killed the 911 connection in parts of the state. ""It definitely was planned,"" he says, ""or it wasn't planned and they didn't bother to tell us."" He hasn't heard back from the FCC on the complaint. Wireless carriers have a strong incentive to play down any 911 outages Wireless carriers have a strong incentive to play down any 911 outages: no company wants be the one that fails to send emergency calls. The FCC, meanwhile, receives a steady stream of complaints from consumers, according to documents obtained by The Verge through a Freedom of Information Act request, and reserves enforcement for the most egregious infractions. Years into the slow demise of the landline and ubiquity of the smartphone, it seems, calling 911 on mobile is a much riskier move than from a wired phone. Leneweaver's team tried canvassing the counties to see if anyone was injured because of the outage. As far as they could tell, no one was; but, he says, ""it only takes one to make the evening news.""  Since January 1st, 2011, more than 400 formal consumer complaints about wireless 911 calls have been sent to the FCC. In that time, fines have been incurred just twice, both for landline phone services. They resulted from tips sent to the commission by 911 operators; none of the consumer complaints have resulted in fines. Reading them, you start following patterns: there's an accident, an emergency; 911 ends with a busy signal; occasionally, someone’s hurt. Most frequently, the issue is poor network coverage — a person in a remote area who only has access to a mobile phone can't reach emergency responders. In one, a woman from Buffalo, Kentucky, attempts to call 911 on T-Mobile about an emergency with her 17-month-old daughter. According to the complaint, multiple calls failed. When she asked T-Mobile, they couldn't tell her why. Many are technical glitches with unclear resolutions. One person wrote, after a fire, that they called 911 fives times. ""The next day I called Verizon and explained what happened. By mistake they told me they had me pinging off of their towers only; thus I could not access any other towers."" ""By mistake they told me they had me pinging off of their towers only; thus I could not access any other towers."" At an August 6th speech in New Orleans, FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel told the audience, ""I learned that in the city of Little Rock if you call 911 using your wireless phone in the corner of the 911 call center your call will not get routed to Little Rock. Instead, it will be answered by a 911 call center in North Little Rock all the way on the other side of the Arkansas River."" It may not have been an isolated issue. The year before, in Ada Township, Michigan, this complaint was made from someone with AT&T: While many of the complaints focus on general service outages — people writing to say they wouldn't be able to call 911 in a theoretical emergency — others say they were caught off guard when they tried to dial. After an incident, some were afraid to dial as a test. Those that aren't able to call frequently report that they've asked to be relieved of their service contracts — and have been denied. The FCC files 911 consumer complaints into two categories: the immediately life-threatening, and the not immediately life-threatening. The former, the agency says, are swiftly handled. The rest take longer. Complaints are sent to the service providers, and the FCC decides whether to investigate based on the response. The complaints that are investigated aren't the pernicious ones, but the ones that willingly flout FCC rules. The last time a wireless carrier received a fine was T-Mobile, in 2007; both examples since early 2011 were incurred by wireline services, in what the commission apparently considered flagrant infractions. ""It took nearly one minute for the operator to realize she could not find my address, etc., and I had the wrong 911."" Occasionally, a problem is so extensive that inquiries are opened. Two months before Leneweaver's complaint, a 911 outage hit eight states. It was centered in Washington. There alone, 4,500 calls failed to connect during the six-hour outage. Problems like that are difficult to track: the FCC accepts anonymized information on outages, then protects that information from public disclosure, as the data is potentially harmful ""to both national security and commercial competitiveness."" No service providers are directly named in the inquiry announcement. The FCC is now considering new rules that may curb a related problem: location tracking. Rules that haven't been updated since 2010 require phone carriers to track a caller's location to within 50 to 300 meters, depending on the tracking technology used, when callers are outdoors. But 911 advocates have been arguing that the technology to track callers indoors is lacking. If you make a call inside, no current regulations are forcing carriers to deliver information on where you are. The FCC has said ""indoor use poses unique obstacles."" Meanwhile, for purposes unrelated to public safety, other private-sector companies are zipping ahead of wireless carriers in location tracking, largely thanks to Wi-Fi accuracy. Google provides tracking data everywhere you go; more than telling you where you are at a moment, the company can chart your entire location history. Engineers there are reportedly working on tracking devices down to inches. Apple’s Find My iPhone function has proved accurate enough to track lost devices across cities. Companies like Skyhook Wireless have been built around the idea. But telecoms and emergency responders, caught off guard by the rise of the mobile, have failed to catch up to those companies, as Richard Barnes and Brian Rosen explain in a history of 911 tracking at IEEE Spectrum. Carriers have been fighting new regulations The new regulations could help. Within two years, under the new regulations, providers would have to track callers to within 50 meters horizontally and 3 meters vertically for 67 percent of calls. Within five years, 80 percent of calls would need to have accurate indoor location information. Carriers have been fighting those regulations, as they have attempted several times to forcefully regulate 911 calls. The major providers have argued that the regulations would be overly difficult to put in place, and that better technology is right around the corner. They've argued, essentially, that tracking indoor calls is a solution in search of a problem. AT&T called the solution a ""waste of scarce resources."" FindMe911, an industry-funded group leading the charge for the regulations, has been a source of ire in FCC filings from carriers. T-Mobile wrote, ""FindMe911 continues to push sensationalist headlines rather than facts as it tries to manufacture a crisis that simply does not exist."" Verizon chimed in, writing, ""While improvements in location estimates may be feasible in the future, experience shows that any such improvements will continue to diminish over time."" ""It's a great concern to us that the carriers won't even acknowledge that it's a problem."" ""It's a great concern to us that the carriers won't even acknowledge that it's a problem,"" FindMe911's Andrew Weinstein argues. Dispatchers and others working in the 911 community agree with Weinstein; they say it's a continuous issue that's resulting in deaths across the country, maybe thousands. ""The question is, how many lives do we have to lose?"" says Danita Crombach, the president of the California chapter of NENA, the National Emergency Number Association. Crombach and a team conducted a study that determined more than half of 911 calls placed in California don't provide accurate 911 information. In San Francisco, the numbers were particularly dismal: more than 80 percent of 911 calls didn't accurately transmit information to first responders. In FCC filings, service providers have disputed the study's findings. Verizon and Sprint didn’t respond to requests for comment on this story; T-Mobile declined to comment. In August of last year, Vicki Miller, 911 coordinator for the city of Galesburg, Illinois, was upset with a company called Life Wireless. When a call is put through to 911 operators, they ""rebid"" the call, pinging the wireless carrier for the longitude and latitude of the caller. But one day, she says, that wasn't what happened. A caller with a severe medical condition attempted to make a call with a phone from Life Wireless, a carrier that specializes in prepaid phones. He wasn't able to tell emergency responders his location. When they digitally asked for position data, it was wrong, Miller says; the number plotted inaccurately, far away from where they eventually found the caller. ""Upon calling Life Wireless on 08/23/13 was told they do not have the ability to complete trace information for 911..."" Miller, frustrated, tried contacting Life Wireless to determine what the problem was. According to a complaint she filed after the conversation, and what she later recalled, a representative with the company told her Life Wireless didn't have the ability to track location information, but that they would look into the issue. Miller wrote to the FCC: ""Upon calling Life Wireless on 08/23/13 was told they do not have the ability to complete trace information for 911 and took name and number for their supervisor. For 9-1-1 purposes — we need to find out how to fix the location information as well as who do we contact in an emergency situation for trace location and customer subscriber information."" Per FCC protocol, Life Wireless was sent the complaint, and it was later determined that the issue was resolved, although Miller wasn't certain how. ""I had kind of had my fill with it and I decided I'd file a complaint,"" she says, ""but honestly nothing ever came of it."" She escalated the issue with Life Wireless. Eventually, she says, she received a note from the company. ""We do not give out confidential information without a subpoena or a court order,"" it said. Miller didn't have either, and that was the last communication they had. Now, a year later, she says, problems with tracking callers are a daily issue. It's difficult to pin the incidents on any specific service provider — many share towers, or ""ride a different carrier's backbone"" — but it keeps happening. ""Everyone assumes that they know immediately where they're at and that's not always so."" Although the FCC requires tracking for outdoor calls, she says, ""Some carriers are much better than others."" ""This is an ongoing thing on the 911 side of life.""

It's a piece that's somehow become the go-to ""magic of cinema"" theme, due to its frequent use in ""magic of cinema"" montages in awards show telecasts and other settings in which the art of filmmaking needs to be defended or justified. Saint-Saëns' tinkling, undulating piano line, originally written to capture the flickering of underwater light, has now been repurposed to capture the flickering of light through a film projector.  It's a theme that, for a moment, can make you forget mainstream cinema's crippling franchise addiction, the crass tabloid dissection of the lives of actors, the focus groups and studio notes that try at every turn to revive the elusive myth of the auteur. It can make you believe in the sublime art of storytelling through light and sound, the god-like ability and extremely human desire to share the experiences of life on earth. I first hear this theme as I'm standing outside in the sweltering late afternoon sun, waiting to pick up my press badge. The Croisette is in full crush mode for the red carpet arrivals for the festival's opening ceremony, which is taking place about 50 feet away. Tourists pose for pictures in front of vacant step-and-repeat banners, girls in cheap department store prom dresses stand along the sidewalk holding tattered signs begging for screening ""invitations"" — ""1 Invitation SVP Merci"" they all read, without fail. Stocky paparazzi, wearing the same cargo-shorts-black-logo-tee uniform they wear on the scummiest corners of Hollywood Boulevard, lug their gear down the sidewalk in search of that perfect shot to sell to an Italian tabloid. Then ""The Aquarium"" fades away and is followed by the thump of Die Antwoord's ""I Fink You Freaky."" Welcome to Cannes, the most glamorous film festival in the world. Film festivals in general enjoy a kind of unspoiled aura of excitement and importance to people who have never been to one, despite the fact that most of them primarily consist of long lines and dark rooms. But in the popular American imagination at least, Cannes in particular has remained in a kind of rarefied continental bubble, a place where the integrity of a director's vision (always a director, Cannes subscribes to the controversial ""by"" when crediting directors in its lineup schedule) cannot only remain intact, but can be lauded with a level of pomp usually reserved for royalty or Beyoncé. Depending on your point of view, that's either antiquated and precious, or a rare kind of paradise. But it’s not immune to the more craven aspects of celebrity and spectacle, and while the voracity of the European tabloid industry is well documented, for some reason the wire photos that make it back to the blogs from the Croisette every May always seem to leave the throngs of gawking fans out of the frame. Unlike American festivals, there is no populist attitude baked into the official festival. Screenings are open only to those carrying a spectrum of different colored, specifically coded badges, and even press like myself have to jump through all kinds of Kafkaesque hoops to finagle an ""invitation"" for the higher-profile screenings. (God forbid anyone refer to the printed card with a tear-off stub at the end of this search as a ""ticket"" — that would imply that it was something just any commoner could acquire with a fistful of euros, rather than a privilege for a certain echelon of society.) This carefully cultivated air of exclusivity, now 68 years in the making, only fuels the intensity of the mob outside, who have to content themselves with the generalized, watered-down theme of ""movies!"" that fills the cheap souvenir kiosks the further you wander from the Palais. In the lawn by the theater you can buy €3 Italian ices and pose behind a cutout of Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean. Nothing like that would ever fly at Sundance, which proudly opens its doors to local Utah residents every year. Yet somehow, Cannes is the only film festival I've been to with a full body check at the door of every screening. (Ben A. Pruchnie / Getty Images) My first invitation, and my first screening of my first Cannes film festival, is for Tale of Tales, Matteo Garrone's (Gomorrah) surreal fairytale starring Salma Hayek, Vincent Cassel, and John C. Reilly. From my balcony seat way up in the rafters of the stadium-like Grand Lumière theater, I have to look down at the screen as the Saint-Saëns starts again, and an animation of a floating red carpet staircase ascends to the starry heavens. There is nothing cool, funky, or irreverent about this opening animation, which runs before every screening at the festival. We are here to watch movies, because movies are humanity's most glamorous and noble pursuit. Tale of Tales is pretty glamorous, if not exactly noble. At one point Vincent Cassel stumbles through a grotto full of naked women and kicks a peacock into a fountain. The magic of movies! I had been curious about what tone Garrone would take: if it would be one long tongue-in-cheek goof, or if the lavish set pieces, many of which look like they were pulled straight from a Vogue Italia editorial spread, would read as heavy-handed and disconnected from reality. In the end it's neither: fully aware of its ridiculousness and embracing it without much in the way of apology. In that way, it was the perfect first Cannes screening. It's certainly the best film I've ever seen in which Salma Hayek eats the heart of a sea monster. This morning, I saw an equally strange, equally admirable film, The Lobster, a dryer-than-dry future dystopia farce that takes place in a world where it is a crime to be single. Both of these films starred well-known talent (Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz in this case, along with Reilly — again! Dude's having an interesting year, for sure) and are clearly not shoestring budget affairs, but they manage to feel like pretty unfettered dispatches from the wild and weird brains of their creators. In a way, Cannes seems like welcome counter-programming to the festivals I've attended earlier this year. Unlike Sundance and South by Southwest, there is no exhibition of the latest experiments in VR filmmaking here, no newfangled streaming platforms making their big debut. The parties are sponsored by Perrier-Jouet, not Hulu. Netflix suits are heckled here as badly as a Von Trier film. Everyone seems to be content to dig their Louboutin heels into the sand in defense of a very old-school, very French way of doing movies. The fact that the festival has a reputation for having the highest-quality program in the world is probably not coincidental. On Thursday night though, after a day of writing, I couldn't help but drag myself to a DJ party on the beach sponsored by Magnum Ice Cream, where the still formal-dressed guests of that evening's screenings gathered to kick off their aforementioned heels and dance awkwardly to wedding-grade '80s dance hits, lubricated by free-flowing, top-shelf champagne and a custom ice cream bar station. Hashtag-branded banners hung behind the stage, and in between tracks, everyone stopped and took out their phones to check their messages. Brand ambassadors dressed in pink wandered around bumming smokes from guests as everyone put their hands up and sang along to ""Empire State of Mind."" It was a little silly, it was very fancy, it was fully indecipherable.

Okay. Ready? Maybe new voice actors are the best thing that could happen to The Simpsons. This is heresy I love the show. I'm one of those people who still regularly watches the show. The worst part about the show isn't the scripts, which have steadily improved from its creative nadir a decade ago. Nor is it the animation, which thanks to computers and outside artists has become one of the strangest, most impressive examples of the craft on television. The worst — or let's just say most disappointing — aspect of The Simpsons today is the voice work. The Simpsons has one of the finest voice casts, if not the finest voice cast, ever assembled. But they're phoning it in — literally. This has been happening for sometime, but this week Al Jean commented on the process in an interview about voice actor Harry Shearer (Flanders, Mr. Burns) with Entertainment Weekly: ""He actually gets to record on the phone and do the [table] reads on the phone. So we've never kept him from doing that stuff. So that's one confusion I had. For the last several years, he's done reads on the phone. He doesn't always participate. We've excused him for several and he records, as long as it's done in time, when it's convenient for him."" If you've watched The Simpsons in the past couple years, the disinterest and disconnect of some of its cast is audible. Many jokes feel like first takes, and characters reactions to one another sound like parts of different conversations. But the worst crime is the lack of faith in the show's jokes. The worst part about  The Simpsons isn't the scripts Who can't relate? The actors voiced iconic characters through their golden years, then continued to do so for 15 more years. They have a relationship with the show and its scripts, and like all relationships this one is built upon trust. When an actor stops trusting that scripts will be good, she or he might mentally check out. Multiply that by 250 or so subpar episodes of a 573-episode run, and you get why someone like Harry Shearer or Nancy Cartwright would see recordings as an obligation instead of an opportunity. These days the show has decent scripts again, but that trust between actors and writers seems to be gone. And the result is tepid delivery of jokes that could and should land. Then there's the sad reality that many characters already sound as if they're performed by impersonators, thanks to age and presumably the damaging effect throwing your voice day after day may have on one's vocal chords. What I'm saying is sacrilege! It's heresy! It's the words of a scoundrel! And the nostalgic, sentimental part of me — the part that loves the early seasons of this very show — would probably rather watch The Simpsons end poorly with its original cast, than hobble a couple more years with a band of replacements. But let's not delude ourselves into thinking the voice actors aren't in some part to blame for the show's decline. Maybe what's best for the show is to recognize it's now a cultural myth, or visual language, that's more than its talent. And that it's time to hand it over wholesale to people who can try something new.",0.4871204149691139,0.512879585030886,0.1743414537532374,590,4.6406779661016948,332,5.6265060240963853,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Of course, The Avengers are hardly the first selection of superheroes to band together, but for viewers whose only exposure to comic book superheroes has come via TV and movies, some of Legends of Tomorrow's stars appear on first glance to have borrowed particularly liberally from Marvel's crew. The Atom, in particular, shares traits with not one but two of DC's rival's creations — using his red metal suit, ex-Superman actor Brandon Routh can both fly like Iron Man, and shrink like Ant-Man. Legends of Tomorrow premieres early next year But there are some distinct differences. Where Tony Stark has both charm and smarm in equal measures, The Atom, is almost dopey and eager to please. The Legends also have one up on the Avengers in terms of gender parity, featuring two female characters in Hawk Girl and resurrected assassin White Canary. Importantly, the show is set to beat Marvel's own small-screen superhero team — The Defenders — to air, something of a victory for DC as the competing comic companies work to flesh out live action versions of their own intricate universes with movies and TV shows. The show should also benefit from featuring Arrow and The Flash, two heroes who've established themselves in their own successful shows. Their success has allowed The CW to renew both for the fall season, keeping both Arrow and the The Flash in their current positions on Tuesdays and Wednesdays  in the process.

The Bay Area electronic artist will release her sophomore LP Platform next week, and though lyrics are sparse, the album has an obvious theme: with technology comes conflict. A MacBook is great at hosting audio workstations, but Apple's labor practices are questionable, at best. Software can create sounds no instrument can make, but it can also be the target of unwanted cybersurveillance. Herndon was born in Johnson City, Tennessee, and says she was ""terrified"" of computers growing up. ""We didn’t have any extensive technical training,"" she said when I met up with her in New York City recently. Herndon moved to Berlin as a teenager, and when she returned to the States to study at Mills University in California, the city’s experimental influence stuck with her. Platform is a collage of brain-bending sounds: bursting bubbles, wet sand scraped against metal, a stretchy yawn, the squeak of a sneaker against a spitty wad of bubblegum. Herndon has been making electronic music for years without much more than a laptop, but Platform is so packed, it sounds like it could’ve been made by an entire orchestra. And, in a way, it was: Herndon collaborated with several visual artists and musicians, plus built her own software, in order to create all the sounds that ended up on the album. ""I often think about tracks in a visual, maybe sculptural, or weighted way,"" she said. ""Things like sounds moving through space.""  That the album is called Platform is just further proof of Herndon’s fractured processing of technology's physical and linguistic clatter. It’s an album obsessed with the heavy omnipresence of the future — and the idea that what we call futurism is actually happening now. Throughout Platform, Herndon toys with the sounds and imagery of daily life that can sound alien when taken out of context. Even though the album is made up of a lot of sounds you’ve probably heard before, the lack of context will usually render them unrecognizable. ""One day I was playing a track,"" Herndon said, ""and [collaborator Mat Dryhurst] slammed the door of the refrigerator and there was a vase on top that jiggled. It sounded perfect at the moment that I was playing the song, so I just ran in there and recorded that."" ""Sounds moving through space."" Herndon says she likes the idea of filling her songs with ""browsing sounds"" (i.e. clicking around on the internet) and ""mundane domestic sounds."" Platform has Herndon experimenting with field recordings collected from her daily life. ""Chorus"" feels like a puzzle that just slightly obfuscates everyday sounds: a pack of cards being shuffled, a screen door slamming. ""Locker Leak,"" created with artist Spencer Longo, relies on word clusters to give the listener that moment of recognition: ""Grass lasts longest,"" ""A friendly first,"" ""Be the first of your friends to like Greek yogurt this summer,"" ""Our liquor special/aloe vera."" In the background there’s a sound like a jawbreaker knocking against teeth. Herndon teamed up with Amsterdam-based design firm Metahaven to make Platform, and the firm's heightened political aesthetic wriggled its way into much of the album. There’s a tension in Platform between Herndon's reliance on technology and her cautious distrust of it. ""I think people oversimplify our relationship to technology, and I don’t want it to be a black-or-white thing,"" Herndon said. ""I want people to see technology as an extension of our society, as human knowledge and motivations. So you’re gonna have the worst and the best in there."" There’s a track on Platform called ""Home"" that Herndon has called a ""love song to the NSA."" In it, whispers build hauntingly as dry foil crunches in tandem with padded thuds. The lyrics break and stumble: ""Why was I assigned to you?... I can feel you in my room."" Then the percussion gurgles out of the space, as if from one of those dental suction tools hooked to an unwilling mouth. The song suddenly feels empty, and you’re left with an eerie feeling that you've missed something important. The inspiration for the song came from a nagging sense Herndon got while working in her studio that someone was watching her. She says she worries about mass surveillance changing the behaviors of humans. ""I do sometimes see that I’m editing myself, in emails, or on the phone, because I’m not sure if I’m caught in the algorithm or whatever,"" she said. Herndon says she likes the idea of using pop music to bring attention to issues that people tend to forget about, either due to ignorance or laziness. She brings up a recent episode of Last Week Tonight that featured NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. ""Everyone was saying, ‘Oh, that’s the Wikileaks guy,’"" she said. ""I was like, ‘Nooo, it’s not.’""  But Platform isn’t an academic lesson disguised in unlikely synthetic patterns. Herndon admits there’s an ""element of alien"" to the album, and that’s likely because the sounds on it don’t come from classic instruments. And, unlike a lot of popular electronic music, there's no synth stabs, no breath-holding builds, no drops. Herndon made the album in a ""semi-mobile"" way — that means makeshift vocal booths in hotel room closets — using both off-the-shelf and DIY software. ""I’m not the kind of person who’s like, ‘I love software.’ I don’t love it, but I like it when I have an idea and I can sketch it out,"" Herndon said. ""It’s nice when you don’t have to rely on the flow or the aesthetic of the company that designed the software."" Not that it's likely Herndon would be tempted to rely on anyone else's aesthetic. The Top 40 formula doesn't interest her, but she recognizes there's comfort in a pop song. For Herndon, it's not about getting listeners out of their comfort zones, but rather redefining what a comfort zone can be. ""I don’t want to revert back to a nostalgic, traditional space,"" Herndon said. ""I like the idea of working with things that have entry points for people, but having a new fantasy. We don’t have to recreate something old for it to touch people."" Correction, 11:13 AM ET: This post originally misspelled the name of Herndon's collaborator, Mat Dryhurst. We regret the error.

The story is all about humans fighting against towering giants using something called ""omni-directional mobility gear,"" which essentially lets them swing around like Spider-Man. It's basically a series of boss battles that require crazy-fast aerial acrobatics, which sounds like a recipe for a great game. But the new Nintendo 3DS adaptation of the series doesn't live up to that. The anime takes place in a grim alternate reality where humanity is at the brink of extinction thanks to an inexplicable menace: giant creatures called titans that look like naked humans and like to eat people for fun. The humans who are still alive cower inside a heavily barricaded city. The thing about titans is that not only are they big and hungry, but they're also very difficult to kill. They can regenerate limbs almost instantly, and their only vulnerable point is a small weak spot on the back of their necks — sort of like a video game boss. In order to fight this menace, human soldiers train for years and use a combination of the omni-directional gear and a pair of swords to take down their foes. They don't usually succeed. Most battle scenes in the show involve huge massacres, where human survivors are rare. Taking down titans is incredibly boring and tedious The combination of terrifying enemies and a thrilling sense of movement is what had me excited about the Attack on Titan game. Titles like Sunset Overdrive have shown that simply moving around can be fun if done right, and the premise of Attack on Titan has that same potential. Unfortunately, swinging through the city makes you feel less like Spider-Man, and more like a window washer tumbling down a building. The controls are cumbersome and the camera is disorienting; often I'd launch a grappling hook and speed over to a location, only to find the camera would spin around so that I wasn't quite sure which direction I was headed. To make matters worse, what should be the best part of the game — taking down titans — proves to be incredibly boring and tedious. Instead of a thrilling battle, it's more of a paint-by-numbers experience where you have to take out a titan's legs to knock them down, and then swing up to hit them in the back of the head. It's the same every time, and never particularly thrilling.   The game tries to mix things up a bit by adding in different objectives. Sometimes you'll be rescuing citizens, other times you'll need to take down a specific number of titans. One quest has you running around the city as the perpetually hungry Sasha Blouse in search of steamed potatoes. But the side objectives are even less interesting than the core combat. Even the scenes where you get to take control of a titan to fight other titans are inexplicably dull. Really, there are very few moments in the game that could be considered fun, which is insanely disappointing. To make things even worse, there is little bonus material for fans of the show to dig into. The story the game tells is exactly the same as the anime, to the point that the in-game cut scenes are ripped directly from the show. You get to play as different characters, five in total, but you don't get any new insight into them or the world they inhabit. And if you're coming into the series fresh, the story is so chopped up that I have a hard time believing you'll understand anything. In the amount of time it would take to play through the entire game, you could watch most of the show on Netflix, and that would be a much better use of your time. It's probably not surprising that the game is bad. With a few notable exceptions, games based on movies and TV shows tend to skew toward awful. But there's just so much promise in Attack on Titan that I can't help but be disappointed. There are so many aspects of the series that feel like they would translate perfectly to a game, but instead we get this bland mess. Maybe someday we'll get that amazing Attack on Titan game. Until then, there are always Minecraft mods.",0.3385648507396821,0.6614351492603179,0.16136844636844636,730,4.6054794520547944,388,5.7809278350515463,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Games Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

This week's trailer releases were all about television, with the biggest networks releasing first looks at their fall lineups. That means there's a ton of new shows to check out. Not surprisingly, there are a lot of superheroes and a lot of crime dramas, but it definitely seems like there are some gems in the mix. You can check out the 14 best trailers of the week below, nearly all of which are for TV shows.   True Detective was the buzziest show on television when its first season was airing last year, and there's a good chance that's going to happen again come June 21st. True Detective's second season is getting close to its premiere, and this week HBO finally put out a real trailer for it. It's short — just one minute — but it's surprisingly tense right from the start.   Minority Report is getting something like a sequel on TV, though it isn't keeping much more than the sci-fi premise. Rather than dealing with the ethical problems brought up in the film, the TV adaptation dives right into how great it is to predict crimes. The show definitely has the look of a typical crime drama, but it seems like Minority Report's premise could still make for a good twist on a stale genre. It'll be on Fox this fall.   Let's get this straight: CBS' Supergirl isn't necessarily for the people watching Gotham. It's for people interested in superpowers and really interested in the person behind them. That makes Supergirl very different from other superhero shows, and that's a good thing. It's bringing superheroes to another audience, and it's actually taking an interesting approach to them. There are some (intentionally) very silly moments in this trailer, but there's a lot to like about them.   The Muppets are coming back to TV — and they're well aware of it. The first trailer for ABC's new Muppets has the classic characters all discussing their comeback and what it should look like. In short: as self-aware and funny as you'd expect. It arrives on ABC this fall.   Fox is only giving a short look at Scream Queens, but it's enough to show off one surprisingly stylish show. Naturally there's screaming — after all, there may be a killer on the loose — but it's not quite what you'd expect. The combination of Glee and American Horror Story actually seems kind of great. It'll start to air this fall.   This isn't quite the Jem and the Holograms you remember — at least, if you remember the old ’80s cartoon. The film adaptation has a very different story for a very different audience, about a singer who rises to fame on YouTube and then adopts a slick persona as her fame reaches new heights. There's some cool style in the mix, and while the music and dialogue clearly makes this targeted for a teen audience, it looks like it could make for an interesting coming of age story.   Here's something that people are bound to be talking about this fall: a show about con artists that happens to be the latest work from Shonda Rhimes. Basically, that means this is going to be worth checking out. It'll be on ABC.   It's no Minority Report, but Limitless is the second sci-fi movie this year that's getting turned into a TV series. Bradley Cooper, briefly, reprises his role from the film to introduce the show's star to a pill that can make him insanely smart. Naturally, as with all network dramas, he somehow ends up helping solve crimes. It's arriving this fall.   Okay, this is kind of like NBC threw together Prison Break and John Doe and came up with a premise based on their coolest parts. Blindspot is about a woman who wakes up with encoded tattoos all over her body, with no specific memory of her prior life, and with the ability to speak multiple languages and perform martial arts. Sweet? Kind of. It starts this fall.   Lucifer is yet another comic book adaptation heading to TV. As you can probably guess, it's about the devil — but what the devil actually does in this show is kind of still anyone's guess. The character heads to Earth in a man's body where it seems like he solves crimes and uses his evil powers to flirt with women and make bad jokes. He's the devil! He's edgy! The series is still a bit of a ways out, arriving in 2016.   CW brings together its two existing superheroes to kick off a new show about an entire team of them. It looks like what you'd expect from a CW show, meaning it's a little low-budget and hokey — and not exactly in the slightly subversive way that Supergirl is. Still, The Flash and Arrow appear to be doing well, so don't count out Legends of Tomorrow. The show will start sometime next year.   Netflix's next big series is a semi-apocalyptic story about a town where everyone under the age of 22 is being killed off by a strange plague. It's basically a young adult apocalypse series — something it's safe to guess that there's a very big audience for. It's hard to tell how it'll turn out just from this trailer, but it seems like a solid start. It'll be out next Thursday.   Guillermo del Toro's latest film just looks delightfully spooky. This new trailer seems to run through a lot of the movie, but it shows a film that's more concerned with creating a rich and creepy world than individual scares — something that's far too uncommon. The cast — Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston, and Jessica Chastain — is pretty incredible as well. It opens October 16th.   The Wolfpack picked up the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, and this trailer makes it easy to see why. The documentary is about a truly sad and strange situation, a group of kids locked away in an apartment who learned about the world through the movies they watched and reenacted. It enters theaters on June 12th.",0.6317954727343265,0.36820452726567354,0.16934111060281898,1064,4.4633458646616537,509,5.6286836935166997,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Film",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

There's also the matter of audio quality — you might think that all of these services would deliver the exact same digital stream to your ears, but you'd be wrong. Tidal's claim to fame is that it delivers true lossless streams at 1.4Mbps — legitimate CD quality, for all practical purposes — while Spotify tops out at 320kbps. Apple Music runs at a slightly lower 256kbps, but it uses a better encoding scheme, AAC, than Spotify's Ogg Vorbis. (Note that in the video, I misidentify it as MP3, but the two sound very similar, especially at higher bitrates.) But what does this all actually mean in the real world? We wanted to find out, so we put a bunch of Vox Media staff in front of the camera for a blind test between Spotify, Tidal, and Apple Music. The methodology was straightforward: subjects listened to the same segment of the same song back-to-back on all three services set to their maximum streaming bitrates. We used Sony's MDR-7506 headphones — selected for their popularity, neutral sound, and non-outrageous price tag — paired to an iPhone 6 Plus. Subjects judged a total of three songs covering a spectrum of genres and audio characteristics: Kendrick Lamar's ""Complexion (A Zulu Love),"" St. Vincent's ""Digital Witness,"" and Aaron Copland's ""Fanfare for the Common Man"" off the Copland Conducts Copland compilation. After listening to each song, we asked them to just say whatever was on their mind — if one service sounded notably better, notably worse, or if all three were about the same.  The results were very, very surprising to me The results were very, very surprising to me. It was generally random across the board, though Spotify fared slightly worse than Apple Music and Tidal overall. In roughly 29 percent of the tests, subjects couldn't tell any notable difference at all. Tidal — which wants you to pay more for lossless quality — most definitely didn't take the crown, and in several cases, subjects actually identified it as the worst-sounding of the three. What are the takeaways? Having been a longtime Tidal subscriber and run blind tests on my laptop between Tidal and Spotify in the past, it seems possible that the difference in quality is particularly irrelevant when you're using your phone — maybe it's one thing to use better components, headphones, and speakers, but a phone's hardware creates a baseline that renders Tidal's advantage totally useless. (That's good news if you mostly listen to streaming music on your phone, since Tidal's lossless service is $10 more per month.) And, of course, remember that St. Vincent likes crunchy horns.",0.6074158971478706,0.3925841028521294,0.17603600321716636,482,5.0,309,5.7831715210355989,1,0,"Apple, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The agency saw backlash after details of the operation were revealed, as those programs already faced opposition in key regions and began to see even less acceptance as well as deadly attacks on health workers following the revelation. The CIA's director apparently implemented the ban in August of last year, but it was only revealed in a letter last week in a letter sent to deans of 12 public health schools who had joined together to condemn the use of health programs for covert operations.  ""This CIA policy applies worldwide."" The letter attempts to fully distance the CIA from vaccination campaigns, explaining that it would not make use of the programs or their workers. ""Similarly, the agency will not seek to obtain or exploit DNA or other genetic material acquired through such programs,"" Lisa Monaco, President Obama's homeland security advisor, writes in the letter. ""This CIA policy applies worldwide and to US and non-US persons alike."" The reply comes as a late response to the deans' letter, which was reportedly sent in January of last year. But it may be no coincidence that it arrived now. Polio is seeing a comeback in select countries in the Middle East and Africa, and the World Health Organization recently declared it a global emergency. With distrust of Western vaccinators already contributing to the issue, the United States' government likely hopes to avoid having any further program and personnel endangerment or failures pinned on it. Laurie Garrett, Pulitzer Prize winner and senior fellow of global health for the nonprofit Council on Foreign Relations, was reportedly the first to reveal the letter's existence. She writes on Facebook that she's been distressed about the CIA's use of vaccine programs and is delighted that it's agreed to stop using them.

Researchers intravenously delivered 10,000 times the typical dosage of measles vaccine to two women, 49- and 65-years-old, who had multiple myeloma, a rare cancer affecting white blood cells in bone marrow. The virus, which was modified to specifically target cancer cells, reduced or eliminated tumors in the two patients. The 49-year-old woman responded particularly well; other than one local relapse that was treated with radiotherapy, her tumors have disappeared and cancer has remained in remission for over six months. The idea of using viruses to attack cancer isn't a new one — scientists have been studying the technique since the 1950s. However, researchers say that this is the first time they've been able eliminate cancer in a human subject using the virus through an intravenous injection. The virus was able to target the tumors itself and even treat affected bone marrow. Other similar studies have used direct injection into tumor sites rather than intravenous delivery methods. ""We believe it can become a single-shot cure."" That's part of what has the researchers particularly optimistic about the results. Dr. Stephen J. Russell, the study's lead author, said, ""What we're really excited about with this particular approach is that we believe it can become a single-shot cure."" Traditional cancer treatments require months of visits to continue battling the cancer cells. One hurdle for the technique, however, is that patients who've built up antibodies — close to 95 percent of the US public has been vaccinated to measles — are not eligible for the treatment. However, myeloma does weaken patients' immune systems, which makes the virus more effective. Despite promise in the treatment, it's important to note that this is still extremely early. Other promising virus-based cancer treatments have been tested many times in the past but none have advanced far through clinical trials. Incredibly thorough trials with far more patients will be required as these results are far from definitive. Dr. Stephen Russell warned: ""We have an enormous amount of work to do to determine if this is generalizable and how to best apply the approach to other cancer patients.""

The family notified nearby Museum of Paleontology Egidio Feruglio (MEF), and now researchers at the site have unearthed what they believe is the largest dinosaur ever. It's estimated that the massive beast weighed almost 80 tons (80,000 kg) and stood 65 feet tall (20 meters) when it walked the earth some 95 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period. Measurements suggest it was over 130 feet (40 meters) from its head to the tip of its tail. That means it was roughly as long as a 13-story building. But this truly gigantic dinosaur was a herbivore. The specimens found in Argentina's Chubut province (which is part of the Patagonia region) belong to the sauropod group of dinosaurs, which are noted by their small heads, thick, pillar-like legs, and long necks and tails. Perhaps the most well-known sauropod is the Apatosaurus, which often goes by the name ""Brontosaurus"" in pop culture. But this latest sauropod is twice as long and up to four times as heavy, and researchers are classifying it as a new species of Titanosaur, which is a group of extremely large sauropods.  One of the massive fossilized femurs used to estimate the size of the dinosaur.  (Museum of Paleontology Egidio Feruglio / José María Farfaglia.) Paleontologists led by Dr. José Luis Carballido and Dr. Diego Pol of MEF found seven adult specimens in the same spot, and the roughly 200 fossils discovered so far are in wonderful condition. Among the cache of fossils they've found significant pieces of the neck, back, and legs, as well as ""most of the vertebrae of the tail,"" according to a press release from MEF. ""It's a real paleontological treasure,"" says Dr. Carballido. He suggests that the adult individuals likely died in the same spot, perhaps huddling around a dwindling water source. By measuring the diameter of load-bearing bones like the femur and humerus, the team was able to estimate the size and weight of the dinosaurs. Their findings just beat out another very similar Titanosaur, Argentinosaurus (pictured above), which has long been considered the largest dinosaur ever. Argentinosaurus is estimated to have weighed roughly 73 tons. It, too, was discovered in the Patagonia region of Argentina, which is a hot spot for dinosaur fossils.  Seven of the massive dinosaurs were found in the same spot in Argentina's Patagonia region. (Museum of Paleontology / Egidio Feruglio) If initial estimates hold up, this latest find will not only take the title of largest dinosaur ever — it will be the biggest animal ever known to have walked the earth. But it doesn't have a name yet. Researchers tell BBC News that ""it will be named describing its magnificence and in honor to both the region and the farm owners who alerted us about the discovery."" Another discovery at a different site in Argentina this week proved that a much smaller member of the sarupod family, a group known as the diplodocids, lived not just in North America, but also in South America. Numerous media reports have conflated the two finds, but this second discovery is of a herbivore just 30 feet (9 meters) in length. Nevertheless, there may be much more to find at the site in Chubut province. Dr. Carballido says that they are ""still working on this extraordinary site."" He adds: ""We estimate that one-fifth of excavation process [is complete], so there is still much work to do and probably much to discover.""

As reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team led by Stanford electrical engineer Ada Poon constructed an electronic device smaller than a grain of rice that can be recharged wirelessly by a power source the size of a credit card. According to the paper published today, Poon's breakthrough discovery in wireless power requires roughly as much energy as a cell phone and exposes subjects to radiation levels well below the threshold for human safety. an electronic device smaller than a grain of rice The method pioneered by Poon is called mid-field wireless transfer. It works on the idea that electromagnetic waves travel differently depending on the kind of material they encounter. Poon used her discovery to engineer a power source that generates a special type of near-field wave like the kind used to power hearing implants. The wave changes characteristics when it moves from air to skin – similar to how sound waves travel faster and at greater distances though train tracks than through air, allowing the vibration of the wheels to be heard before the train itself. As a result, Poon's power source can circumvent the normal range limitations of near-field waves and penetrate deeper into the body.  Poon believes that her work could lead to programmable microimplants like sensors that monitor vital functions, electrostimulators that alter neural signals in the brain, and drug delivery systems that apply medicine directly where needed. All without the bulk of batteries and recharging systems required today. Her endeavours could also help expedite the development of medical treatments that utilize electronics instead of drugs. Stanford Neurosciences Institute director William Newsome said that ""the Poon lab has solved a significant piece of the puzzle for safely powering implantable microdevices."" So far, the wireless charging system has been tested in a pig and also used to power a pacemaker in a rabbit. The next step is human trials.

Given the UK's current rate of fossil fuel consumption and its current known reserves, the country is said to have 5.2 years of oil, 4.5 years of coal, and three years of gas left. In contrast, Germany — a country that's willing to bulldoze a village to get at its coal reserves — has 250 years of coal left.

The proposed method involves colliding two photons — the massless particles of light — that have extremely high energy to transform them into two particles with mass, and researchers in the past have been able to prove that it works. But in replicating that old method, known as Breit–Wheeler pair production, they had to introduce particles that did have mass into the process. Imperial College London researchers, however, say that it's now possible to create a collider that only includes photons.  Theoretical for now, but possible with existing technologyThe researchers' ""photon–photon collider,"" which they're describing in a paper that's being published today in Nature Photonics, works by firing high-energy photons into a field of photons emitted as blackbody radiation. When the photons collide, the researchers believe that a significant number of them will turn from light to matter — more specifically, into an electron and a positron. What happens in the collider is a matter of Einstein's famous formula at play. With enough energy — a whole, whole lot of it — massless particles can be transformed into matter. In order to get all of that energy, most methods have used electrons to provide a boost. A similar technique is used here, but the critical difference is that this collider keeps all of the electrons outside of the vacuum in which the collision occurs — so matter is actually created in an environment devoid of it. To do that, the researchers propose firing electrons into a gold slab, which would send high-energy photons shooting in the direction of the radiation chamber. Electrons would make it through the gold slab, but they'd all be filtered out from the photons using a magnetic field. The researchers don't say whether they plan on making and testing the new collider, but they say it should be fairly easy to create with existing technology.",0.5756979112349261,0.4243020887650739,0.6588972090259215,347,5.0489913544668585,198,5.9646464646464645,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And the 42-year-old adult film director and gay porn performer readily admits that the decision wasn't all that hard to make — especially when compared with the alternative. ""It just seemed healthier to run the risk of experiencing side effects than to worry about HIV,"" he says, adding ""I come from a generation where people were dying all the time, so I grew up living in fear."" Lucas is part of a small but growing subset of HIV-negative gay and bisexual men who have embraced Truvada, the most widely used incarnation of an HIV preventative drug regimen called PrEP. The little blue pill, which is taken daily and costs $13,000 a year (but is covered by most insurers), helps reduce infection rates by more than 90 percent. But until recently, only a select few were aware of the drug's existence as an HIV preventative. The US government's announcement last week that it was urging physicians to prescribe PrEP to anyone who might be at risk for HIV infection — not just men who have sex with men who might be HIV positive — therefore came as a surprise. ""Soon every gay man will be taking this drug."" ""If broadly followed,"" The New York Times wrote, ""the advice could transform AIDS prevention in the United States."" Slate took a less nuanced route, referring to the pill as a ""miracle drug."" But Lucas is even more adamant about the drug's HIV-eradicating potential. ""We are there now. This is the breaking point,"" he says. ""Soon every gay man will be taking this drug and we won't have HIV spreading any longer — it'll be over."" These statements are both beautiful and revitalizing — a tone that is, unfortunately, rare in the media's coverage of HIV prevention. But in their rush to embrace a preventative method that is indeed remarkably effective, many missed an opportunity to move the conversation surrounding Truvada forward. ""We know that the medicine works, it's proven,"" says Jay Laudato, executive director of the Callen-Lorde Community Health Center, which provides healthcare to New York City's LGBTQ communities. ""But what was shockingly missing from the government's announcement was ‘how do we integrate this drug into peoples' lives?' and into HIV prevention plans in general."" He thinks the drug is a good fit for some people, but Laudato says it's not right for everyone who might be part of an ""at-risk"" group. Where will homeless kids keep a bottle of pills? People who take injection drugs, for example, might not be able to take the drug every day. ""If you're in the throes of substance use, you might not be a reliable person to receive a medication that requires daily adherence."" And Laudato wonders where the homeless kids that frequent the center, many of whom partake in sex work, might keep a bottle of Truvada. ""If you're someone who has a job, and you understand the risk of side effects, then that's great,"" he says, but the question that health care providers have to ask themselves is ""how do we make the right use of this potent tool and administer it to the people who need it the most?"" — meaning to those who dwell the places where HIV is most persistent. Emma Claire, an HIV harm-reduction counselor and porn performer, voiced a similar opinion. ""I think PrEP is a great option, but I don't think it's the solution,"" she says. ""I don't think anything is a solution, short of a vaccine against HIV."" Claire thinks that education should remain a priority. People should be aware of all the ways they can protect themselves against HIV infection — including PrEP. ""People want options and that's fine,"" she says, ""but you aren't going to see a decrease in transmission rates until people have a lot more knowledge about STD transmission in general."" ""People who are taking truvada are the most responsible."" But Lucas, who also believes in HIV education, views things differently. ""I recommend that every [gay] man take it, no matter whether they think their relationship is monogamous or not,"" he says. ""I think people who are taking Truvada are the most responsible."" Predictably, a statement made by the US government in favor of a drug that has been shown to prevent HIV infection, even without the use of a condom, also elicited plenty of controversy. Notably, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation issued a statement in which CEO Michael Weinstein was quoted as saying that he feared the CDC would ""come to regret"" its decision because a ""government-sanctioned widespread deployment of PrEP will be accompanied with a shift to condom-less sex."" These comments were perhaps meant to underscore the need for people to continue using condoms to protect themselves against other STIs, such as syphilis and the increasingly antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea. But to some, they came off as condescending and faithless instead. women have fought against that same kind of moralizing ""I'm infuriated by intimations that prevention drugs lead to people engaging in riskier behavior,"" said Lorelei Lee, a porn performer, film director, and sex worker advocate, in an email to The Verge. Women, she wrote, have fought that same kind of moralizing in trying to get insurance coverage for birth control pills. It's demoralizing to see it happen all over again to people who are taking steps to protect themselves against a disease that is still widely considered deadly. Moreover, studies have shown that PrEP drugs do not increase risk-taking, Lee said, ""so to insist otherwise — especially if you are someone with a large media platform, like AHF's Michael Weinstein — is the height of irresponsibility."" The nature of Weinstein's comments echo a 2012 Huffington Post article in which writer David Duran coined the term ""Truvada whores."" Duran used the name when referencing the gay men that he feared might view the drug as a license to have unsafe, condom-less sex, but has since apologized and revised his position on the matter. Yet Lucas explains that men — especially those too young to remember the terrible toll that HIV took on the gay community — are already having sex without condoms, so Truvada might finally provide them with a preventative method that they are willing to use. ""The new generation didn't see people dying,"" says Lucas, who is currently in a relationship with Tyler Helms, an activist who has written about living with HIV. ""They didn't see the epidemic, so they aren't using condoms."" The shaming is real, and it's dangerous Despite the media's fixation on the term Truvada whore, Lucas says he hasn't heard anyone in the gay community use it. Yet the shaming sentiments that lurk behind the term are real, he says — and they're dangerous. ""Weinstein can say ‘use a condom' as much as he wants, but condoms fail and there are 50,000 new cases of HIV every year in the US,"" he says. ""So I think it's criminal when gay people like him tell others not to take a drug that could save so many lives."" Weinstein also attacked the drug's effectiveness, stating that PrEP has a ""limited preventive effect at best."" But a recent study found that men who take Truvada seven days a week are 99 percent protected against HIV (meaning that none of the study participants who took the drug every day developed the virus). The drug is also widely considered a low-side-effect medication. ""About 1 in 10 people will have some discomfort like nausea and cramping for about four weeks,"" says Robert Grant, an AIDS researcher at the Gladstone Institutes and a spokesperson for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. The drug is also accompanied by a 1 in 200 chance of altered kidney function, so patients need to get routine blood tests, Grant says. ""But the vast majority of people don't experience side-effects at all."" Considering the mounting evidence surrounding PrEP's effectiveness, and evidence that condom use among teens and young adults is declining, it's hard to argue with that PrEP represents a remarkable asset in the fight against HIV. But the path forward, one that's been uphill since the beginning, isn't exactly clear. HIV is still laden with stigma, Laudato says. And considering the controversy already building around PrEP, it might be time for people to consider what the government's announcement could one day represent — and how to make the most of it. ""It's absolutely worth the money for people not to get infected with HIV,"" Laudato says, but ""we still need to figure out how to get the most out of this tool.""",0.6433252191873399,0.35667478081266013,0.8328427231210052,1445,4.9065743944636679,670,6.3462686567164175,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In 2013, Verizon strengthened its position as the top carrier in the US, expanded its LTE network to cover over 99 percent of its 3G footprint, and negotiated a massive buyback of Vodafone's 45 percent stake in the company. In the year-ago quarter, Verizon Communications reported a significant loss attributed to the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy and rising costs in employee pensions, but this time around the company earned $7.9 billion on $31 billion in revenue. The wireless division of the company accounted for $21.1 billion in revenue. It also added another 1.7 million new customers to its total subscriber count, which is now 102.8 million. Verizon reports that it activated 8.8 million smartphones in the fourth quarter and smartphones accounted for 88.9 percent of activations, an increase of 3.5 percent over the third quarter. Verizon says that its LTE network now covers almost 305 million people, or 97 percent of the US population, and is available in over 500 markets. Sixty-nine percent of the carrier's data traffic now flows over its LTE network, and Verizon said it activated 9 million new LTE devices, including smartphones, tablets, and data devices, in the quarter. The wireless industry in the US went through a number of changes in 2013, mostly spurred on by the activities of T-Mobile. While Verizon did make some changes to its plan offerings, including launching new lower cost service plans and a rapid upgrade plan, its subscriber growth shows that it hasn't taken the same kind of hit that Sprint and AT&T have seen due to T-Mobile's aggressive plans. Verizon is also the only one of the top four carriers to not offer a discount to customers that are no longer on contract. The company will be holding a call later this morning to discuss the earnings report in detail, and we will report on any news that comes from it.

Richard Sherman's not the household name Peyton Manning is, but he's taken an early lead in the race to be the most-discussed topic ahead of Super Bowl XLVII. Sherman is the stud cornerback who clinched Sunday's NFC Conference Championship with a gorgeous, leaping deflection, and then thoroughly upstaged himself minutes later with a loud, fiesty, staring-daggers-into-the-camera bout of trash-talking against the San Francisco 49ers, receiver Michael Crabtree, and everyone who might still question how good Sherman really is. ""Don't you open your mouth about the best, or I'ma shut it for you real quick!"" And back to you, Joe Buck. Sherman's post-play celebration got him penalized and got him slapped in the face. His post-game outburst made him the subject of an online uproar that called into question everything from trash-talking to race to whether or not Richard Sherman is actually good at football. But the whole thing almost felt pre-ordained, seen months ago by Sherman himself. His latest Sports Illustrated column on Monday addressed ""those who call me a thug or worse,"" but it didn't need to — he has a rich endorsement deal to do that for him.  On Sunday, timed obviously around the high-stakes game, Beats released the latest in its series of ""Hear What You Want"" commercials. It's Sherman, at his locker in a T-shirt, headphones perched on his temples, patiently answering questions. His trash talk isn't distracting, he says, it's motivating. Not every kid from Compton is a gang member, he reminds reporters, barely suppressing an eye roll. One reporter leans over to another, in the back of the scrum, and says, ""he thinks he's so fucking untouchable."" Sherman puts up with everything until someone asks if he's a thug. Then he, ace student and Stanford graduate, Sports Illustrated columnist, incorrigible trash-talker and controversy-stirrer, puts on his headphones and walks away as Aloe Blacc's ""The Man"" drowns out everything else.  Sherman is the man, statistically the NFL's best cornerback, and he wants everyone to know it. He especially wants Michael Crabtree to know it. This is the Beats message, the one it's promoted with everyone from Sherman to Kevin Garnett to Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who threw the ball at Sherman on the last play of the game: just be yourself and play your game. (And listen to a lot of self-promoting, chest-thumping music.) No one does that better than Richard Sherman. A lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of a sheep.  Even Sherman's celebration, including a choking gesture to Colin Kaepernick, was itself a not-exactly-subtle call to another Beats commercial — of, appropriately, a Seattle crowd hurling food and insults in Kaepernick's general direction. (Though this week the crowd threw food at the injured Navarro Bowman, not Kaepernick.) Beats gets football, and Richard Sherman gets marketing.  Immediately after the game, ""What do you expect? Sherman is a thug"" lit up Twitter. Get out those headphones, Richard. Are people surprised about Sherman? He's a thug, it happens  Sherman is a thug. I can't wait to see him get blown up by Peyton and the Broncos receivers.  Sherman is a thug. Worst sportsmanship I've ever seen.  The other ""Hear What You Want"" commercials are standard overcoming-adversity fare — nobody believes in you, you're too old, and the like. Ads like Kapernick's are fine but forgettable, but Sherman's was something different. He knows exactly how people think and talk about him, and he's smart and brash enough to respond. Beats wound up a rare mix of lucky and good, its headphones on the ears of the epicenter of conversation ahead of the year's most-watched event. It's almost surprising Sherman didn't finish his tirade, throw on a pair of Beats, and strut off the field in blissful silence, as the stadium's PA system blared ""I'm the man I'm the man I'm the man.""

Netflix and other streaming video services are on the rise, and it's seemingly happening at the expense of premium TV channels. The new data comes from The NPD Group, which found that streaming video services saw a four percent uptick in subscribed households over the past two years, while premium TV channels — such as HBO and Showtime — saw a collective decline of six percent. The two are beginning to close in on each other as well: 32 percent of US households are now subscribed to a premium channel, while 27 percent are subscribed to a streaming video service.

While The NPD Group didn't confirm that consumers are specifically choosing to drop premium channels in favor of streaming services, its analysts suspect as much. “As [subscription video on demand] services have gained momentum, it’s clear that some consumers are trimming their premium TV subscriptions,"" Russ Crupnick, SVP of industry analysis for The NPD Group, says in a statement. Crupnick also points toward streaming services' attempts to become channels on their own through original shows as an element driving the change. Though Hulu and Amazon haven't been particularly successful in their original programming endeavors, Netflix indisputably has, and these numbers suggest its bet on exclusive content is paying off.

A new on-demand music service arrives with a gorgeous app, a focus on editorial curation, and a lot to prove: the description fits Beats Music, which launches its service for $9.99 per month on Tuesday. (AT&T customers will be able to sign up for a $14.99 per month family plan, which allows up to five users full access to the service.) But it also applied to MOG, the service that became Beats after it sold to the maker of popular headphones. Four years after MOG tried and failed to knock off Spotify, Beats executives are confident they have the product — and the marketing dollars — to make streaming music go mainstream. But has anything really changed? Interviews with former MOG executives suggest that for Beats to win, the company would do well to spend at least as much time marketing its service as it did building it. Spotify, with its utilitarian black-and-pea-green design, has long trailed competitors in looks and features. But by securing better deals with labels than its peers, and showing a genius for getting its app distributed, the company has galloped past its competitors to more than 24 million monthly users — momentum so strong that other companies are too embarrassed to reveal their own numbers. While the company has yet to turn a profit, Spotify raised $250 million in November in an effort to outmuscle all its rivals. Soon afterward, it unveiled free artist-specific radio stations for mobile devices that none of its peers can match. It was exactly the kind of move that has made it so hard to compete with over the years — using its momentum to build free services that draw in new users by the millions. ""Spotify had the marketing dollars that none of the other services had,"" one former MOG executive says, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity to preserve business relationships. ""Ultimately, that’s what really put them head of the pack.""  Ben Popper interviews Beats CEO Ian Rogers MOG, which began life as a network of music blogs, launched its subscription service on the web in December 2009. That was more than a year before Spotify, beset by negotiating troubles with the major record labels, launched in the United States. MOG earned some critical raves and was first to introduce a handful of features later adopted by its competitors, including personalized radio and high-bitrate streaming for audiophiles. ""They were kind of the little engine that could, a little 40-50 person company building a great product with high fidelity,"" says Ian Rogers, the CEO of Beats Music, who was a paying MOG subscriber. ""The marketing team was a couple of people, and there was no money there at all."" But even though MOG had a head start on Spotify in the United States, the Swedish company founded by Daniel Ek quickly came to dominate the conversation around digital music. Its competitors were caught flat-footed when Spotify offered a free, advertising-supported version — something US record labels never would have allowed them to do, and which attracted several million people to try streaming audio for the first time. MOG’s marketing efforts paled by comparison. ""The marketing team was a couple of people, and there was no money there at all,"" Rogers says. ""They were reliant entirely on word of mouth."" The free tier proved to be the first of several marketing coups for Spotify. Another came in 2011, at Facebook's F8 developer conference, when the social network unveiled Open Graph, its system for letting third-party developers publish stories to the News Feed. Spotify, Rdio, and MOG were all launch partners with Facebook — but only Spotify got to put its chief executive on stage with Mark Zuckerberg, in a move that surprised MOG executives.  Less than a week later, Spotify announced that it had added 1 million new users. MOG finally introduced its own free tier that month, but it may have been too late. The company never reported how many subscribers it had, and it struggled to gain attention. And so few were surprised in the spring of 2012 when word got out that MOG was up for sale. In July, Beats announced it would acquire the service for $14 million — at a time when Spotify was fast climbing to a valuation of $4 billion.  So how does Beats plan to beat the competition? Spotify isn't the only competitor it has to worry about — there are also Pandora, iTunes Radio, Google Play Music, and Rdio, with Deezer set to arrive in the United States later this year. Notably, Beats will launch without a free tier beyond a seven-day trial. ""If free is your only innovation, I think that’s pretty sad — that’s my review on that,"" Rogers says. ""I think that people are willing to pay for a good experience."" ""If free is your only innovation, I think that’s pretty sad."" The good news, if you're a Beats investor, is that the company seems to have learned from MOG's marketing mistakes. It raised $60 million to build and promote Beats Music. It signed promotional deals with AT&T, Target, and Ellen DeGeneres that are likely to introduce streaming music to a wide swath of music fans who are still paying $0.99 for digital downloads. And with music icons Jimmy Iovine, Dr. Dre, and Trent Reznor heavily involved in building the service, Beats can also leverage its relationships with top-tier artists into a powerful promotional machine. The launch promotions will culminate with an ad that airs during the Super Bowl. ""Beats is a very established brand,"" Rogers says. ""Almost half of the people we survey say they would install it just based on the brand. But we’ve also got these partnerships. And this game is going to be won with distribution."" Critics have generally scoffed at the sound quality of Beats Electronics' headphones, but there's no denying their wide reach. The company, which was founded by music mogul Iovine and Dr. Dre, began selling its headphones in 2008 for $350. Five years later Beats owned 59 percent of the market for headphones that cost $99 or more, according to NPD Group. The Wall Street Journal reported last year that Beats revenues increased fivefold between 2010 and 2012, to roughly $1 billion. It got there in part through the bold design of its headphones and the imprimatur of Dre. But it has also been shrewd at promotion — securing a product placement deal with American Idol, for example, that put its headphones in front of millions of Americans every week. (Iovine served as a mentor on the show from 2011 to 2013.) Slick design and cool features alone are no guarantee of success In the run-up to Beats’ launch on Tuesday, its executives are spending most of their time talking about the app's extensive editorial curation, which features hand-built playlists for scores of artists documenting their influences and artists they have influenced. They're talking about Right Now, which lets you generate a playlist by creating a ""musical status update"" based on your location, current activity, who you're with, and what genre you'd like to hear. But if MOG's experience proved anything — and as Rdio's struggles have highlighted as well — slick design and cool features alone are no guarantee of success. With most Americans still unsold on the idea of renting their music rather than purchasing it outright or downloading it illegally, streaming-music companies face an uphill battle. The most effective way to persuade them to date has been to give them music for free for as long as possible. Beats isn't taking that approach. And if it's marketing efforts don’t prove as effective as executives promise, its history may wind up looking a lot like MOG's.",0.6421239618065931,0.35787603819340685,0.8246430225336757,1299,4.8922247882986909,634,6.0441640378548893,1,0,"Business, Culture, Entertainment, Interview, Report, Videos",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The study, which was based on 3,500 listings in New York City, concludes that black hosts are earning 12 percent less than white hosts for similar properties. The authors say that suggests that white hosts are able to charge more simply because they're white. Airbnb puts an emphasis on the people behind the properties in order to build trust, including large profile pictures, biographical information, and connections from Facebook and Twitter. A thumbnail of the host’s photo shows up next to the main photo of the property in the search results page. The study’s authors believe that emphasis exacerbates the problem of racial discrimination in online marketplaces. Discriminatory effects have been found in online marketplaces including Craigslist, where names commonly used by black people resulted in lower response rates, and the dating site OKCupid, where the site’s statistician writes that ""although race shouldn’t matter in messaging, it does. A lot."" ""Although race shouldn’t matter in messaging, it does. A lot."" Michael Luca and Benjamin Edelman decided to look at race dynamics on Airbnb out of a broader interest in discovering the best way to design online marketplaces. eBay and Amazon do not focus on the pictures of the sellers, for example, while staffing sites like TaskRabbit do. ""We became interested in this issue when we noticed that online marketplaces are becoming more and more social, with extensive seller and buyer profiles and pictures alongside more standard information about products and services,"" Michael Luca, one of the study’s authors, tells The Verge in an email. ""We understand the benefits of this, but are uncomfortable with the notion that more pictures/profiles/information are unambiguously better."" Airbnb declined to provide the professors with data for the study, which had to rely on data harvested from public listings. The company also denies that it has a discrimination problem, saying the study is flawed. Airbnb says the study is flawed ""We are committed to making Airbnb the most open, trusted, diverse, transparent community in the world and our Terms of Service prohibit content that discriminates,"" the company says in a statement. ""The data in this report is nearly two years old and is from only one of the more than 35,000 cities where Airbnb hosts welcome guests into their homes. Additionally, the authors made a number of subjective or inaccurate determinations when compiling their findings."" Airbnb says the study, which is still under review for publication, did not control for factors such as how often a property is booked and the number of reviews a host has. The company declined to offer its own data that would counter the study’s conclusions, however. The idea that profile pictures lead to discrimination shouldn’t surprise anybody. It’s a tricky problem, but not a new one. Discrimination based on race, gender, and other factors is alive in the real world; when orchestras began holding ""blind"" auditions in which a candidate played from behind a curtain, the number of women hired went from 5 percent to 25 percent. The rise of the ""sharing economy"" in which people buy and sell their extra time, skills, and property directly to one another depends on the ability of the internet to facilitate trust. Everything from ride-sharing services to sites like Kickstarter try to highlight the people on the other side of the app, and that’s actually one of the reasons some users prefer to dip into the sharing economy rather than give their dollars to some corporate conglomerate: it feels more personal. It’s hailed as a progressive revolution in the country’s economy. It’s a tricky problem, but not a new one Airbnb has no legal obligation to change its interface in order to de-emphasize profiles and personal photos, even if the site’s design is inadvertently encouraging discrimination. But while profile pictures may lead some users to feel better about trusting strangers on the internet, it’s not in Airbnb or anyone’s interest to inadvertently penalize a group of its users. That’s the opposite of progress. New York City has strict fair housing laws — although bias there usually goes the opposite way, with landlords excluding non-white tenants — and there is a streamlined legal process for those who feel they’ve been discriminated against. Airbnb and similar marketplaces are so new that in the process of disrupting the traditional economy they sometimes can also lose established consumer protections. ""Our point is that when deciding what information to prominently display, online market designers should think both about how to build trust and facilitate transactions but also how to minimize unintended consequences,"" Dr. Luca says.",0.612681607553586,0.387318392446414,0.8665373939939286,786,5.3015267175572518,422,6.5023696682464456,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Despite stiff objections from the NFL, the Commission has put an end to the rules that barred cable and satellite providers from airing games blacked out on local broadcast stations because they failed to sell out. But it only ends the government's rules. The NFL still has its own, private blackout rules in place with broadcasters like FOX and CBS, and those may still prevent fans from watching local games when tickets remain at the box office. Specifically, here's what the FCC says is the outcome of today's vote: The action removes Commission protection of the NFL’s current private blackout policy, which requires local broadcast stations to black out a game if a team does not sell a certain percentage of tickets to the game at least 72 hours prior to the game. Until now, the FCC's rules protected the NFL's restrictions by extending them to cable and satellite, but they're now history. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler led a public campaign to dismantle the rules, going so far as publishing a USA Today editorial that accused blackout rules of ""hurting loyal fans."" ""We at the FCC shouldn't be complicit in preventing sports fans from watching their favorite teams on TV,"" Wheeler wrote earlier this month. On the opposite side, the NFL has argued blackout rules help the league keep ""games on free television without an issue."" The NFL has tried to appeal to fans with its own public-facing website arguing that the old rules have worked just fine for decades. As other sports have made their way primarily to cable, the NFL insists its blackout rules help keep games on over-the-air channels for fans. The league has also claimed that the rules help local economies and businesses near football stadiums. But Wheeler never bought into any of those argument. ""If the league truly has the best interest of millions of American fans at heart, they could simply commit to staying on network television in perpetuity,"" he said. So the NFL's broadcast TV blackouts remain in place, but today's unanimous vote could help pressure the league and team owners into permanently doing away with them.

The Uighurs, a Muslim minority in the western province of Xinjiang, have long sought greater autonomy from China, which has in turn stepped up its efforts to combat militants with raids and judicial crackdowns. Last week, the country jailed a Uighur advocate to life in prison for ""inciting separatism."" Violence has escalated in recent months, as well. Last year, an SUV drove into a crowd and burst into flames, killing five people; in March, 29 people were killed by a group of attackers in a Beijing train station.

Website monitoring services blockedinchina.net and greatfire.org both indicate that mainland China cannot access Instagram.  Notably, a block from Beijing does not mean that Hong Kong has been cut off from the service. Bystanders are continuing to post photos from the protests onto Instagram from the city. The apparent Instagram block comes as Hong Kong police forces have intensified their efforts to break up the protests. The New York Times reports that riot police have been deployed and are using tear gas against protestors. The protests, currently in their third day, are largely led by younger residents who oppose a new proposal that would allow officials in Beijing to approve candidates before election day, a system some say would make a mockery of elections.",0.5364638068659537,0.46353619313404626,0.9065760789034579,215,5.195348837209302,142,5.971830985915493,0,0,"Apps, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Among civil society groups, it's a common question, and one with far-reaching implications. Would technology make the people's movement stronger or easier to control? Does interconnection strengthen a crowd or distract it? Protestors are showing the limits of Chinese web controls This weekend in Hong Kong, we're finding out. Since Friday, the protests have pitted pro-democracy protestors against a central government that may be backing out of its promise for open elections. It's a test of how much power Hong Kong can have in the face of central China, with many in Hong Kong hoping to elect leaders with fewer ties to Beijing. But as the struggle has played out in the streets, it's also played out on the web as protestors begin to spread news through Twitter and organize online, showing the limits of China's heavy-handed web controls. Like most modern movements, the Hong Kong protests have a strong presence online. Occupy Central, one of the biggest groups in the movement, has spread its message through a Wordpress blog where the group lists its manifesto, basic tenets and a manual for civil disobedience. Search for #occupycentral or ""umbrella revolution"" on Twitter and Instagram and you'll see a flood of photos from the protests, alongside Facebook-ready memes and plans for upcoming actions. It's easy to follow each event from your phone, amplifying the effect of each action and giving protestors a crucial voice as they press for concessions from the local government. When protestors organized to carry a black banner through the city streets, they could be sure it would attract attention internationally, whether local media covered the action or not. 維穩叔叔，我們只有一把傘 pic.twitter.com/aeKe2Ed6H2  The protest has gone far beyond what would be allowed on the web in mainland China, where the Great Firewall monitors and filters out any media deemed unacceptable by the government. One picture retweeted by the official Occupy Central account shows a man with an umbrella facing down a tank, a direct reference to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and one of the biggest red flags for Chinese web censors. But since Hong Kong and Twitter sit outside the Great Firewall, the censors had no way to stop it. Sina Weibo has seen a record number of posts deleted Instead, mainland China has tightened the restrictions on the mainland web. On Sunday, the country blocked Instagram in an effort to slow the spread of protest photos, and Vine has seen intermittent problems as well. (The app appears to be back online, although its official status is still unclear.) Twitter has been blocked in mainland China since 2009, but the state-owned alternative, Sina Weibo, has seen a record number of posts deleted since the actions began, particularly any post using the phrase ""umbrella revolution."" Protestors have already started bracing for similar restrictions in Hong Kong. The peer-to-peer texting app Firechat has an enormous spike in usage, with 100,000 new users since the protests began and as many as 33,000 simultaneous users in various chat rooms. Because Firechat can communicate from phone-to-phone rather than relying on a central data network, Firechat chat rooms could potentially survive even in a web blackout, like the ones that struck protests in Egypt, Turkey, and Ukraine. Tor metrics show an extra 500 people browsing the web anonymously as the protests began on Saturday, suggesting users in Hong Kong are also starting to think about evading web surveillance. At the same time, the new tools have come with new dangers. In one troubling report, the Code For Hong Kong group discovered a fake chat app designed to spread malware between protestors, using the same open network as a platform for attack. Still, the rush of the last three days has shown how quickly a movement can grow when these tools are used effectively. In just 72 hours, the protestors have managed to define their goals and gain global prominence in the face of near-total opposition from established local media. The group has established symbols like the open umbrella that will have universal recognition for years to come. It's hard to imagine the message spreading so fast or so clearly without tools like Twitter, Instagram, and Wordpress. And while it's still too early to predict the ultimate effect of the protests, it's already one of the most substantial actions the region has seen in decades. As the last Chinese city outside the Great Firewall, Hong Kong is making the most of it.",0.7321474235024499,0.2678525764975501,0.5492821897351797,750,5.1293333333333333,401,6.3316708229426437,0,0,"US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Researchers from Lacoon Mobile Security say the phishing scam is spreading across the messaging application WhatsApp, through texts that read: ""Check out this Android app designed by Code4HK for the coordination of OCCUPY CENTRAL!"", along with a link to download software. Lacoon says the software, once downloaded, can access a user's personal data, including phone calls, text messages, and the physical location of their smartphone. Code4HK — a developer community that has helped to spread information about the protests — tells the Times it had nothing to do with the texts. The origin of the scam remains unknown, but Lacoon CEO Michael Shaulov says the Chinese government is likely behind it, given the location of the servers and the sophistication of the operation. The company traced it to a computer that they say is similar to those that the Chinese government allegedly used to launch cyberattacks against US targets last year. The spread of the app remains equally unclear, though Shaulov says it was downloaded by one out of every ten phones that received the fake message. It has affected both Android and iOS users alike, although many in the security world have noted that only jailbroken iOS phones are vulnerable. ""This is the first time that we have seen such operationally sophisticated iOS malware"" ""This is the first time that we have seen such operationally sophisticated iOS malware operational, which is actually developed by a Chinese-speaking entity,"" Shaulov told the Times. Similar iOS malware has been distributed by FinFisher, but never before linked to China. Today's report comes as thousands of protesters flocked to the streets on China's National Day, calling for Beijing to allow for free democratic elections in 2017. China had previously said it would allow Hong Kong to choose its own leader by that date, but backtracked on that promise in August, when it announced that all candidates would have to be approved by Beijing. Protesters in the ""Occupy Central"" movement have clashed with police since protests escalated over the weekend, and there are fears of further confrontation tonight, during National Day celebrations. The Chinese government has gone to great lengths to censor news of the demonstrations. Most state-run media have not mentioned it, and Chinese web censors have stepped up efforts to block images and videos on social media. On Sunday, the government blocked access to Instagram within mainland China, and posts on the Twitter-like service Sina Weibo have been aggressively deleted, according to the Times. In the past few days, censors have blocked any Weibo posts including the words ""Hong Kong,"" ""barricades,"" and ""umbrella"" — the unofficial symbol of Hong Kong's movement. 10/1 9:04am ET: Updated to clarify that only jailbroken iOS devices are vulnerable, and mention previous precedents",0.4339325925553692,0.5660674074446308,0.8468866049020161,488,5.278688524590164,290,6.3068965517241375,0,0,"Mobile, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

At first glance this game barely stands out from the flood of indie titles over the past few years, with its standard-issue pixel art and conspicuous combination of neon palette, aggressive electro, and low-res ultraviolence all straight out of Hotline Miami. But pick up the controller and you’ll find Not a Hero has more than enough of its own to say. It’s a raucous shower of joyful gore and pitch-perfect combat design. Despite its simple 2D exterior, Not a Hero is an action game centered around shooting from cover, like Gears of War, Uncharted, and dozens of other elaborate 3D games from the last console generation. What this means is that instead of blindly rushing into combat, you push a button to hide behind parts of scenery and only shoot when the time is right. Taking cover makes you impervious to bullet fire, even if you’re being shot at from behind, which doesn’t make a lot of sense but did make the game quite a bit easier once I figured it out. So, how does all this work in 2D? Really well, as it turns out. The controls are tight as a drum and all pinned together by a single inspired move: the slide. It’s the same button used as the one to take cover, but when you slide into an enemy, it knocks them over and lets you take them out in a single shot. It reminded me most of underrated Platinum Games shooter Vanquish; both games have a similar flow where you’re hopping between barriers, taking out bad guys along the way. Not a Hero is at its best when your thumbs dance across the buttons and you get out of a tight spot without a second thought. It’s no surprise that Not a Hero’s controls are so on point; the game comes from Roll7, the developer behind last year’s excellent skateboarding platformer OlliOlli and its recent sequel. The series showed the studio had a knack for nailing unconventional yet immediate 2D game design, and it’s a trait that’s carried onto its latest title. Aside from the controls, Not a Hero shares OlliOlli’s goal-based structure and one-more-try quick restarts, which is a good thing, because you will die a lot. If you’re in the UK and still reeling from last week’s general election, Not a Hero is here to remind you that things could be more controversial. The plot revolves around a murderous rabbit named Bunnylord who will stop at nothing to get elected and rule the country. Bunnylord tasks a wide variety of playable characters with things as benign as putting up posters and as bloody as assassinating gang leaders. The game takes place over three weeks of Bunnylord’s election campaign, with one mission for each day; how well you perform in each contributes to Bunnylord’s approval rating, which unlocks new characters as it rises. This structure works well, because until the last third of the game, it’s normally not too hard to finish a level — it’s completing the optional goals that provide the challenge. And you’ll want to unlock as many characters as you can, since they all play so differently; there’s the slow redneck with a shotgun, the generic East London thug, and the speedy ponytailed guy somewhat reminiscent of Jesus from The Big Lebowski. I can’t say I warmed to any of these characters, or Not a Hero’s tone in general. Too often it relies on obvious jokes, clichéd stereotypes, or self-conscious wackiness, which is a shame because Roll7 clearly put thought into the game’s presentation. The pixelated graphics have an attractive isometric depth, and I did appreciate occasional bright moments of British irreverence — think bored-sounding SWAT team taunts of ""you're going to prison!"" before they viciously kill you — but the overall style just wasn't my thing. As far as the underlying game goes, though, Not a Hero is pretty accessible. The obvious comparison is the unforgiving Hotline Miami, but the regenerating health bar and cover system help make Not a Hero a lot easier to get into at first. That’s not to say it isn’t punishing — when you do inevitably die, you have to start each stage over from the beginning. I should also call out the level design, which sometimes requires ""leaps of faith"" onto platforms you can’t yet see, and made me feel like I was playing a particularly cruel Sega Genesis game. But these are minor complaints. If you like your brutal bunny action rendered in cute graphics and played with near-perfect controls, Not a Hero is more than worth a shot.

The developer announced a partnership with mobile company DeNA back in March, and more recently said that we'd see five games released by the end of 2017 as part of the deal, including one in 2015. ""We aim to make each title a hit,"" Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said. The thing is, we have no idea what those games might look like. Nintendo still makes some amazing experiences, but some of its early forays into free-to-play, mobile-style games haven't been so great. DeNA, meanwhile, is best known for the terrible digital card game Rage of Bahamut. So what will happen when these two companies collide? The answer might look something like Puzzles & Dragons: Super Mario Bros. Edition, which launches on the Nintendo 3DS next week. ""We aim to make each title a hit."" Puzzles & Dragons has been a huge hit on mobile. As of January the game had been downloaded more than 40 million times across iOS and Android, with 6 million of those coming from players in North America. It's sort of like Candy Crush mashed up with Pokemon: you match like-colored gems in groups of three or more, and doing so will cast spells on monsters you're fighting. You can collect monsters, fuse them together, and evolve them into even more powerful creatures. It has that addictive gotta catch 'em all mentality that has made Pokemon such an enduring hit, and it's a perfect game to pick up and play for a few minutes at a time. The new Super Mario-themed version does away with the monsters and replaces them with characters from the Mushroom Kingdom. You can build a team of Marios and Luigis, and fight against goombas, blooper squids, and the koopa kids. You can still evolve characters; give a goomba the right power-up, and it'll sprout wings. Aside from a few gameplay tweaks, it's the same game as on mobile, just with a new coat of paint. For Mario fans, there's the familiar characters, music, and power-ups, and you even move around a board that looks ripped right out of Super Mario 3D Land. (The other difference, of course, is that this is a game that you buy for $30 bundled with Puzzles & Dragons Z, so it doesn't have all of the free-to-play trappings of the mobile version.)  It actually works quite well, and the developers have done a good job of cleverly integrating Mario elements into the experience. When you battle a squid, it'll shoot ink that blacks out some of your screen, and you can collect a number of variations of Mario and other characters. No collection is complete without raccoon Mario. These features don't fundamentally change the game, but they'll likely make it appealing to an audience who doesn't care about collecting and evolving dragons and trolls. And that's exactly the point: Nintendo's new mobile initiative is designed to introduce new players to the company's characters and games, and then hopefully lure them to console and handheld experiences. ""We will deploy our game business on smart devices not because we think that the dedicated game system business will wane, but because doing so will encourage a greater number of people to associate with Nintendo IP, to become familiar with the charms of video games, and, eventually, to explore more premium experiences on our dedicated game systems,"" Iwata explained during a recent financial results briefing. The new Puzzles & Dragons for 3DS is just one potential way the company could do that; take an existing, popular mobile-style game and give it a Nintendo twist.

Travel directions have been updated to show you multiple routes based on current travel time estimates and local traffic, rather than the single option the older version would give you. And the map view itself has been redesigned — rather than the lefthand info column always obscuring a large chunk of your view, Bing Maps now takes up the full browser window by default, with location details popping up on the left when needed. Right-clicking a location now brings up the option to save and sync a location across your Microsoft account and to the Windows Maps app, and you can jump right into the streetside view there, as well.

Microsoft is also interested in how HoloLens can be used artistically, writing that it's also interested in seeing it used for narrative storytelling or interactive journalism. Researchers won't be limited to those subjects, so long as their proposal helps to bring an understanding to ""the role and possible applications for holographic computing in society."" Microsoft will be accepting submissions through the beginning of September, with university and non-profit researchers eligible for the grants. It seems like a good way to get some interesting projects moving on HoloLens and ultimately giving the public — and Microsoft itself — a better idea of what augmented reality can be used for.

Geologists monitoring the mountains of the California Coast and Sierra Nevada ranges found that the vertical positions of more than 500 GPS sensors have been steadily increasing by between one and three millimeters every year. The authors of the study blame the rise on the huge amount of water extracted from the area by human hands. More than 160 cubic kilometers of water has been taken from the region for irrigation and other purposes in the last 150 years, a process that has contributed to a net raise in the height of the mountains, and may lead to more frequent earthquakes in the state. Mountains naturally rise and fall in height with the seasons, as snow and rain compress them in winter, before drier spells allow them to rise again by melting snow and evaporating water. But the geologists behind the Californian study say that the removal of groundwater for human use has reduced the weight on the Earth's crust, and caused the mountains to flex upward at an inflated rate. Colin Amos, lead author of the study, said he and his team had considered other tectonic causes for the year-on-year rise in height, but came to the conclusion that people were involved after modelling the crust in the area. ""It looks like the net vertical motion of the mountains upward can be explained just by humans sucking the water out of the ground."" The rise of the mountains may lead to an increase in seismic activity The study also says the rise of the ranges may cause more earthquakes in the area. Central Californian seismic activity is more common during dry seasons, as mountains flex upward and impact the nearby San Andreas fault, a process described as ""unclamping."" But commenting on the study in Nature, NASA's Paul Lundgren says that while quakes could be more frequent, they could also be smaller. Lundgren questions the link between the rise in mountain height and San Andreas seismic activity, suggesting that it's unclear whether unclamping will have a long-term impact on the fault, and clarifying that the study ""does not imply that a large earthquake is imminent."" But Lundgren points to its findings to show the activities of humans can make unexpected changes to our planet. ""Whether it's water withdrawal or things like oil extraction,"" he says, our actions ""can potentially have some other unintentional effects.""",0.46973388098744984,0.5302661190125502,0.8663472449025912,414,4.9637681159420293,229,6.0174672489082965,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At least that's what they'll have to do if they want to get funding from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the largest source of medical-research funding in the world. This change, NIH researchers announced in Nature today, will help close the sex gap that continues to exist in preclinical research — the research stage in which drugs and medical interventions are tested on animals and biological tissues — and will ""ensure that the health of the United States is being served by supporting science that meets the highest standards of rigor."" Using male animals is the norm Over the last two decades, researchers have identified a plethora of differences in the way women and men react to various drugs and develop diseases. Women, for instance, are more susceptible to multiple sclerosis than men, even though their symptoms are less serious. And some drugs, such as the sleeping aid Ambien, need to be prescribed in different doses depending on a patient's sex. But preclinical research continues to include a majority of male animals and tissues. In fact, many trials don't include female animals at all. This, some researchers say, might explain the higher rate of adverse drug reactions seen in women today. Janine Clayton, co-author of the Nature article and associate director for NIH research on women's health, said in an email to The Verge that ""using male animals and cells is by and large the status quo right now,"" even though a number of studies have shown that ""sex is a fundamental variable that should be considered from the very start."" Clayton points to studies showing that women and men respond differently to techniques for smoking cessation, such as nicotine patches. Clayton also points to the fact that men and women show different blood vessel patterns, which explains why women can exhibit very different symptoms than men during a heart attack. ""Learning this, and understanding what this means, has allowed us to act fast for women, saving lives,"" she said. This statement comes off as encouraging, but it also hints to a much starker flip-side, one where scientists might have discovered these differences earlier had they included more female tissues at the preclinical stage. Blame it on their hormones Jeffrey Mogil, a pain researcher at McGill University in Montreal who regularly works with animal subjects, says that researchers avoid using female animals because many believe that female test subjects introduce more variability in their data. Clayton echoed Mogil, stating that some scientists ""assume that using female animals is problematic due to the fact that female animals cycle hormonally."" Numerous studies have disproved these beliefs — including a study published by Mogil's team in 2005 — but the male-centered practice persists. ""I guess if you go back far enough it was sexism,"" Mogil says, but scientists today mostly just ""do experiments the way they were taught to do experiments."" This, the researcher explains, includes using mostly male animals — even though the convention is ""probably unethical, when you come right down to it."" It's ""probably unethical."" The changes mandated by the NIH will be rolled out progressively, because the agency wants to ensure that scientists can properly adjust their experimental designs. ""To help scientists understand and adapt to the changing policies, we will create training modules on experimental design,"" Clayton said. ""Of course, we will also monitor compliance with new policies and perform data analysis to track our progress."" Researchers will be compliant with the NIH's new policies if they report how they intend to balance the use of male and female cells and animals in their proposals. They may also be compliant if they can demonstrate that ""sex-specific inclusion is unwarranted,"" the NIH researchers wrote, ""based on rigorously defined exceptions."" Yet NIH-funded research isn't the only scientific sphere where changes need to occur. ""We don't operate in a vacuum,"" Clayton said. ""The entire scientific community has a stake in this game."" Scientific publishing should also be reformed, she said, because many journals don't require researchers to consider the effect that an animal's sex might have had on their analyses. This won't address all sex differences Furthermore, the NIH changes might not be enough to account for all the sex differences that can influence preclinical research. A study recently published by Mogil's team, for example, demonstrated that male experimenters provoke a fear response in rodents that female scientists do not — meaning an animal killed by a male researcher might present stress-related chemicals in its cells that an animal killed by a female researcher would not. One might therefore argue that the sex of the human who killed the lab mice should also be included in a research proposal, along with the sex of the animals themselves. ""As our biomedical knowledge base grows and technology advances,"" Clayton said, ""smart science reveals gaps."" Because sex and gender differences continue to represent a blind spot for many scientists, more research should look into these differences at the preclinical stage, she said. ""That's why we are calling on scientists to turn their head, and check that blind spot.""",0.5155523426706083,0.48444765732939166,0.8821836807087301,888,5.2646396396396398,452,6.2898230088495577,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Could your cellphone camera give a boost to cryptography programs that help protect your data? That was the pitch that surfaced in a paper this week from a group of researchers at the University of Geneva. The paper studied the visual noise patterns from the camera on a Nokia smartphone, digging deep enough to track quantum fluctuations (tiny, temporary changes in the amount of energy at a point in space). If used right, those fluctuations could provide a source of perfectly random noise that would make a huge difference in future encryption protocols. Traditional computing often has a hard time producing the necessary chaos The group was trying to solve a persistent problem for cryptography software. For encryption to work, it needs a steady supply of random numbers to throw attackers off the scent. Traditional computation often has a hard time providing the necessary chaos. It's a problem that crypto coders have dealt with over and over, developing lots of answers that each come with their own unique weaknesses. One of the NSA's most infamous backdoors, confirmed in December, involved a secret pattern baked into a NIST-approved random-number generator, effectively breaking any program that relied on it. Cellphone cameras could offer a clean way to fix the problem. The solution focuses on camera noise, the pixely haze that appears when you try to take a cellphone picture in low light. It changes from frame to frame, providing an easily accessible source of chaos. It's also remarkably robust, drawing from the perfect randomness of quantum-based fluctuations in the measurement of light. Measuring the noise on the N9 camera, the researchers found the pattern was a close match for the kind of quantum randomness predicted by theoretical physics. According to their data, the camera noise was drilling down to the basic chaotic properties of light itself. ""Random number generation is too important to be left to chance"" That's a potentially powerful tool, but it may be a while before it makes a difference in actual cryptography. The big problem is that, along with randomness, most cryptography problems also require numbers to be ""pseudorandom"" — passing statistical variance tests that genuinely random numbers don’t always pass. Pure chaos is often too messy to be workable. (This irony led to the classic 1969 paper, ""Random number generation is too important to be left to chance."") It's easy to manage in a conventional random number generator, but it means the camera noise would have to be smoothed out through something called a ""whitening"" function. By the end, it might not be any more efficient or powerful than more conventional options. Porting the experiment to other phones might also be tricky since researchers used the Linux-based Nokia N9, which runs on the much-loved but now-abandoned Meego platform. ""The word 'quantum' sucks people's brains out."" But that hasn't stopped cryptographers from dreaming of programs powered by quantum chaos. Silent Circle's Jon Callas calls it ""The Heisenberg-Schrodinger Credulity Effect."" ""The word 'quantum' sucks people's brains out,"" Callas says. ""Once they hear it, they stop thinking."" Still, he admits he's pitched his own camera-powered randomness engines more than a few times, even if they've never come to fruition. More importantly, the idea may be on the right side of history. As more of our communications move to smartphones, encryption programs are following suit, and cryptographers are looking for ways to make use of the new platform's natural advantage. Given the high-ISO cameras that now come standard on even entry-level phones, it's only natural that mobile crypto will start looking to them for random numbers. It’s not practical yet, but it could be soon.",0.523236671128658,0.476763328871342,0.22576605983305487,614,5.2442996742671006,355,6.2028169014084504,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This ability has turned them into darlings of the robotics industry, which has made numerous attempts to reproduce their underwater grasping abilities. Yet, despite all the work that has gone into deciphering the mechanics of octopus suckers, researchers have never asked one seemingly glaring question: how do octopuses avoid getting their suckers stuck to their own skin if they have no idea where their arms are most of the time? According to a new study published today in Current Biology, the answer is chemical. Through a series of experiments, researchers were able to figure out that octopuses produce molecules in their skin that prevent their arms from getting tangled. Moreover, under certain conditions, these animals are able to stop those molecules from doing their thing in order to grasp other octopuses. ""Everybody knew the lack of knowledge in octopus arms, but nobody wanted to investigate this,"" says Guy Levy, a neuroscientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a co-author of the study. ""Now we know that they have a built-in mechanism that prevents them from grabbing octopus skin."" ""The brain wants to grasp the amputated arm, but the arm is refusing."" What is most surprising, however, is that the ""off-switch"" that allows the animals to grasp the skin of other octopuses doesn't work perfectly. In fact, it's pretty glitchy. ""In some cases, when we submitted an amputated arm, the octopus would grab it like any other food item, holding it tightly with a web of skin between its arms,"" Levy says. ""But sometimes the octopus would get close to the arm, dance around it from side to side for a long time — sometime even tens of minutes."" This, Levy says, indicates that there might be an internal conflict in the octopus' nervous system, where the arm — which has its own decentralized nervous system — and the brain are sending different, highly contradictory signals. ""The brain wants to grasp the amputated arm,"" Levy says, ""but the arm is refusing."" To study this phenomenon, the researchers came up with a number of novel experiments, most of which involved watching amputated octopus arms grab various objects. ""An octopus arm is lively for more than an hour after amputation,"" Levy says, and they retain the ability to attach to ""just about anything"" during that period. But even when separated from the rest of its body, octopus arms are still unable to grasp fresh octopus skin — whether it's attached to an octopus or not. ""We thought that the reason might be electrical,"" Levy says, but the amputated arms had no trouble grabbing onto skinned octopus arms, so an electrical mechanism seemed unlikely. In another experiment, the researchers demonstrated that the mechanism wasn't texture or electricity related because the amputated arms couldn't grab ""reconstructed skin"" that had been broken down to its constituent molecules and embedded in a gel. Thus, only one possibility remained: a chemical one. The ""program"" stays on after the arm is amputated Unfortunately, there's still a lot that the researchers don't know. ""We do not know which molecules are involved,"" Levy says, ""but we do know that molecules in the skin are sensed in the suckers and this inhibits the attachment behavior."" This, the researchers think, is a ""built-in program"" that stays on after the arms are amputated. When an arm is still attached to its owner, however, ""the brain can decide to cancel the program and force the arm to grab the skin."" Except that sometimes that doesn't work very well, and octopuses end up ""dancing"" around while their nervous systems figure out how to deal with conflicting signals. ""The finding itself is very interesting, I think,"" says Cecilia Laschi, a biorobotics professor at The Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in Italy who did not participate in this study, but has worked on building an octopus robot. ""It's something that I think nobody investigated before, but in fact the finding is really impressive."" Laschi thinks that reproducing this exact mechanism in soft robots might prove impossible, but researchers could ""use the principle"" to come up with ""some other mechanism for inhibition of the attachment of the suckers."" a surgical tool that avoids certain objects This is something that Levy and his team are already thinking about. Along with a group of European researchers currently running a soft-robotics project called STIFF-FLOP, Levy would like to build a surgical tool that imitates the octopus's ability to preferentially avoid grasping certain objects. ""We are aiming at building a surgical soft-manipulator that might be able to scroll inside the human body while avoiding interactions between arms and parts of the human environment that aren't involved in its tasks — like intestinal walls."" This sort of tool is still a long way off, Levy cautions. Right now, the researchers are hoping to figure out which molecules are at play, and whether other species of octopuses and cephalopods use the same mechanism. ""We are finding more and more surprising information about this animal all the time,"" Levy says. Because of their unique structure, he says, octopuses developed completely new mechanisms over time, so it will take a while before we understand how they all work. ""It is really a special animal.""",0.31568766561622363,0.6843123343837764,0.7956459047895884,907,5.0926130099228226,435,6.2896551724137932,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The specially designed canister, which contains a shipment of Otsuka's Pocari Sweat powder, will mark a disturbing new frontier for humanity: the first commercial product delivered to another world for marketing purposes. The canister will be carried to the lunar surface aboard the first planned private moon-landing mission, set to take place in October 2015. Otsuka says it hopes that the stunt will inspire young people to become astronauts, so they can travel the 380,000 kilometers (236,121 miles) to our closest celestial neighbor, crack open the can, and consume the powder inside. The capsule will be conveyed to the moon by the Falcon 9 rocket. The Falcon 9, designed to be a potentially reusable means of space travel by Elon Musk's SpaceX, has already made three successful supply runs to the International Space Station, but the planned mission in October 2015 would be the first time one of its rockets has successfully provided propulsion to the moon. After the Falcon 9 rocket has ignited its second-stage boosters and completed a four-and-a-half day journey to the moon, the Pocari Sweat-branded canister will be deposited on the surface by private company Astrobotic Technology's ""Griffin"" lander. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology has more important reasons to be up on the moon than to leave a beverage can on its face. The company is angling to win Google's Lunar X prize, a $20-million bounty for the first company to land a device on the moon that can both travel 500 meters on the surface and transmit high-definition pictures back to Earth. Astrobotic's deal with Otsuka will provide them with funds to achieve this goal — the company reportedly charges upwards of half a million dollars for lunar delivery — but the mission to drop a can is somewhat ironic: Astrobotic is a company that develops technologies for clearing space trash. In addition to Pocari Sweat, the titanium capsule will contain the wishes of children from across Asia, obtained from letters sent to the company and etched onto silver disks. The company says that when the project succeeds, Pocari Sweat, with its ambiguous citrus taste, will become the first beverage to reach the surface of the moon. The American makers of another powdered beverage, orange-flavored breakfast drink Tang, may take issue with that claim. NASA chose Tang to fly with its astronauts on a number of missions, but it's unclear if the powder ever actually made its way onto the lunar surface during the Apollo missions.  The titanium can containing the powdered Pocari Sweat was constructed by Singaporean company Astroscale. Otsuka says it can only be unlocked by ""dream rings."" Most of these rings will be given to children whose dreams are to be shot to the moon, while ten will be kept at the company's headquarters, should those children choose earthbound career paths. Otsuka says it wants to show the moon ""a symbol of our precious water."" Either seen as a strange show of Earth's dominance over our only natural satellite, or the end-point of capitalism, this image is disturbing. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets are relatively seasoned space travellers, having completed a set of successful missions. They were designed to be reusable, but the rocket used in the most recent launch was lost at sea in stormy weather. Falcon 9 image published courtesy of SpaceX. Astrobotic Technology's Griffin lander can deliver a payload of up to 260 kilograms (573 pounds). The company says it can land within 100 meters of its target destination, which, for this mission, will be a region on the moon known as Lacus Mortis, or the ""lake of death."" Pocari Sweat may be the first drink to touch down on the lunar surface, but it's certainly not the first brand to use the aspirational power of space travel in its advertising. Brands such as Tang enjoyed increases in their sales as they were selected by NASA to accompany astronauts on extraplanetary missions.

A study  published in The Lancet today explains that although children who use antibiotics are indeed at increased risk for asthma, the antibiotics themselves might not be at fault. Rather, the reason for the connection might have to do with the presence of genetic variants on a specific region of chromosome 17. asthma and early antibiotic use may have the same source In 2007, a study published in the journal Chest strongly suggested that antibiotic use at a young age increased a child's chances of developing asthma at the age of seven. As The New York Times then explained, the researchers thought that the antibiotics might be killing bacteria that contributes to the development of a healthy immune system, in addition to those that are harmful. Since then, however, many studies have struggled to explain the link and conclusively reproduce the findings. But the study published today clarifies the link by suggesting that impaired antiviral immunity and genetic variants on a region of chromosome 17 might be the source of both the asthma and early antibiotic use. To reach this conclusion, scientists examined data from the Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study, a study that followed over 1,000 kids from the moment they were born until they turned 11. The researchers found that two genes on chromosome 17 were associated with an increased risk of antibiotic use in the first year of a kid's life. Moreover, kids who were prescribed antibiotics early on tended to have impaired antiviral immunity later in life. But the researchers did not find a link between the development of allergies and early antibiotic use in children — a finding that would have supported the idea that antibiotics alter gut flora and damage a child's immune system. genetic variants on chromosome 17 Given these results, the researchers conclude that although children who receive antibiotics early on really do tend to develop asthma later in life, genetic variants on chromosome 17 might be the underlying cause. This would mean that the link between antibiotics and asthma might actually be the perfect example of the difference between correlation and causation. The researchers acknowledge, however, that this is only a preliminary finding. Besides antibiotics, a number of other factors have been associated with asthma, including obesity, allergies, and sedentary lifestyles. This means that a lot more work will have to be carried out before scientists can definitely link these genetic variants with asthma. And unfortunately, demonstrating the link with absolute certainty may not be possible at this time, because an exhaustive study on the issue — one that would prevent a large number of children from taking antibiotics in the first year of their lives to see if they later develop asthma — would likely be deemed unethical.",0.47382477335374307,0.5261752266462569,0.8344240994303709,489,5.1247443762781186,228,6.083333333333333,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Those researchers have been studying her remains in the years since, and now her skeleton is helping to settle a big debate: the question of where the earliest Americans actually came from.   ""This is one step toward resolving that question.""The going theory is that the first Americans, known as Paleoamericans, came from Beringia — a northern area that includes the land bridge once connecting Russia and Alaska. But skeletons found throughout the Americas have posed a problem: these early Americans don't resemble modern Native Americans, nor the Siberians from which they're believed to have descended. That's left open the possibility that a second migration of humans from some other region also populated the Americas. ""Were they separate immigrations,"" asks research leader James Chatters, ""or was evolution the issue?"" This new skeleton, said to be one of the six oldest ever found in the Americas, serves as some of the best evidence yet toward confirming the latter: that the first Americans did in fact come from Beringia and later evolved features distinct from modern Native Americans. ""This expedition produced some of the most compelling evidence to date of a link between Paleoamericans … and modern Native Americans,"" Chatters says in a statement. Naia skeleton diving photosPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext That's because the skeleton, which the researchers have named Naia, has features distinct from modern Native Americans but can also be linked to them through DNA — something that hasn't been possible with earlier remains. Naia was also found in the south of Mexico, in the Yucatán Peninsula, which is far lower in the Americas than similar skeletons found so far, furthering the evidence that Paleoamericans hailed from a single origin and continued to travel. ""We had no idea what we might find when we initially entered the cave.""This isn't a smoking gun for that theory, but it furthers its case. ""This is one step toward resolving that question,"" Chatters says. ""This is only one step and only one individual."" The researchers' findings are begin published today in the journal Science. Though Chatters is quick to hedge those results based on this work's sample size of just a single skeleton, it's still a big step toward answering a question that he's been looking into for nearly two decades. He was one of the leaders behind the 1996 discovery of and research on Kennewick Man — a skeleton over 7,000 years old that was found in Washington state and posed these same questions of ancestry. ""For the nearly 20 years since Kennewick Man turned up,"" he says, ""I've been trying to understand why they look so different."" His break came in 2007, when a group of divers discovered the pit that Naia fell into, known as Hoyo Negro (""black hole"" in English), and found her skull near the bottom of the 100-foot-deep, bell-shaped cavern. ""We had no idea what we might find when we initially entered the cave, which is the allure of cave diving,"" Alberto Nava, part of the Bay Area Underwater Explorers team that first found Naia, says in a statement. To access the cave, the divers had to climb down a 30-foot ladder and then swim through 200 feet of tunnel before coming to the pit. Before Hoyo Negro was underwater, it was more than just Naia that fell into it. Many animals fell in too, and researchers found in the pit the bones of sabertooth tigers, pumas, coyotes, and sloths, among other animals. Naia is believed to have been 15 or 16 years old when she fell in, and researchers say that may have happened anywhere between 12,000 and 13,000 years ago. Most of the skeleton still remains in the cave today, but due to unauthorized divers coming in and tampering with various remains, the researchers felt it necessary to remove Naia's skull along with four other pieces just this March.",0.336046665276341,0.663953334723659,0.8597151165110398,708,4.9646892655367232,379,5.8970976253298151,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Foursquare launched a similar service that tracks your location and pushes alerts to your phone when it detects you are near something of interest. Datzing, a new service developed by ex-Vertu designer Frank Nuovo and launching for Android later this year, promises to take that idea even further by making it easier for businesses and groups to broadcast messages to passersby. Datzing's system essentially behaves the same way as Apple's iBeacon: when a user is in range of a beacon, their phone will receive a notification in the Datzing app. The difference with Datzing and iBeacon is that Datzing is not limited to Apple's ecosystem and doesn't actually require an investment in any hardware to set up a beacon.  Any Wi-Fi network or Bluetooth device can be used as a Datzing beacon, including deactivated cellphones The service's hook is that it lets users set up any existing Wi-Fi or Bluetooth device as a beacon that can broadcast information to users of the app that are within its proximity. Older cellphones with Bluetooth aren't required to have active service plans to work as a Datzing beacon, giving those old, discarded flip phones a new lease on life. (Datzing estimates that there are hundreds of millions or even billions of older phones and devices not currently being used that can be repurposed as beacons.) The actual technology behind the service is patent pending, but Datzing says that it uses publicly identifiable information from the Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth devices to register them on its network. It also notes that no personal information is captured or broadcast by its service. Zings can be images, links, coupons, or other data Users that have created Datzing accounts and have the app installed on their phones can choose what categories of zings (the pieces of data broadcasted by beacons in Datzing's world) will be received by their phones. Zings can be anything from a basic link to a website, to a social media profile or image, to a coupon. The zings are collected passively by the app once the user is within range and there is no need to open the app to receive them. Users can then review the zings collected by the app at their leisure. There is also a live mode, which displays all of the currently broadcasting beacons in an area, regardless of category, and ranks them by proximity to the user. None of this requires a GPS lock or even a cellular connection — the entire service is dependent on WI-Fi and Bluetooth signals. The Datzing app also allows users to manage which devices are beaconing under their account. A Wi-Fi network or Bluetooth device can be added to an account and set up to broadcast as a beacon within moments. Datzing is encouraging business owners and others to ""reserve"" their Wi-Fi networks as beacons even if they don't intend to use the service so as to prevent others from taking them over. There is a provision within the app to report beacons that are being used inappropriately, but the potential for abuse by spammers is still there. Datzing's goal is for businesses and private clubs to use the service as an advertising or selling tool. The app and the first beacon will be offered for free. The company intends on charging fees for subsequent beacons added to an account, though it is not releasing pricing details at this time. Datzing's biggest challenge will be getting users to sign up The biggest challenge for Datzing is the same as any other new service — it's going to be difficult to get people to sign up for and use the app to even see the zings that are being broadcast around them. Datzing hopes that its broad compatibility and ease of use will spark adoption through word of mouth. The company also plans to partner with businesses and groups to expand the number of beacons transmitting zings. Datzing is taking sign ups for testers at datzing.com starting today, and it intends to launch the beta version of the app in March. A final release is scheduled for later this year. Though Datzing will initially launch on Android, the company is working on getting the service out to other platforms, including iOS.",0.49511446996157477,0.5048855300384252,0.8760218524032339,758,4.844327176781003,342,6.1637426900584797,0,0,"Apps, Business, Google, Tech",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Earlier today Nintendo slashed its sales forecast for the Wii U by nearly 70 percent, which in turn led the company to predict an operating loss of around $336 million. And it appears that drastic change has forced the company to rethink how it does business. ""We are thinking about a new business structure,"" Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said at a press conference in Japan earlier today. ""Given the expansion of smart devices, we are naturally studying how smart devices can be used to grow the game-player business. It's not as simple as enabling Mario to move on a smartphone.""  It's not clear specifically what Iwata means by using smartphones to grow its business, but the company has previously been reticent about the idea of releasing games on mobile platforms, believing that it would lead to short term profits at the expense of long term growth. ""If we stay in one place, we will become outdated."" ""If we think 20 years down the line, we may look back at the decision not to supply Nintendo games to smartphones and think that is the reason why the company is still here,"" Iwata told the Wall Street Journal last June. Of course, the poor sales of the Wii U — not to mention the decreased sales forecast for the 3DS, which was cut from 18 million units to 13.5 million — in no way means the end for Nintendo. But as recently as a month ago it seemed unlikely that the company would deter from its current strategy, and new game releases like Super Mario 3D World and The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds seemed to only emphasize that attitude. Today's sobering news makes the possibility of a major shift seem much more likely, with Iwata finally recognizing the drastically changed landscape for video games.

But just last month, Huehnergarth realized she was wrong.  After following a link sent to a food policy listserv, Huehnergarth stumbled upon a video describing the strategy behind an award-winning mobile app game from Gatorade — called Bolt! — that featured Gatorade-sponsored sprinter Usain Bolt racing through a series of challenges and roadblocks to accumulate points. The game was initially released in 2012, and then updated in April of last year. In that update (which is no longer available in the iTunes store) Bolt needs to pick up Gatorade to supercharge his performance and avoid droplets of water that slow him down. The video that Huehnergarth saw, posted as an accompaniment to the game's bronze prize from the 2013 Interactive Advertising Bureau's MIXX Awards, was pulled from the website after she wrote a blog post earlier this month decrying the game and its underlying strategy. In a copy of the video obtained by The Verge and posted below, however, members of media strategy group OMB (who developed the game) describe Bolt! as ""an entertaining and competitive way to reinforce to teens that consuming Gatorade would help them perform better [...] and that water was the enemy of performance."" ""Marketed to children... for a wide variety of inappropriate uses."" Of course, that's not true for the vast majority of youth. Unless they're hardcore athletes, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends water as a kid's friend, not their enemy, where physical activity is concerned. In a 2011 report, the Academy went so far as to advise against the widespread consumption of sports drinks, noting that the beverages (along with energy brews) are ""marketed to children and adolescents for a wide variety of inappropriate uses."" PepsiCo, which owns Gatorade, itself appears to see the nutritional value in water: the company last year signed onto Michelle Obama's ""Drink Up"" campaign, specifically designed to get people to drink more of it (bottled, of course). ""That's what really galls me,"" Huehnergarth says. ""Pepsi signed onto this initiative, and then under the radar they're still working this other angle with kids."" So is the game a little shady? Sure, particularly given its wild success in engaging its target audience. Bolt! racked up myriad advertising awards, was downloaded 2.3 million times, and saw the Twitter endorsement of celebrities including Justin Bieber and Bolt himself. But in the wild west of food marketing, is it really surprising that a beverage line owned by PepsiCo would decry the health benefits of H2O for the sake of sales? Experts say no — and point out that this instance is only the latest in a series of ploys by food companies to promote their products with ruthless effectiveness, and without much in the way of federal regulation.    Bolt! is far from the first effort by a food company to target youth through gamification, where thinly-veiled advertisements are disguised as entertainment. They've been doing it online for years, points out Jennifer Harris, the director of marketing initiatives at Yale's Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity. Websites like Burger King's ""BK Crown"" or McDonald's ""HappyMeal"" offer colorful, engaging game hubs that feature a bevy of each food chain's offerings, whereas products like Fruity Pebbles cereal and Pop Tarts have dedicated game sites of their very own. Such games are pervasive because they work: users are more engaged, and for longer periods, than they would be during a 30-second TV commercial, and the sites circumvent self-imposed industry regulations about how many food ads (and for what kinds of foods) can appear during children's television programming. ""These games can be accessed from pretty much anywhere."" The push into mobile games, however, is something of a newer phenomenon. ""A few years ago, we never would have seen these games,"" Harris says. ""Now they're everywhere."" Of course, the move to mobile is a logical one: as more kids and teenagers rely on mobile devices, food companies are simply keeping pace with the trend. But Harris, Huehnergarth, and other experts worry that mobile games might become a particularly pernicious phenomenon. ""It's easier for parents to keep track of what a kid is watching on TV, or what they're doing on a computer,"" Harris says. ""It gets a lot more difficult when these games can be accessed from pretty much anywhere."" In perusing the iTunes app store, it's decidedly tricky to figure out which games are sponsored by food companies and which aren't — they all look pretty much the same. But in one study out of the Rudd Center, researchers pulled up 34 iPhone apps for beverages alone, including those designed to promote Coke and Red Bull, as well as eight major fast food companies with at least one mobile app game. A quick scan of apps available today pulls up games including Cheetos' ""App of Massive Distraction"" where players can launch themselves into ""a snack-flinging frenzy"" and M&M's ""Chocolate Factory"" that asks users to help ""guide the candies into the bags."" Both are clearly advertisements, but neither seem nearly as dubious as a game deriding the benefits of water. Whether a game's message is sketchy or not, food companies are largely free to design and promote the apps however they want — and often use celebrity endorsers, or mimic other popular mobile games, to reach a big audience. That's because, despite years of debate over how food is marketed to youth, federal agencies offer little in the way of regulations that would rein in online or mobile promotion.  In large part, the food industry regulates itself through series of agreements reached by major food companies about how they will and won't promote products — particularly those with minimal nutritional value. In 2006, 16 major companies formed the Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative, whereby they committed to improve the standards for ads targeting kids. As part of that initiative, which includes PepsiCo, companies have agreed not to advertise any foods to kids under the age of 12 unless they meet certain nutritional criteria. For PepsiCo, which did not respond to repeated requests for comment via phone and email, the only product that meets the criteria is Quaker Oatmeal. ""Pepsi said they wouldn't market Gatorade to children under 12, period,"" Harris says. ""I imagine that in this instance, they would argue that the game was for a general audience and so it doesn't fall under that agreement. I don't know how they can say that, but that seems to be the message."" The food industry largely regulates itself Food policy experts and government officials have long sought tougher standards, but so far, they haven't had much luck in passing any. In 2010, a series of regulatory guidelines compiled by experts at agencies including the FDA, CDC, and FTC, were submitted to Congress. The guidelines would have strictly limited which foods could be marketed towards youth — excluding even peanut butter — but would also have been, yet again, entirely voluntary. Lobbyists for the food industry pushed back, arguing that the rules would ""virtually end all advertising"" towards those younger than 18. The regulations stalled in Congress, and were just last week ""killed for good,"" Harris says, with a single sentence in the 2014 omnibus spending bill. ""I believe this is a deceptive campaign."" Huehnergarth, for one, isn't quite ready to let that Gatorade advertisement get a free pass from regulators. She last week filed a complaint with the New York State Attorney General, arguing that because the adver-game included a ""deceptive message"" PepsiCo should be fined for false advertising. ""We all know that the role of the industry is to generate profit, and I understand that,"" she says. ""But from a scientific point of view, I believe this is a deceptive campaign — and there should be meaningful accountability for that.""",0.561063097397115,0.438936902602885,0.17540718127412522,1341,5.1282624906785976,705,6.268085106382979,1,0,"Business, Science, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

It's hard to build a backdoor that can only used by the good guys If this fight sounds familiar, it's because much of the 90s was spent on exactly this legal question, a fight that's now known as the Crypto Wars. PGP founder Phil Zimmermann almost went to jail over it. Of course, because it was the 90s, the fight was over desktop hard drives rather than phones, but when the dust settled, the courts ruled it was completely legal and large, reputable companies like Microsoft and Apple started offering full-disk encryption services without anyone making a fuss about it. Julian Sanchez has a great rundown of how it happened and why it was a good decision, but the general punchline is that it's hard to build a backdoor that can only be used by the good guys. It should also be pointed out that Comey's refreshing enthusiasm for warrants is not shared across all federal agencies. Surveillance of this type frequently happens under a much lower legal standard, whether it's a subpoena, a National Security Letter or plain old FISC-approved bulk collection. In fact, programs like that are the biggest reason Apple implemented this encryption in the first place, trying to placate concerns over unauthorized government data collection.

""It's becoming painfully apparent that in order to get [drones] in there, there is going to have to be a fair amount of accommodation, at least in the beginning,"" National Air Traffic Controllers Association representative Chris Stephenson is quoted as saying. That's going to add yet another set of goals for NextGen, an FAA program that promises to create a nationwide satellite-based location tracking system, provide better tools for sharing information, and update aging technology. Launched in 2004, NextGen has made progress on these projects, but it's also been consistently over budget and behind schedule. And large drones — which are currently mostly used for surveillance but could also carry commercial cargo or even wireless internet signals — throw a wrench in its current plans. ""We didn't understand the magnitude to which [drones] would be an oncoming tidal wave, something that must be dealt with, and quickly,"" says NextGen administrator Ed Bolton. An 'oncoming tidal wave' of drones Among other things, the AP says NextGen's planned computer system can't handle the complex flight plans of drones that stay in the air for days, weeks, or someday years (though super-long-range craft like the Facebook ""internet drone"" shown above would likely fly above normal airspace.) Right now, they move slower than commercial planes, creating the risk of an aerial traffic jam. And that's leaving aside the whole problem of creating a certification system comparable to the one for manned planes and their pilots. The situation may be brighter for the drones people are actually worried about right now: small machines that fly under 400 feet, like existing aerial photography craft and Amazon's proposed fleet of octocopters. The FAA currently bans most commercial use of these drones, although many companies have flouted that rule with mixed results. But hobbyists can already fly them in unpopulated areas, and the FAA is supposed to have rules for businesses in place by 2015; it's currently approved some limited use. The agency, once again, appears behind schedule and potentially likely to miss the deadline due to problems figuring out drone certification procedures and making sure they're able to sense and avoid other aircraft. Earlier this month, NASA said it was working on an automated air traffic control system for drones that fly around 400 to 500 feet. Even with these problems unresolved, though, the FAA is much closer to putting small commercial UAVs in the air than larger, high-flying ones.",0.33356729851761957,0.6664327014823804,0.7796257025755574,453,5.3245033112582778,299,6.1337792642140467,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

NPR first reported the news today, saying that Holder would leave as soon as the Senate confirmed a successor, which could happen as late as next year; the White House has since confirmed the news in a statement. Holder took office in 2009, appointed by President Barack Obama in his first term. NPR quotes a former official as saying that Holder wanted to leave before being committed to staying the rest of Obama's second term; he's already one of the longest-serving US attorneys general. This spring, he said he would stay ""well into 2014,"" but declined to be more specific. Holder has focused on civil rights during his tenure, and he's also been part of the broad debate over how government, civil liberties, and technology should intersect. After information about the US drone program leaked in 2013, he was called to explain the rationale behind targeted airstrikes on American citizens. Holder gave the first real confirmation of how many citizens had been killed in these strikes, and he defended the rationale used to carry them out; he's since had to elaborate on the bounds of the drone program. His Justice Department also filed espionage charges against Edward Snowden, the man behind last year's NSA leaks. Early this year, Holder took a firm stance in the case, saying that clemency wasn't an option and urging Snowden to return and plead guilty. And he was criticized (albeit arguably as a political ploy) for targeting hacktivist Aaron Swartz for prosecution, a factor in his January 2013 suicide. At the same time, the Justice Department under Holder has attempted to rein in the American criminal justice system. In 2012, it criticized the Baltimore Police Department for trying to stop citizens from filming police officers. Later, Holder said that the Department of Justice would not challenge state laws legalizing marijuana, despite federal laws that could let it overrule them. After the police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO, he announced a federal investigation into the city police department — one of over 20 police civil rights investigations opened under his watch — and he's spoken about the need to reduce high incarceration rates, which particularly affect racial and ethnic minorities.

Like most bitcoin companies, the Missouri-based startup sprang up out of nowhere. In late 2011, there were rumors of a leap in the technology for mining bitcoin. This technological leap had the potential to create massive profits for miners, as well as massive profits for those selling the new equipment to miners. It was the old selling-pickaxes-during-the-Gold-Rush strategy. Except Butterfly Labs added a twist. They didn't sell pickaxes. They sold preorders for pickaxes. Butterfly Labs promised its technology could mine bitcoins 1,000 times faster Mining is an essential part of bitcoin. It rewards people for using their own computer power to maintain the network. Since Bitcoin has no central processing authority, it relies on the crowd to record transactions, check each others' math, and keep things secure. This is all built into the bitcoin software: miners don't have to actually do anything other than set up a computer and run the program. Back in 2009 when bitcoin first appeared, anyone could run the mining software on an ordinary laptop and crank out 50 bitcoins in a day. As bitcoin became more popular, mining got more competitive. Soon miners started using more powerful graphics cards to mine bitcoin. Then serious miners began to devote racks of computers, like small personal data centers. Because there were so many miners chasing after the same bitcoins, mining got more and more expensive and the returns on investment got smaller and smaller. The bitcoin protocol is also designed to increase the difficulty of mining as time goes on, which further cut into miners' profits. In June of 2012, Butterfly Labs became one of the first pop-up companies to announce a breakthrough in mining technology: application-specific integrated circuits, or ""ASICs,"" designed specifically to mine bitcoin 1,000 times faster. At least two other companies cropped up, promising similar machines. Miners rushed to place preorders. Some became loyal to certain sellers; others hedged their bets by ordering from all three. Whoever got their machines first would reap a windfall in mining profits before the rest of the mining world caught up. Butterfly Labs promised their customers that preorders would ship as soon as possible. But they soon became evasive, issuing a series of shifting dates. At the time, the company told The Verge that the first ASICs would ship by December. Instead, by most accounts, the first shipments started trickling out in April. More than 20,000 customers who paid in full haven't received their orders While some customers received their ASICs — Wired magazine got one — many more started complaining about delayed shipments. Some wondered if the products really existed. Others suspected Butterfly Labs had decided to use the machines to mine bitcoins for themselves. Some forum users claimed to have received their orders; others accused them of being paid by Butterfly Labs. It came out that one of the company's alleged cofounders was on probation after pleading guilty to mail fraud in a lottery scam. Soon, Butterfly Labs was arguably the most controversial company in the bitcoin world after Mt. Gox, the bitcoin exchange that filed for bankruptcy. But while Mt. Gox was merely incompetent, Butterfly Labs may have been malicious. (Plus, they were dicks.) Customers all over the world began lodging complaints with the US Federal Trade Commission. According to the FTC, more than 20,000 customers had received nothing by September 2013 — more than a year after customers' placed their first orders — despite paying upfront for products that ranged from $149 chips to $29,899 machines. That means customers were ripped off for at least $3 million, and that's a low, low estimate, since many customers reported buying the more expensive units, and more orders were placed after September 2013. Update: In total, Butterfly Labs collected between $20 million and $50 million in pre-orders, according to the FTC. Customers who did receive their orders found they were obsolete. A Butterfly Labs representative said the delayed machines were only useful as a ""room heater,"" according to the FTC. The machines were only useful as a ""room heater,"" said one company rep Despite widespread failure to deliver, Butterfly Labs began offering new products and services in 2013: an even more powerful bitcoin miner and a remote mining service. The FTC says the company failed to deliver those, too. Butterfly Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the past, the company has said delays were due to various manufacturing complications. The company has now been shut down pending a court case. ""We’re pleased the court granted our request to halt this operation, and we look forward to putting the company’s ill-gotten gains back in the hands of consumers,"" Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement today. UPDATE, 4:12PM: Butterfly Labs has released a statement: Butterfly Labs is disappointed in the heavy-handed actions of the Federal Trade Commission.  In a rush to judgment, the FTC has acted as judge, jury and executioner, contrary to our intended system of governmental checks and balances. The FTC's current actions are negatively impacting our thousands of customers and our dozens of employees.  Their current media campaign should only further alarm a knowing citizenry and raise questions as to why the FTC wouldn't simply let this case play out through the judicial system. That is what Butterfly Labs intends to do.   It appears the FTC has decided to go to war on bitcoin overall, and is starting with Butterfly Labs.  Butterfly Labs is being portrayed by the FTC as a bogus and fake company.  To the contrary, Butterfly Labs is very real.  As pointed out in court filings Butterfly Labs made last night, Butterfly Labs has shipped more than $33 million in products to customers and voluntarily granted refunds approximating $17 million to customers for cancelled orders.  Butterfly Labs was literally is in the midst of shipping out completed products to fulfill the remaining millions of dollars of orders on our books and issuing requested refunds, when the FTC effectively closed the doors of Butterfly Labs without any chance to be heard in court.   At this time, Butterfly Labs is cooperating fully with the Temporary Receiver appointed by the Court.  A hearing is set for September 29 and Butterfly Labs has asked the Court to allow it to present testimony from key witnesses for the company.  Butterfly Labs intends to defend our business and our nascent and promising industry. The government wants to shut Butterfly Labs down, and we are not going away without a fight to vindicate bitcoin, our company, and our employees.

The agency announced that it was granting six exemptions to its overall ban on commercial drones and waiving requirements that the craft themselves get airworthiness certificates, because there's no larger threat to US airspace or national security. In return, the companies agree that all operators will hold private pilot certificates, the drones will always stay in the line of sight, and flights will be restricted to a ""sterile area"" on the film set. That means they'd effectively be short-range and isolated from areas where they could put people or other aircraft at risk — as some hobbyist drones have done in major cities. ""We are thoroughly satisfied these operations will not pose a hazard to other aircraft or to people and property on the ground,"" says FAA administrator Michael Huerta. These exemptions follow a lobbying push by the Motion Picture Industry of America, which has urged the FAA to allow small drones in filmmaking. The MPAA was responsible for helping six video companies get exemptions: Astraeus Aerial, Aerial MOB, HeliVideo Productions, Pictorvision Inc, RC Pro Productions Consulting/Vortex Aerial, and Snaproll Media. Flying-Cam Inc, known for capturing footage for the James Bond film Skyfall, was asked to provide more information. All these companies specialize in aerial cinematography, which is one of the most promising uses of quadrotors or other small UAVs. They're far cheaper than manned craft, there's little risk to operators, and it doesn't tax the drone's battery or capabilities the way something like Amazon's delivery service might. Though it's dubiously legal, many photographers and filmmakers are already using drones, something that's periodically resulted in accidents and fines — one such fine led to a lawsuit that could potentially invalidate the FAA's ban. The FAA, meanwhile, has already granted a few limited commercial licenses, and it's funding six test sites that will help inform future laws on pilot licensing, aircraft safety requirements, and ways to integrate drones into existing airspace. Congress has told the agency to come up with official rules for small commercial aircraft by 2015, with rules for larger drones — a more difficult problem — to follow over the next several years.",0.623801795696852,0.376198204303148,0.5856517741050802,368,5.3668478260869561,240,6.1833333333333336,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

He even expects to see award-winning feature films made with them some day. ""People will tell you, 'That’s not going to work,' but yeah, that’s going to work,"" Lasseter said during a panel on modern film audiences at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, according to Variety. ""But the reason they say that is because it’s not what they are used to."" There's good reason to trust Lasseter when it comes to disruptive film technologies: as the director of Toy Story, he pretty much proved the value of computer-animated movies.  iPhones have already been used for amazing films Of course, Lasseter's predictions are really already here, at least to a small extent. One of the buzzier films at Sundance this year, Tangerine, was shot almost entirely using an iPhone 5S; Park Chan-wook, the director of Oldboy, shot a short film using an iPhone 4 several years back; and GoPro is already operating an online channel of videos — including short films — shot on its cameras. Those films may not be the type of award-winning features that Lasseter expects to see, but it's already proof that filmmakers are picking up these new tools and creating some incredible work with them. What's most interesting about Lasseter's prediction is that he doesn't just think the iPhone is going to replace the 35mm movie camera (or even the digital movie camera or the DSLR). He thinks that these new tools are going to bring about a change in the way films work. ""[The iPhone and GoPro] give a vibrancy you have never been able to have before … I think a new film grammar is going to come with these things,"" Lasseter said, according to Variety. The ""vibrancy"" Lasseter speaks of may be how personal the films made with these tools can feel. GoPros, in particular, can really convey the intensity of what they're recording because of their first-person perspective. As with prior advances in film, Lasseter expects people to view the adoption and spread of these tools as unnecessary or impossible, but in reality, the tools being discussed are already here, he says. In an example of how filmmakers need to adapt to new tools, Lasseter explained how the ""plastic"" look of computer-generated characters at the time was part of the reason Pixar decided to make a movie featuring characters that were made out of plastic. ""It's one of the reasons we leaned into making toys the subject of our feature film, Toy Story,"" he said. How will filmmaking change to work with these tools? However, for the moment, filmmakers are largely using low-budget cameras to imitate professional cameras, which isn't necessarily what Lasseter is talking about. DSLRs caught on, in part, because they can provide that cinematic depth of field. Smartphones can catch on because they're ubiquitous, but filmmakers are also using add-on lenses, grips, and so on to make their phones into better tools. On the other hand, you can look at the bigger picture: digital has also brought the rise of improvisation and new editing techniques, and consumer cameras have also brought about the found footage craze. We're also now seeing original series on Snapchat, even shot in the — much-derided by traditionalists — portrait format. Perhaps that's a better example of what Lasseter means when he says that filmmakers need to rapidly improve their stories and adapt their techniques. Snapchat may not be the obvious location for an award-winning film to show up, but perhaps Lasseter is still stuck using language that the Academy understands when he speaks of success in terms of a feature.",0.6169189916798826,0.3830810083201174,0.19269398540806126,626,4.9424920127795531,333,5.8858858858858856,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Filmed with a handful of cars and extras from a local motorcycle gang, its low-budget realism translated into focused, powerful action sequences that most Hollywood choreography still can’t match. But it’s the sequel, The Road Warrior, that people remember. Director George Miller took the core elements of Mad Max and made everything bigger: biker gangs became futuristic tribes, and chases turned into outright warfare, culminating in an extended battle so chaotic that we needed a diagram to explain it. A few years after that, Miller decided to go even bigger, but we ended up with Beyond Thunderdome, a film that stripped out a lot of what made the series great in the first place — namely, the car chases. It took 30 years, but George Miller is back, and he’s promised to deliver what we all really want: a movie that is, as he put it, “almost a continuous chase.” It’s possible to look at parts of Mad Max: Fury Road and just see a bigger, more elaborate version of its 1980s predecessors — which isn’t a bad thing. But like the survivors of its blasted wasteland, it’s also a movie that seems intent on leaving the past behind. Fury Road is what happens when retro pulp meets social progress. And that’s the whole reason it works. Warning: minor spoilers for Mad Max: Fury Road ahead. Except for a 15-minute introduction, Miller keeps his promise in Fury Road. The film is one big run through a post-apocalyptic desert, which is — as usual — now ruled by a coterie of metalheads and wrestling champions. (What kind of apocalypse? All of them, basically, from peak oil to nuclear war to unspecified ""sourness."" Fury Road rightly keeps it vague.) The grizzled Max Rockatansky is now played by Tom Hardy instead of Mel Gibson, but his antagonist — a skull-masked despot named Immortan Joe — is played by the actor behind Mad Max’s lead villain. The film’s dusty, cobbled-together props and costumes are drawn straight from The  Road Warrior. Fury Road drops the ‘80s big hair and headbands, but overall, it’s amazing how well the aesthetic has held up. Fury Road, though, effectively dispenses with the chronology and backstory of Mad Max. Max refers to himself as a ""cop,"" but unlike Mel Gibson, there’s just no way Tom Hardy is old enough to have lived through the apocalypse. His antagonists, however, are still rooted in the same old world. Immortan Joe and his fellow warlords decorate themselves with the medals of long-dead militaries, adopt Roman titles, and resurrect Norse mythology. Joe is a traditionalist who has reduced women to breeding stock and men to devoted killing machines, clamoring to be chained to their cars with an IV drip of human blood. His society isn’t just what we expect from Mad Max, it’s our collective vision of the post-apocalypse: a few strong men (always men) mastering the weak, returning humanity to a state of nature. Max Rockatansky’s type has become its own cliche over the past few decades: the bereaved, stubbly man seeking vengeance for his murdered wife and child. Here, he’s haunted by the literal specter of his daughter, who appears in sudden flashbacks with the pale skin and hollow eyes of a Japanese horror film ghost. I have no idea how she died or why she existed at all, except to live on as an unusually creepy angst generator. But Max isn’t the driving force — or even, arguably, the protagonist — of Fury Road. That role belongs to Furiosa (Charlize Theron), Immortan Joe’s trusted imperator. The film’s bloody hunt, which will eventually involve dozens of cars and at least five separate factions, starts when Furiosa escapes in a ""guzzoline"" truck with Immortan Joe’s five enslaved wives, intent on finding freedom at a distant oasis. Not only does she set the plot in motion, she owns the frenetic first chase sequence, which Max spends as a bound captive of Joe’s literally bloodthirsty fighters. The pair quickly form a reluctant alliance, but she’s the one whose emotional journey we follow, while Max remains taciturn and enigmatic. Max was a lone savior in The Road Warrior, a self-sufficient misanthrope who chooses to stop and help some desperate survivors. Here, he’s just as desperate as anyone else, one of many survivors who have lost everything — even his iconic leather jacket and V8 Interceptor. He’s also, for most of the film, surrounded by women. I don’t think they get a majority of total speaking roles, but that’s only because the antagonists are uniformly aging patriarchs and their metaphorical sons. On the heroes’ side, Max and another male character are far outnumbered by Furiosa, Joe’s wives, and a group of female bikers. It's still an overwhelmingly white cast for a story that's written as mythic and universal, but after watching film after film reduce women’s roles to tokens, it feels like dropping into a mirror universe. What’s really fascinating is how casually Fury Road throws this in, and how willingly it abandons some of pulp’s most pervasive gender tropes. The film’s entire plot is about five beautiful young women escaping sexual servitude, but it’s a film during which sexual peril virtually never comes up — and when it does, it’s instantly subverted. Female characters are shot, stabbed, and run over just like male ones, but they’re never singled out by leering villains or treated like prizes. And while women might be property under Immortan Joe’s patriarchy, men are disposable, and just as tightly controlled. Rape, and gendered abuse in general, is such a standard part of ""gritty"" genre fiction that it’s often almost invisible; among other things, it helped drive both Mad Max and The Road Warrior. When it’s recognized, it’s usually defended as a touch of realism. That isn’t the case here — if anything, it would dilute Fury Road’s pure chaos. George Miller’s chase scenes are based on the idea that everyone, no matter how powerful, is only a falling rock or stray bullet away from the same grisly death. By the same token, nobody, no matter how powerless, is harmless. Even if you’re part of a warlord’s harem, there’s a reason you’ve managed to outlive almost every other human being on Earth. This isn’t just nice, or politically correct, it’s necessary. Creating one good action scene is hard. Creating two hours’ worth of them, based mostly on a formula that was developed in 1981, is harder. And filling those two hours with stunts from the same small group of haunted men and alpha brutes would be damn near impossible. Fury Road stretches the limits of Miller’s capabilities; there are only so many ways to kill someone on, around, or under a motor vehicle, and I think he’s figured out most of them. In its weakest moments, Fury Road relies on Hollywood set pieces that feel out of place with the film’s physical choreography, like a giant sandstorm. In the strongest, you have no idea which of the dozen distinct characters on screen might suddenly attempt a knuckle-biting stunt on top of a moving truck. Once they’re together, Max and Furiosa effortlessly tag-team fight and chase scenes, even when they’re clearly thinking about killing each other. Max has had plenty of sidekicks, but this might be his first partner — the modern counterpart to his 20th-century man. During a rare lull in Fury Road, an escaped wife asks a female biker if she’s shot people. ""I thought girls were above that,"" she says, upon learning that she has. The bemused response is a lot like my own when people worry about ""taking the fun"" out of action movies. I came to Fury Road for the crashes, the guns, Charlize Theron’s robot arm, and the villain who lives in a skull mountain and takes his own rock band into battle. The fact that it treats more characters like people, not props, doesn’t diminish any of that. Mad Max isn't ""growing up,"" it's just getting bigger. Fury Road is still part of an old world — a continuation of a decades-old franchise, not a revolutionary development. But it’s also proof that we can keep the wild, over-the-top fun of aging pop culture without recreating its social roles. In fact, abandoning them might be the best thing we could possibly do.",0.48083502305555603,0.519164976944444,0.16047178130511622,1423,4.952916373858046,774,6.2906976744186043,1,12,"Culture, Entertainment, Movie Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Today it's time for CBS to make a splash, and they've released the first looks for both Supergirl and the upcoming Limitless TV show. The Supergirl trailer seems devoted as much to defending itself from early criticisms as it does to actually setting up the show. Calista Flockhart's character goes on an extended speech about how the name ""Supergirl"" — instead of ""Superwoman"" — shouldn't be taken as a pejorative. ""So if you perceive 'Supergirl' as anything less than excellent, then isn't the real problem you?"" she asks Kara Danvers (Melissa Benoist), Supergirl's civilian alter ego. Of course, the show almost certainly isn't going with the naming convention to make some broader statement about empowering women; it's doing so because that's the name of the comic book it's adapting. Given that, it's hard to read the scene as anything more than a cynical attempt to pre-empt further furor over the name — particularly given the frothy, CW-style romantic comedy tone the show appears to be taking.   Limitless fares slightly better, if only because it leans heavily on the appearance of Bradley Cooper, who will be appearing in the show. Other well-regarded actors like Jennifer Carpenter (Dexter) and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (The Abyss) also elevate the concept, which still comes down to a guy taking a pill that makes him super smart and a really good fighter. Of course, all of these various clips could play differently in context, so it's important to give the shows a shot when they finally hit the air later this year.

One of the groups in front of us had blocked the path, so our guide was forced to steer us into riskier waters. The rock wasn’t enormous, but our speed and the impact were enough to send me backwards over the side.   The moment that my raft-mate pulled me back in, my mind was focused on only one thought:  “I hope I got that shot.”  Strapped to my hand was GoPro’s new camera: the $399 Hero 4 Session, available next week. It’s cube-shaped and measures less than 1.5 inches long on every side. It shoots 1440p video at 30 frames per second, 1080p up to 60 frames per second, and 720p up to 100 frames per second. It’s waterproof up to 10 meters so it doesn’t require a bulky housing, which made it the perfect camera to stick on the hand that I was using on top of my paddle. It got the shot.   The Session is extremely simple to use: you start and stop it with just one press of a button. In fact, the Session only has two buttons. The main one is a red, circular button found on the top side of the camera. Tap it, and the Session turns on and starts recording. Tap it again to stop recording, and the Session turns off.   This helps with battery life — a problem GoPro has long battled with its cameras. The Session’s internal battery should last between one to two hours running consistently, but turning it on and off each time stretches the battery life much further. When I started the hour-and-a-half rafting trip, the Session had two-thirds of its battery life remaining, and by the end, it had outlasted a fully charged Hero 4 Black and Hero+ LCD. A 3-second press-and-hold on the main button will trigger a time-lapse photo mode. If you want to shoot single or burst photos, however, you have to change to these modes in the GoPro app. The only other button on the Session is for turning the camera’s Wi-Fi on and off.   In fact, to change any settings on the Session, you have to use GoPro’s app or the included Wi-Fi remote. That’s probably for the best, considering there are only two buttons and just one tiny screen on the camera. But GoPro has improved the ease of its on-camera menu system over the years, so if you’ve gotten used to changing your settings on the fly, it could take some time to acclimate to the Session. One of the biggest benefits of the Session’s small size is how much harder it is to notice, no matter where you mount it. GoPro has also slimmed down its cameras over the years — the Hero 4 Black and Silver, in particular, are very light and small — but when you snap them into a housing and mount them to a helmet or to your wrist, you definitely still feel them when you’re moving around. The Hero 4 Session is waterproof out of the box The Session, on the other hand, is waterproof out of the box. It does use a small skeleton case (much like the frame mount the company sells for its bigger Hero cameras, but cubed) in order to attach it to the various mounts. I mounted it to my hand during our rafting trip and could barely feel it as we sped down the river. A bigger Hero 4 stuck inside a waterproof housing would have been much more cumbersome. Ditching the need for a housing also solves another long-standing problem with GoPro's cameras: the audio. The Session has two microphones — one on the front, and one on the back — and it dynamically switches between them to reduces wind noise. They never get muffled, and they're built to drain liquid fast, so the audio even sounds good when the camera comes out from underwater. As small as it looks on its own, when you place a Session next to a naked Hero 4 Black or Silver, they don’t look that much different. Put them in their various mounts and cases, though, and you can’t help but notice how much space the Session saves you.   GoPro CEO Nick Woodman says the company worked on the Hero 4 Session for three years, but some tradeoffs still had to be made in order to condense it to such a small size. It can’t shoot in 4K. It can’t shoot in incredibly high frame rates such as 120 or 240 frames per second, which limits your options for shooting in slow motion. And it only takes 8MP still photos — a resolution your phone can likely match or beat. If you don’t already own an action camera, the Session might not be the first one to buy. For example, there’s GoPro’s own Hero 4 Silver, which is priced the same and is definitely more robust. The Silver has a built-in touchscreen LCD screen, can shoot video up to 2.7K at 30 frames per second, and at 720p can shoot in 120 frames per second slow motion. The Hero 4 Silver also shoots higher resolution stills — 12MP to the Session’s 8MP — and can take them much faster, reaching speeds of up to 30 images per second. But there’s a lot to love about the size and simplicity of the Session. It fits in so many more places, the battery will last longer than any other GoPro (though it can’t be swapped), and if you’re not obsessive about frame rates and resolutions you’ll probably be just fine with the excellent 1080p/1440p footage it does capture. All of this is certainly the bet that GoPro is making with the Session. ""I think this is going to expand our customer base,"" Woodman says. ""I think a lot of people still scratch their head when they look at our cameras."" Other action camera companies have a hard time keeping up with GoPro’s high-end cameras, but they still offer some competition at the low end. Garmin’s new VIRB X ($299) and XE ($399) cameras offer similar shooting capabilities as the Session, and Sony offers a number of good options at different price points. Where GoPro still wins is the ecosystem. GoPro maintains a robust line of accessories and mounts for its cameras, and the third-party market for accessories is deep. It’s similar to buying a particular brand of camera body because you like the lenses the company makes. Choosing a GoPro competitor likely means you’re limiting the flexibility of shooting with an action camera. The Session slots right into that ecosystem. For some, it will be the smaller and longer-lasting camera they’ve been looking for. For others, it might be the dead simple action camera they’re finally ready to use. Either way, this little camera is about to turn a lot of heads.",0.48993650229733166,0.5100634977026683,0.19262170829249925,1177,4.4511469838572646,525,5.6209523809523807,0,47,"Photography, Tech, Hands-on, Photo Essay",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell The Verge that the company is currently working on final copies of Windows 10, with a release to manufacturing (RTM) build expected later this week. RTM candidate builds have already been spotted online. Once the RTM build is ready, Microsoft will send the final copy of Windows 10 to its PC partners ahead of a release to the public on July 29th. ""We will never be done."" While the RTM process has been a significant milestone for previous releases of Windows, it’s more of a minor one for Windows 10. Microsoft is moving Windows 10 to a ""Windows as a service"" model that means the operating system is regularly updated. That’s part of the reason Windows 10 is considered the ""final version of Windows,"" as regular updates means it’s never really finished. ""We will never be done,"" explained Windows chief Terry Myerson last week, and we’ll start to see future Windows 10 updates roll out regularly in the coming months. Those include extensions support for Microsoft’s Edge browser and many app updates for the built-in Windows 10 applications. An example of Microsoft’s rapid progress with Windows 10 can be seen in recent builds that the company has provided to testers. Microsoft released three separate versions of Windows 10 last week (build 10158, 10159, and 10162) and each contained minor improvements. While there’s still a debate around the readiness of Windows 10, Microsoft has been squashing hundreds of bugs in the OS in just a week. Driver problems and other software bugs still remain on some systems, but the RTM milestone won’t mean these stay a problem for long. Once Microsoft has finalized Windows 10 this week the company will continue to work on bug fixes ready for the July 29th release date. Windows 10 testers will get a copy of the final version first, and the company will be rolling out the OS to the public in waves starting on July 29th.

Many of us opt for the latter, but scanning apps can be clunky, and sometimes produce unreadable images, which completely defeats the purpose of using one. The newest version of the Scanner Pro app, which came out this week for iOS users, suffers none of those problems and even offers a few clever options that make scanning documents even easier. Scanner Pro 6 is a really good scanning app at the most basic level. You don't need to perfectly line up the document, because the app can recognize its edges and conform the resulting image into a more perfect rectangle. It adjusts the brightness and contrast so that, even if you're taking a picture in a room with muddy lighting, you'll be able to read what's on the sheet of paper you're scanning. You don't even need to tap the screen to capture — Scanner Pro 6 can automatically scan what's in front of your phone and save it, which allows you to quickly scan multiple documents. Scan from your lock screen without even opening the app You can do similar things with other apps, such as Evernote’s Scannable or Microsoft’s Office Lens, but what makes Scanner Pro different is its new Scan Radar feature. Scan Radar removes the need to launch the app to scan something. Instead, you can just activate your phone's camera from the lock screen and photograph a document, and when you open the app later it will alert you that it has a new scan ready for you. Scanner Pro 6's competitors might be free, but Scan Radar alone might be worth paying for if you do a lot of scanning. There's also plenty of integration with services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Evernote, and now One Note and One Drive. You can email, fax, or print the scans, too.

This past Friday, it appears, Instagram has started addressing that very issue, as photos sent to the popular image sharing app are now being stored in a higher 1080 x 1080 size. The higher-resolution pictures are not yet being displayed as such by Instagram, which maintains its smaller default for now. But a quick check of the source code on Instagram's web view reveals that new photos uploaded to it are being saved in 1080px resolution, likely in preparation to making a full and public switch to the greater size in the coming days or weeks. We have reached out to Instagram to find out more. The company's last comments on the matter indicated that it neither uploads nor stores images at any greater resolution that its standard 640 x 640, so this is clearly a new development. Verge reader Alejandro de la Torre was among the first to spot the larger Instagrams, stumbling upon the bigger preview when he received a link via Telegram. It's important to note that these aren't merely 640px images stretched out to fill the larger size; we are looking at legitimate 1080px photos, with a quality reasonably close to the original. It's too soon to say whether Instagram's persistent issue of over-compressing images coming from its Android app has been addressed, but both Android and iOS uploads are being stored in the higher res now. Check out a few of our latest posts on Instagram below, accompanied by their larger, more beautiful versions. To uncover your own 1080px photos, use a desktop browser like Chrome or Firefox to open up an Instagram photo page's source HTML code, then search for "".jpg"" within it. The first result should be the URL to the larger version of the picture. Update, 6 July, 1:45PM ET: An Instagram spokesperson tells us that the company started ""gradually rolling out 1080 across iOS and Android"" last week, meaning that most people should already be seeing the higher-resolution images in the mobile app. Alas, Instagram on the desktop remains a second-class citizen, as Instagram says that ""right now we are focused on mobile, with no plans to share on web.""

Oh, and it's also available to buy if you've got $5,000 to spare. A walking tank from an alternate history WWI It's the creation of Michael Sng, a toymaker from Singapore who was previously the lead product designer for the STIKFAS range of action figures. The walking tank is the first in Sng's ambitious Codename Colossus project, a ""made-to-order, kinetic toy line set in Europe in an alternate history during The Great War."" Although Sng's website doesn't offer much detail on this fictional backdrop, the Boudicca itself reminds us of the steampunk universe of Scott Westerfeld's Leviathan novels, where giant iron mechas battle it out with bio-engineered beasts of war in an alternate history WWI. Thankfully, detailed photos of the Boudicca showing its spotlights, machine guns, and cannons, do just as good a job of bringing Sng's model to life.

The expanded testing, which arrived on the heels of $28 million in new funding raised from Goldman Sachs and others, comes in the midst of a national discussion over the proper role of genetic testing in preventative medicine. Counsyl’s take is summed up by its new tagline — ""It’s good to know."" But is it? As the price of mapping an individual human genome has rapidly declined, companies have sought to profit by offering low-cost genetic tests to consumers through the mail and retail outlets. Last fall the Food and Drug Administration ordered 23AndMe to stop selling its DNA test kit out of concern that the company had marketed its products without necessary regulatory approvals. The crackdown spooked the industry, and the FDA followed up with similar letters to companies including Illumina, Decode Genetics, Navigenics, and Knome Inc. An industry that is changing quickly Founded in 2008, Counsyl has sought to differentiate itself from companies that scan your entire genome by offering people medical information they can take action on. Its tests require physician approval, and they’ve been designed to help patients make decisions about reproduction and mastectomies that could preempt breast cancer. The company has screened more than 250,000 people to date, mostly prospective parents who want to learn about their risk of passing on rare inherited diseases to a child. Now the company is offering patients the chance to learn about their inherited cancer risk in hopes of helping them detect any abnormalities early and take appropriate action. Some users of the service who are at high risk of breast cancer, for example, have elected to undergo double mastectomies. With insurance, the test costs between $150 and $300 — it’s $999 without — putting this form of screening within reach of more Americans than ever before. (In recent years, getting your genome scanned has cost $3,000 to $4,000.) Ramji Srinivasan, Counsyl’s co-founder and CEO, says the company’s focus on involving doctors both before and after the test mark an improvement over some of its rivals. After receiving test results through the company’s website, patients are given the option to talk to a licensed counselor. ""We think it’s important for anybody to understand this kind of vital information,"" Srinivasan says. ""But we want them to have the appropriate context and care during the process."" How can companies avoid causing harm? The question is what constitutes appropriate context and care. There’s still no real consensus about which populations should submit themselves for genetic screening, how those results should be presented, and what actions patients should take as a result. ""This is one of the biggest issues in thinking through how we’re going to translate all of the information coming from the mapping of the human genome into clinical and public health practice,"" says Barbara Koenig, a professor of medical anthropology and bioethics at the University of California at San Francisco. ""How to avoid doing it prematurely. How to do it thoughtfully. How to enable people’s real choices. How not to cause harm."" Those issues were up for debate in San Francisco last week in a series of lectures at UCSF with leading bioethicists. Wylie Burke, who leads the Department of Bioethics and Humanities at the University Of Washington, outlined a number of concerns that the medical community is working through when it comes to genetic testing. ""The question is begged whether it’s okay for consumers to just buy whatever they want,"" she said. ""I think it’s first of all a safety issue, and it’s perhaps a truth-in-advertising issue."" Margaret Lock, a medical anthropolgist at McGill University, described a study of people who had undergone genetic screening for their likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease. It found that many patients expressed confusion about what their results meant, and that few of them made changes to their lifestyle that could reduce their risk of developing the disease. Counsyl’s results are delivered via a secure website with a clean, modern design heavy on white space. The full report on your genetic screening contains a list of diseases and the relative risk that either you or your child will contract it, expressed as a fraction of the population: ""less than 1 in 210,000,"" for example. Clicking on a disease will offer you more information on the disease’s symptoms and how they are treated. It can be difficult, looking at the table of results, to know what to make of the fact that you have (say) a 1 in 3,600 chance of passing cystic fibrosis on to your child. Counsyl says that’s where its genetic counselors come into play. ""We need public deliberation."" But that raises questions of its own. Taking up doctors’ time to review test results when the patient has no basis for concern could create what Burke calls ""a raiding the commons problem."" Surely, a large number of patients will benefit from learning the results of their genetic makeup. But doctors will have to learn how to balance their existing responsibilities with the need to review the results of patients’ genetic screening tests. Most sensitively, there are the issues around how genetic information is used in reproduction. Counsyl’s genetic counselors walk patients at high risk of passing on inherited diseases through a range of options: in-vitro fertilization, so-called ""watchful waiting,"" adoption, and abortion. But as the power of genetic screening to predict other traits and conditions improves, issues around eugenics are primed to explode in the public discourse. ""I don’t think we have a societal consensus about that,"" Burke said. ""That’s clearly something where we need public deliberation."" Counsyl isn’t what the FDA calls a ""direct to consumer"" product — it requires a doctor’s note to purchase the test. And the founders say their sole focus is to develop tests that improve patient outcomes. ""Our love is for useful clinical information — the things that can actually impact patients’ decisions,"" Srinivasan says. That’s one reason the company tests for specific risks instead of scanning the patient’s entire genome. ""We would not want to offer a test like that — that has no clinical utility,"" he says. But as testing improves, our opinions about which tests have ""clinical utility"" may change rapidly. Tests like the ones Counsyl provides are proving a boon to thousands of people looking for information about potentially fatal conditions. But they’re also raising questions that remain very much unanswered.",0.6259248918429594,0.3740751081570406,0.8489692216828916,1106,5.2811934900542497,563,6.4884547069271754,0,0,"Science, Tech, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

MERS was first identified in 2012, but this March saw a surge in cases for reasons that remain unclear. Since then, there have been a total of 538 laboratory-confirmed cases of the virus globally, 450 of which have been in Saudi Arabia. In roughly one-third of infections, the virus proves fatal. ""Unwelcome but not unexpected news."" CDC Director Tom Frieden described the latest case as ""unwelcome but not unexpected news."" The patient had traveled from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on May 1st, stopping through London, Boston and Atlanta before arriving in Orlando, Florida, where he was hospitalized. While the patient was symptomatic during the flights, researchers emphasize that there is no evidence yet that he was infectious. According to the CDC, his current condition is ""stable and doing well."" ""Infection control is really critical."" The hospital is using airborne isolation tactics, as recommended by the CDC, but Frieden emphasized that ""our experience with MERS suggests that the risk to the general public is very low."" Researchers say the virus does not spread easily from person-to-person, typically spreading only through close contact, usually through living with or caring for an infected person. At the same time, once a person does become infected, doctors face limited treatment options. ""This is not a virus we can treat with specific antivirals right now,"" Assistant Surgeon General Anne Schuchat told reporters, ""so infection control is really critical."" At the same time, the Indiana case appears to be winding down. The Washington Post reports that the patient has made a full recovery, and the case seems to have been entirely contained. The CDC investigation is ""relatively complete,"" and hasn't turned up any secondary cases.

Governor Peter Shumlin signed the law on Thursday, setting the stage for a major battle between activists and food manufacturers. As The Economist notes, Vermont is home to more organic farms than any other state per capita, and it's the first state to take such a firm stance on the issue. Connecticut and Maine each have labeling laws that will only trigger if and when neighboring states put similar regulations in place. Supporters claim labels aid transparency and will only lead to greater consumer choice. Opponents maintain that GMOs are perfectly safe for consumption and point to studies that have failed to establish them as a threat to humans and the environment. Consumers have always been able to avoid genetically modified foods simply by picking organic products, critics point out. They insist a mandated label program will drive up prices at the supermarket and fear shoppers will unfairly view the text — ""produced with genetic engineering"" — as some kind of warning. Proud to sign #GMO labeling into law in #vt. Those opposed will put up a fight. Help us fight back. #righttoknow http://t.co/BSh2aTKY2g Vermont's decision is a significant victory for the pro-label group, though it's expected to meet stiff resistance and no shortage of legal challenges. ""Today, we are the first state in America that says simply, 'Vermonters have spoken loud and clear: We want to know what's in our food,'"" Shumlin said upon signing the law. ""We are pro-choice. We are pro-information,"" he said, highlighting Vermont's history of leading the way on important issues like same-sex marriage and the banning of slavery. ""We will win the food fight."" Clearly the bill's advocates expected a fight all along; a website where taxpayers can donate to cover legal costs has already been launched. Activists seem to have momentum on their side. Led by Chipotle, more restaurants are increasing transparency around foods that contain GMOs.

Both groups of researchers conclude that global warming is accelerating the disintegration of large parts of the ice sheets, and that the melting that is already under way is likely unstoppable. This, the researchers say, will eventually cause global sea levels to rise by at least 10 feet. The first study, published today in Science by researchers at the University of Washington, used computer modeling and topography maps to conclude that the collapse of the Thwaites Glacier, an extremely large glacier flowing into Pine Island Bay, is already underway. This process, the researchers say, could be completed within the next few centuries and would cause the ocean to rise by nearly 2 feet. Furthermore, because that glacier is currently acting as a barrier for the rest of the ice sheet, its collapse could ultimately trigger a 10-13 foot rise in global sea levels.  Both studies fundamentally agreeIn contrast, the NASA study, which has been accepted for publication in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, is predicting a 4-foot rise in sea levels as the melting rate accelerates in the Amundsen Sea sector. These predictions are the result of 40 years of observations in the area, which might explain the difference between the University of Washington results and the NASA results. In any case, both studies came to similar conclusions. ""We conclude that the disappearance of ice is unstoppable,"" said NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot during a teleconference today, and ""these changes are related in part to climate warming."" Sridhar Anandakrishnan, a professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University who participated in the NASA study, added during the teleconference that ""the system has chain reactions in place that aren't going to stop."" He suggested that the only the glacier retreat could stop is if the glaciers suddenly ""had to climb uphill, but we have looked at that, and we are fairly confident that there is no such hill or mountain that could slow down this retreat."" Humans aren't entirely at fault The melting of the ice, researchers say, isn't taking place because of warm air, but because of warm water in the ocean's depths. Winds in the Antarctic are pulling the water to the surface and causing the ice to melt. This is why the researchers state that global warming is a contributing factor, but not the sole cause: natural, non-human induced changes in climate across the globe might also be at fault. ""The basic idea that we are in this kind of retreat and that it's unstoppable has been around since the 1970s,"" said cryosphere program NASA scientist Tom Wagner, ""but we're finally at this point where we can put all those observations together and say 'Wow, we are really in this state.'"" When asked if humans might be able to do something to stop the melt, however, the scientists sound bearish. ""If the system, and especially if the thermal ocean forcing, stays the same,"" Rignot said, ""the retreat will be unstoppable.""",0.28945847052417367,0.7105415294758264,0.7131669635306211,517,5.0502901353965184,290,6.0965517241379308,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But until now, researchers had largely focused on examining these effects in victims of abuse, not the bullies themselves. This may soon change, as a long-term study published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences was able to demonstrate that ""pure bullies,"" people who have never experienced bullying themselves, do in fact face a long-lasting health effect from abusing others. As it turns out, that effect is actually beneficial — even when compared to people who aren't involved in bullying at all. Bullying is protective for bullies ""Pure bullies had the lowest blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker for inflammation,"" says William Copeland, an epidemiologist at Duke University and co-author of the study. ""This is kind of a beneficial outcome,"" because CRP is a risk factor for a variety of health problems down the road, such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome, Copeland says. These findings therefore suggest that ""the bullying experience was protective for the bullies."" In the study, researchers tracked over 1,000 children living in western North Carolina over seven years. They interviewed these kids multiple times starting at age nine, and then returned to interview them again in their early 20s. During each interview the scientists took blood samples, and asked participants a number of questions, including if they had experienced bullying over the course of the last three months. This allowed researchers to see and analyze changes in CRP levels over time, starting even before the bullying occurred. ""victims more frail to begin with?"" ""Some people ask, ‘Well aren't the victims more frail to begin with?'"" Copeland says. ""But we know that that's not the reason for these results because we can really isolate these other things on later CRP levels and account for any sort of behavior problems before the children were bullies or victims."" The results, he says, are clear. ""We're still seeing these lower levels [in bullies]."" As expected, Copeland adds, the victims had the highest levels of CRP. Interestingly, however, people who were both bullies and victims as children did not experience a positive or negative inflammatory effect. ""They fell right in line with what folks were uninvolved in bullying have,"" Copeland says. This means that their experiences might be canceling each other out. That's especially surprising, Copeland says, because previous studies have found that ""bully-victims"" actually have the worst outcomes in terms of mental health. ""A dysregulation of our internal stress response system"" The researchers aren't sure what causes these changes in CRP levels, but previous studies have suggested that stressors such as bullying and childhood maltreatment might affect how the body responds to stress in the long run. ""There may be a dysregulation of our internal stress response system,"" Copeland says, ""such that because of the experiences of bullying, cortisol gets revved up too often and too early in childhood."" Cortisol is an anti-inflammatory stress hormone, and if it gets over-excited repeatedly and for long periods at a time, the body's stress-response system essentially ""burns out,"" leaving the body vulnerable to inflammation. But pure bullies, Copeland says, don't experience this kind of stress. In fact, they often experience increased social status. ""Obviously this doesn't mean that we are encouraging kids to go out and bully others,"" Copeland says. ""There are many other ways to achieve that besides wreaking this havoc on other people, like athletics, clubs, social activities."" less stress, increased social status The researchers caution, however, that high CRP levels don't necessarily mean that a person is in poor health. Rather, the marker is ""a nice index of future health risk in people who are in their 20s and 30s."" Andrea Danese, a developmental psychobiologist at King's College London who did not participate in the study, said in an email to The Verge that ""this new study is a helpful addition to the literature in showing that these effects extend to another important childhood stressor, namely bullying."" Danese is part of a team of researchers who found similar effects in adults who experienced childhood maltreatment and social isolation at a young age. But Danese was unsure about how to interpret the results regarding the protective effects of bullying others. ""The results about the protective effects of being a pure bully are less clear,"" he said, and ""less supported by collateral information."" Copeland and his team are, for now, focused on analyzing the rest of the data they collected. They also plan to keep studying the study's participants, to find out more about the how these increased CRP levels might translate into serious health problems later in life. ""It can't be overemphasized,"" he says, ""how extraordinary it is to see these effects so long down the road.""",0.6186929005808216,0.3813070994191784,0.861375860579327,817,5.3157894736842106,419,6.3603818615751786,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But there’s one web comic that’s figured out how to create a viable business with a relatively small number of readers. Oh Joy Sex Toy, a weekly comic devoted to sex education and reviews of sex toys and porn sites, doesn’t have the mass appeal of its more innocent peers (sex may sell, but sex education doesn’t always garner the same rabid following as porn). Yet two years into the project, creators Erika Moen and Matthew Nolan are making enough to devote themselves full-time to the project — in spite of the fact that OJST brings in under 250,000 visitors per month (which, by Nolan’s estimation, is maybe a sixth of what fellow full-time web comic Girls With Slingshots brings in; and a minute fraction of the traffic seen by Penny Arcade). It doesn’t have the mass appeal of its more innocent peers. As Nolan outlined in a blog post earlier this year, the financial stability of OJST isn’t the product of one single magic bullet, but rather a combination of income streams — some traditional, some more innovative —that join together to create a viable business. Some of these revenue sources are common  in the world of web comics. Patreon — the popular platform that allows ""patrons"" to pledge a monthly amount to support a creator — comprises a large chunk of the site’s income; Moen and Nolan have also made repeated use of Kickstarter to raise the capital to publish print collections of their comics, and banner ads and sales of OJST books bring in income as well. But paired with these revenue streams is another highly lucrative form of income that’s much more novel, at least in the world of web comics: affiliate links, a commission system that provides users with a percentage of every sale that results from traffic they drive to a retailer. ""We make anywhere from $1,000-3,000 in sex toy affiliation sales a month,"" says Nolan. ""It swings wildly each month depending on what we review and the time of the year. Sometimes it actually makes more than Patreon.""   Creating a series of sex education comics has long been a dream for the Portland, OR, based couple. ""When I met Matt in 2005 I had recently done this short comic called GirlFuck, a 17-page basic intro for how cisgender lesbian sex works. It was proto-OJST; factual information paired with silly humor and graphic depictions of sex. I think basically from our first meeting he was telling me, ‘Hey, that comic you did, that was really good. You need to do more sex education comics like that!’ No exaggeration, he kept repeating that to me for the next eight years, and for eight years I was like, ‘Yeah, yeah, I'll do it someday.’"" During those eight years, Moen kept busy working as a freelance artist, honing her comics skills with Bucko, a murder mystery comic co-created with Jeff Parker, and diary comic DAR; while Nolan was employed as a game artist, consultant, and UX designer. But once Bucko wrapped, Moen finally felt ready to get started on a sex education project — only to find that the heavily researched, highly educational graphic novel she’d envisioned was much more taxing than she’d ever dreamed. ""I worked on it every day until I completely burned myself out — and that was just at the script stage... It felt too big, too important, and I didn't feel qualified to be doing it. I never studied sex or even sociology in college... Who was I to write a book on this subject?"" ""I worked on it every day until I completely burned myself out."" But fate intervened: an appearance on reality show StripSearch led to a conversation with Penny Arcade business manager Robert Khoo, who inspired Moen to go back to her web comic roots and start writing a weekly series. To pad out the site’s content and stave off burnout, she started running  sex toy reviews. But once Moen and Nolan realized how much money those reviews could bring in, they moved from being a secondary form of content to part of the site’s primary strategy. OJST now partners with a number of different affiliate programs, including Amazon (which offers the lowest commission, at 7-8 percent), sex toy shops like Babeland and Good Vibrations (which tend to offer a 15-20 percent commission), and a variety of porn sites (which, with a 50 percent commission, offer the highest split for the site). According to Nolan, ""Affiliate sales was a happy coincidence for us. We didn't set out to make a sex toy selling machine... People wanted to buy what we were talking about. So we gave them more places to buy them, and now affiliation and toy reviews are serious things we think and plan for."" Though Nolan acknowledges that the review-based nature of OJST makes affiliate links a more natural fit for the site than it might be for more narrative-based projects, he thinks the biggest barrier to entry is simply a lack of awareness. ""Comic folk just don't know you can make a percentage on sales you send people. It’s a hard idea to wrap your head around when you’re just used to selling your books.""   These days, the comic — which updates on a weekly basis — is roughly 50 percent reviews and 50 percent education, with occasional guest strips thrown in to mix things up and give Moen a bit of time off. Recent reviews have included examinations of the Tenga Original Vaccuum Cup and gay porn site CockyBoys; with educational comics including a primer on UTIs (which Moen enlivens with an embarrassing tale of pants wetting) and an interview with sexologist Emily Nagoski, author of the recently released Come as You Are. No matter the topic, each comic is introduced and hosted by an illustrated version of Moen or Nolan (or, on occasion, both) with a diverse group of ""Masturbateers"" on hand to help illustrate the finer points of sex toy usage and erotic anatomy. OJST wasn’t originally intended to be a full-time gig for both Moen and Nolan, but as the site’s revenue increased, that started to seem like a real possibility. When Nolan got laid off from his previous gig, he originally planned to look for a new day job. But a few months into his search, the couple realized they were making enough to cover expenses, allowing him to stop looking for work and focus his energies on building their business. According to Nolan, ""It’s not as much money as we could be bringing in if I had my old job, but at the same time we're much happier, and I’m not over worked."" It wasn’t intended to be a full-time gig for both Moen and Nolan, but that started to seem like a real possibility Even with two people on board, the project is still a great deal of work: scripting, drawing, and inking the comic takes the bulk of Moen’s time; leaving Nolan to handle most of the business. Though they've been able to expand beyond the web comic — a Kickstarter to fund volume two of the OJST book went live earlier this month — for now, Nolan and Moen aren't planning on launching any new sites or trying their hand at any Penny Arcade-style empires. And they do their best to remember that their success might not last forever. ""I don't want it to sound like we're rolling in the cash,"" says Nolan. ""As with any business, the majority of our income goes back into the comic… Are we making enough for the two of us to be working on this full-time? We're still trying to figure that out… How many sex toys can we really sell to our fans?"" Only time will tell — but if OJST continues to accrue more fans, it may turn out to be a surprisingly high number.",0.6077945601579878,0.39220543984201217,0.5128683389126206,1369,4.6435354273192111,675,5.8637037037037034,0,4,"Culture, Report",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

While the company reported smaller profits and revenue of $9.6 billion and $52.7 billion for the full year — compared to $11 billion and $53.3 billion, respectively, in 2012 — the company actually saw its PC revenue increase two percent, to $8.6 billion, since last quarter.

Along with SocialCam, an app it closely resembled, Viddy's rise was fueled by a tight integration with Facebook that caused its videos to appear prominently throughout the social network. But Facebook began limiting the apps' access to the News Feed, and their hockey-stick growth soon collapsed. SocialCam quickly sold itself to AutoDesk for $60 million, but Viddy persevered. Last fall after becoming Supernova, the company released apps for slow-motion video sharing and group chat.

It's a separate part of LinkedIn's website where nonprofits can post new opportunities, and it also aggregates postings from websites like Catchafire, Taproot Foundation, BoardSource, and VolunteerMatch. Not only does this expand on the LinkedIn Board Connect, a feature that came out in 2012 to help nonprofit leaders find professionals to join their boards, but it's a way for LinkedIn to kill two birds with one stone: get more nonprofits and potential volunteers to use the site, and increase traffic.  LinkedIn wants to be more than just your resume updater LinkedIn has become a professional standard, but unless you're actively looking for a job or looking for someone to fill a position, you probably don't spend much time on the site day to day. The company wants to users to think of LinkedIn as more than just the place you need to go in order to update your resume, and it's hoping the Volunteer Marketplace will be enough incentive to start that. LinkedIn is hoping to reach more students, who often need volunteer opportunities to boost their resumes, as well as professionals that may not be able to find a job because of the bleak economy.

Today Nintendo has finally revised that estimate, now forecasting an operating loss of ¥35 billion ($336 million) and net loss of ¥25 billion ($240 million), in what can only be seen as a huge backtrack for the Kyoto video game giant.  Profit and sales estimates always looked optimistic Nintendo also now expects to sell just 2.8 million Wii U consoles this financial year, down from an estimated total of 9 million — a drop of 69 percent. While the company will no doubt have received a sales boost to some degree during the holiday shopping season, it managed to sell just 0.46 million Wii U systems in the first half of the year, so the 9 million figure has been dubious for a while. Nintendo admits that it failed to sell as much software as it had hoped for over the holiday season due to the fact that ""hardware sales did not reach their expected level."" The profit and sales estimates always looked optimistic in the extreme, so the revisions won't come as a surprise to many. Whether it will jolt the famously conservative company into changing its strategy, however, remains far less predictable. Update: Iwata has issued a statement offering further explanation for the revised forecasts. ""Wii U sales, on the other hand, showed some progress in the year-end sales season as we released various compelling titles from the summer onwards, launched hardware bundles at affordable price points and also performed a markdown of the hardware in the U.S. and European markets; however, they fell short of our targeted recovery by a large margin. In particular, sales in the U.S. and European markets in which we entered the year-end sales season with a hardware markdown were significantly lower than our original forecasts, with both hardware and software sales experiencing a huge gap from their targets. In addition, we did not assume at the beginning of the fiscal year that we would perform a markdown for the Wii U hardware in the U.S. and European markets. This was also one of the reasons for lower sales and profit estimates.""",0.35824502408827497,0.641754975911725,0.4712161901178013,389,4.8406169665809768,219,5.7123287671232879,0,0,"Business, Gaming, Breaking",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Joining the horde of wearable tech purveyors at CES, the Japanese company debuted the $199 Watch and $129 Band, and — in another break with tradition — directed anyone interested in pre-ordering them to a new web service called Prelaunch. The brainchild of former Fossil Tech VP Donald Brewer, Prelaunch wants to apply the winning formula that’s made Kickstarter such a success to the pre-order process employed by established brands. The popularity of Kickstarter and other crowdfunding websites is built on a sense of authentic human interaction between the buyer and seller. While its core function is to facilitate commercial transactions, Kickstarter dresses that activity up in a language of ""backers"" and ""pledges"" and enhances it with intimate information about each project and personalized incentives for larger contributions. Backers spend money on both the project itself and on the experience of funding it. The unpredictability of whether a proposed product will get funded is part of the overall appeal. Contrast that with the typical pre-order page from a big company — clinical and impersonal, substituting tanned models for real users — and you begin to see the chasm of difference between the way people enjoy spending their money online and the way most brands expect them to. That’s the space Brewer’s Prelaunch wants to occupy. At the moment, says the Prelaunch CEO, ""Companies tend to have two separate streams: one is the store where transactions are handled, the other is the Facebook page where they actually socialize."" His idea is to meld the two, turning the landing page for a new product into an informative and interactive early adopter experience. Buying something from Prelaunch will get you access to production milestones, behind-the-scenes insights, and sometimes even the opportunity to test out gadgets ahead of release. If that all sounds terribly ambitious, that’s because it is. Donald Brewer has a storied résumé, having developed Microsoft’s SPOT smartwatch and founded the Phosphor E Ink watch brand, but his name recognition alone won’t be enough to attract companies to join Prelaunch. As if to illustrate the point, his first and biggest client, Epson, is a firm he’s already worked and consulted for in years past — how does Prelaunch hope to get the rest of the tech industry on board? For a company like Epson, whose biggest challenge is to swap its unexciting image for a more personable one, outsourcing the pre-order process to Prelaunch is a calculated risk. It eats into the company’s eventual proceeds, but it also gives it a chance to redefine its brand and identity in consumers’ minds. Assuming Prelaunch takes off, one of its additional strengths would be its centrality and ability to act as a hub for discovering cool new tech products coming up for release.   You’re certainly more likely to find and consider buying the Pulsense Watch at a gadget compendium like Prelaunch than you would be while browsing Epson’s projector portfolio. Brewer hopes to amplify this effect through a series of partnerships with hardware discussion forums as well as the creation of a forum on the Prelaunch site itself. To that end, he’s working with AVS Forum founder David Bott to build out the networking side of the business. Added product exposure and the humanizing effect of speaking directly to consumers are the two big selling points that Prelaunch has for electronics makers looking to sell their gear online. Of course, the big players like Sony and Samsung are capable of recreating those beneficial effects themselves, but smaller outfits like Scosche, AfterShockz, and Cogito stand to gain from uniting around a central gadget pre-sale hub. Prelaunch counts them among its early participants and will charge each of them between 15 and 20 percent of the final transaction price for any sales they make through the website. As part of the service, Prelaunch will also provide them with detailed analytics, A/B testing to perfect the right marketing message, and even order fulfilment should they lack the infrastructure to process orders themselves. While still in beta today, Prelaunch presents an intriguing model for the multitude of small tech companies occupying the space between homebrewed amateur productions and CES-headlining juggernauts. Some of them, like Modular Robotics, already set up shop on Kickstarter in spite of not needing the funding to ship their product — they’re there purely to collect pre-orders and generate buzz. Whether you believe Donald Brewer when he says he can fill that void or not, the business need is evidently there. As for consumers, Prelaunch aspires to give them another avenue for sating their appetite for early access to the latest gadgets, while also making the producers more relatable. Much like a Kickstarter project itself, Prelaunch appears more hopeful than pragmatic, but if it finds enough support, perhaps it too could surprise and move into the mainstream.",0.8916056948766424,0.10839430512335757,0.25291006257177595,841,5.2497027348394765,488,6.4241803278688527,0,0,"Business, Web, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

But starting this month, Google and any other ambitious automakers need to get permits from state of California to unleash self-driving vehicles on public roads. Last week, the state Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) handed out its first 29 permits for testing autonomous cars. Google won 25 of the 29 total permits, which will allow the company to test 25 modified, self-driving Lexus SUVs, according The Guardian. Meanwhile, Audi and Daimler AG-Mercedes Benz also received two permits each to test their own modified, self-driving cars. The permits are the result of a law California passed back in 2012 officially specifically authorizing autonomous vehicle tests, which came after similar laws were passed in Florida and Nevada. Though not illegal before, there weren't any specific regulations in California governing how self-driving cars should be treated differently from cars with human drivers. Now any qualified organization can apply for self-driving car permits: they cost $150 for the first car and $50 for every additional car, and require companies testing them to cover insurance costs up to $5 million. The permits are designed to help legitimize and regulate the burgeoning technology, while making sure that California remains at the forefront of its research and development. Small wonder the California DMV trumpeted the news. ""Autonomous vehicles are the future of transportation. The potential safety and mobility benefits are enormous,"" said Jean Shiomoto, director of the California DMV in a statement. ""Testing on public roads is one step to developing this technology, and the DMV is excited in facilitating the advancement of autonomous vehicles in California."" Correction: this story originally stated that Google only conducted self-driving car tests on closed courses or select areas. The company actually was able to conduct tests anywhere in the state. The story has since been updated to reflect this.

Last night Apple made a huge privacy-focused publicity blitz, led by a letter to the public written by CEO Tim Cook. The message was clear: Apple cares about keeping your data secure. But there's something a bit confusing about Apple's now very public privacy push. On a page explaining Apple's handling of government information requests, the company says this: On devices running iOS 8, your personal data such as photos, messages (including attachments), email, contacts, call history, iTunes content, notes, and reminders is placed under the protection of your passcode. Unlike our competitors, Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data. So it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8. That paragraph, which outlines a new hardline stance, sounds comforting for customers. But it also flies in the face of this landing page at Apple's website, still live as of today, directed at law enforcement. Here, Apple very clearly states that it can bypass the passcode in iOS to retrieve at least some of the data stored on your device — so long as the iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch is delivered to its Cupertino headquarters first. ""Upon receipt of a valid search warrant, Apple can extract certain categories of active data from passcode locked iOS devices,"" Apple said in May. ""Please note the only categories of user generated active files that can be provided to law enforcement, pursuant to a valid search warrant, are: SMS, photos, videos, contacts, audio recording, and call history."" The entire relevant section is included below.   Can Apple break through your passcode or not? That's still plenty of content for authorities to dig through. But has everything changed with iOS 8? This document on iOS 8 security measures suggests that's the case, showing that Apple has extended deep encryption protections to more of its own apps. ""Key system apps, such as Messages, Mail, Calendar, Contacts, and Photos use Data Protection by default, and third-party apps installed on iOS 7 or later receive this protection automatically,"" it reads. Either way, Apple taking a stand doesn't guarantee unbreakable privacy; authorities can still request call logs and your non-iMessage SMS history from carriers like Verizon and AT&T through search warrants and secret government requests you'd never even know about. And Wired reports forensics tools can still break through under certain circumstances. But if Apple has indeed removed every iOS backdoor and now steadfastly refuses to assist law enforcement, the two sides will inevitably clash. And the government would potentially have a compelling case based on one law: the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. Signed under President Bill Clinton, the legislation says that anyone building telecom equipment needs to design it to ""have built-in surveillance capabilities, allowing federal agencies to monitor all telephone, broadband internet, and VoIP traffic."" It's controversial whether the law would apply to Apple's data, but if the company shuts out the feds entirely, as it claims to have done, it could be setting the stage for a major legal challenge under CALEA and similar laws. We've reached out to the company in hopes of getting a definitive answer. Apple is clearly trying to be more transparent and open about privacy right now than at any point in its history, which is obviously a commendable mission. But a consistent message is critical to that effort, so hopefully the company will clear things up or update the law enforcement page in short order.

Apple's ""warrant canary"" is missing In its first transparency report, where it documents legal requests, Apple included this footnote: ""Apple has never received an order under Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act. We would expect to challenge such an order if served on us."" Many believed this to be a canary — a line that would disappear if and when Apple received a Patriot Act order, silently (and, although it hasn't been tested in court, perhaps legally) informing close readers. As flagged by GigaOm, Apple's last two transparency reports, which include the last half of 2013 and first half of 2014, dropped the canary — or at least changed the language in it — suggesting the company may have been ordered to hand over records under the Patriot Act. Now the report only reads this: ""To date, Apple has not received any orders for bulk data."" Several tech companies recently fought for the right to begin disclosing national security requests, but won only the option to disclose them in certain numbers. If less than 1,000 requests have been sent, for example, the company may only disclose that the number of requests was between zero and 999. Hence the need for the canary: Apple reports in ""bands"" of 250, and the ""zero to 250"" number didn't change between transparency reports, suggesting the company may have received at least one. Meanwhile, other companies are in a similar spot: Facebook reports ""zero to 999"" national security requests, as does Google. Update: As pointed out on Twitter, although the language has changed to not specifically mention the Patriot Act, Apple still includes one line in their report: ""To date, Apple has not received any orders for bulk data.""

The three-year development was complicated by changing specifications, and the government's convoluted procurement process meant entrenched companies were getting contracts over and over. But a wave of government accountability reports, concluded after months of investigations, is bringing new attention to the meltdown. The Government Office of Accountability released a report earlier this week detailing the security flaws in the site, but a report from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released yesterday is even more damning. Titled, ""Behind the Curtain of the HealthCare.gov Rollout,"" the report fingers the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversaw the development of the site, and its parent Department of Health and Human Services. ""...refused to admit to the public that the website was not on track"" ""Officials at CMS and HHS refused to admit to the public that the website was not on track to launch without significant functionality problems and substantial security risks,"" the report says. ""There is also evidence that the Administration, to this day, is continuing its efforts to shield ongoing problems with the website from public view."" The worst look comes from the internal emails excerpted in the report (including one that from CMS chief Marilynn Tavenner that begins ""Please delete this email."") Not many officials lost their jobs in the wake of the Healthcare.gov debacle — CMS CIO Tony Trenkle's resignation was one of the only staff changes immediately following the launch — but this report may change that. Things look especially bleak for Tavenner, who signed the approval saying the site could go live and also reportedly told her subordinates to delete emails in addition to deleting her own, a violation of federal record-keeping rules. Here's the worst of the batch. Blockquotes are directly from the report; the rest is paraphrased.   CMS refused to share information with HHS officials they felt were not adequately invested  in the development of Healthcare.gov. When HHS’s Frank Baitman asked CMS’s Henry  Chao for more visibility into the project, Mr. Chao wrote: ""If you can’t recognize a  burning house and its implications, what good is it to have a bunch of firemen tell you  there’s a burning house if you’re not going to do anything about it.""   CMS official Teresa Fryer acknowledged that that other CMS officials did not properly  convey the true state of security testing leading up to the launch: ""Kevin Charest [HHS  CISO] has asked for an update of the FFM testing by noon tomorrow and I’m going to  give him a truthful update of exactly what is going on. I am tired of the cover ups.""   After the launch, HHS officials sharply criticized CMS’s management leading up to the  launch of Healthcare.gov. Referencing an email in which a CMS official admits the system  could not handle more than 500 concurrent users, [HHS CIO Frank] Baitman wrote ""Frankly, it’s worse  than I imagined!"" and [HHS CTO Bryan] Sivak replied, ""Anyone who has any software experience at  all would read that and immediately ask what the fuck you were thinking by  launching.""

While sneaking around undetected can be thrilling, being spotted isn't, and these games have to walk a fine line between challenge and frustration. Make it too hard, and it’s just no fun. Few games have done it well, but that hasn't stopped Klei Entertainment from trying and succeeding — twice. The studio released Mark of the Ninja in 2012, a game that really made it feel like you were a ninja silently stalking your prey. And this week the Vancouver studio is releasing Invisible, Inc., a game where you play as a retrofuturistic spy, infiltrating government buildings and getting out with lots of secrets. Both manage to make stealth actually fun, and they do it in completely different ways.  What makes Invisible, Inc. so unique is its turn-based gameplay, which makes it feel sort of like a classic PC strategy game; you even view the world through an old-school, isometric perspective. Think of it as X-Com meets Metal Gear Solid, set in a world that mashes up cyberpunk and 1950s spy thrillers. You control a team of agents, and you have five days to take on a series of missions that involve infiltrating a building, gathering data and secrets, and then getting out alive. For each turn, your agents have a limited number of actions they can take, like moving into a different room or hacking a computer, and once you finish them up it's the guards' turn. This repeats until you’re either captured or you complete the mission. This structure works for stealth for a few reasons. For one thing, it really feels like you're dropped into the unknown and forced to figure out things for yourself, just like a spy. Each building is randomly generated, so you'll never experience the same one twice. And until you start moving, the entire level is blacked out (with the exception of your immediate surroundings). In order to figure out where things are — like whatever it is you're trying to steal, or the exit — you'll need to explore. You can peek through doors and look around corners, but you have to do it cautiously, otherwise you'll probably be spotted by a guard or security camera. But you also can't go too slow: with each turn the security level rises a little bit, adding more guards and additional security measures. It’s an interesting tension that makes every decision seem important. The thing is, when you do get caught, it can actually be fun. Because the game is turn-based, you have time to act after you're spotted; it’s not simply game over. When a guard sees you, they'll be alerted to your presence, but they won't actually shoot you until the next turn. This creates hope: if you play your cards right, you'll still be able to get away. You might be able to quickly sneak out of the guards’ field of vision, or slip in behind to knock them out. Instead of being frustrating, being spotted becomes a thrill. At one point in the game I found one of my agents, who had just rifled through a safe to find some important documents, surrounded by three guards, each of which had been alerted to her presence. Yet somehow, after a few close calls, I managed to get out and quickly make my way to the exit. These moments are my favorite parts of Invisible, Inc. Despite the fact that Klei has already made two excellent stealth games, this isn't a studio that's known for doing just one thing. In fact, aside from one sequel — 2012’s Shank 2 — all of the developer's games have been startlingly different. Shank was a brutally violent 2D brawler, while Mark of the Ninja was a side-scrolling assassination game. Don't Starve, meanwhile, was exactly what it sounds like: a survival game about enduring the harshness of an often inscrutable wilderness. With its isometric, cyberpunk styling, Invisible, Inc. is yet another completely new turn for the studio. ""We don't know what the hell we're doing,"" Klei founder Jamie Cheng says, when asked how the studio comes up with new ideas. ""We're playing around, and then whenever we find something interesting we jump fully on board."" This makes it hard to say exactly what it is that makes a Klei game a Klei game. ""Some people have said that they can tell,"" says Cheng, laughing. ""I'm actually not sure how they can tell."" But if there's one defining characteristic, it's that the studio's games seem to really focus in on one idea and get rid of anything that doesn't fit. In Don't Starve, you're mysteriously transported to a terrifying forest filled with demons and other oddities, and when you first start playing, everything feels alien and unfamiliar. You need food to eat and resources for crafting useful items, but figuring out how to make things is super hard. And one wrong mistake can mean the end; the game features permanent death, so when you die, it's game over. Even the art style, with its rough, squiggly characters, lends to the dark, Tim Burton vibe of the game. Similarly, Invisible, Inc. is all about one core idea. ""Invisible, Inc. was, to me, this thing where we could really explore what a real spy does, what a real stealth game is like,"" says Cheng. ""Which is, you actually don't know what's around the corner. It's just this space we felt wasn't really explored."" The procedurally generated levels help create this sense of the unknown, while the turn-based action gives you a small sense of control, much like what a secret agent would have. The setting, meanwhile, came later, so that the studio could add in all kinds of cool gadgets for you to play around with. And the wonderful art style just adds to the feeling that you’re a slick secret agent. The concept went through plenty of revisions — some of the original prototypes included a multiplayer-only version and a card-based mobile game — but anything that didn't fit with the core theme was eventually cut. The game has been available as an early access title on Steam since last year, but this week the final version is available on Windows and Mac (a PS4 version is also coming at some point in the future). It's one of my favorite strategy games in a long time. Every element just feels exceptionally polished and refined, from the character designs to the menus to the core gameplay. And it makes me excited about what the studio will do next — not because I want another Invisible, Inc., but because I want to see what other cool, new ideas Klei will come up with. ""We try to do something different every time,"" says Cheng.",0.4925554756624264,0.5074445243375736,0.16867105294194465,1137,4.7018469656992083,571,5.8406304728546408,0,9,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I know, it’s like I broke the law or something. But hey, I watched a lot of Glee in college, so — maybe a little arrogantly — I felt prepared enough to dive right into the first movie and watch a diverse assortment of young adults sing and dance their hearts out before making it to Regionals or whatever. While certainly not a wholesale ripoff, fans of the original know that that’s pretty much what happens. Anna Kendrick, as the drily rebellious Beca, joins a motley crew of disgraced college a capella singers and eventually leads them to glory. It ain’t perfect, but it’s fun — the kind of teen movie that wears its love of Top 40 pop and ‘80s underdog fantasies on its sleeve. Well, if Pitch Perfect was Glee at the movies, then you can liken Pitch Perfect 2 to Glee’s second season. It’s bigger, it’s louder, it’s stuffed to the brim with guest stars, and it’s really not as much fun. Pitch Perfect 2 is a lesson in why too much of a good thing can be bad. Pitch Perfect 2 picks up three years after the first movie. The Barden Bellas, at the top of their game as Barden University’s premier all-girl a capella group, is giving a special performance for Barack and Michelle Obama at Lincoln Center. Let’s just say a mishap occurs that effectively destroys the Bellas’ reputation, and once again the group is put on the road to redemption. It’s familiar territory; how will these misfits win it all when the deck is stacked against them? Obviously by winning an international a capella competition that no American has ever won before, that’s how! We’ve got the glee club equivalent of Rocky IV here! Of course, we all know that they will in the end, but the actual getting there is formula by now. It’s the defeat-defeat-harmony-victory cycle. But this time, with Elizabeth Banks in the director's chair, it's clear there's more money to play around with. Where once the Bellas faced off against fellow college nerds, now they grapple with singing German shock troops and the actual Green Bay Packers. Raising the stakes by raising the production values is a problem that beset Glee early on, too. No expense has been spared, from wardrobe to talent to the numerous set pieces, but it only serves to dress up the fact that, plot-wise, we’ve been there and done that. Some performances literally only happen because the movie needs a flashier way to have people sing at each other. At one point, the Bellas wind up at a secret, underground singing competition because David Cross, as a rich, eccentric a capella fan, loves inviting groups to his performance dungeon. It’s a bizarre bit of fan service for those who loved the Riff-Off in the original, but the whole conceit breaks down the more Banks throws at it. If you step even a toe outside of the film’s bubble of absurdity, you’ll find yourself asking: What am I really getting out of Packers linebacker Clay Matthews singing ""Bootylicious""? Why is he in this movie? The film makes a vague attempt to treat its central characters like human beings, mostly by focusing on what comes next for them in a post-Bellas world. Since most of the Bellas are college seniors, they’ll all have to face the real world eventually. Beca, already on her way to becoming a music producer, starts an internship at a studio headed up by Keegan-Michael Key. Key, as a no-nonsense, high-maintenance producer, is about as real as the film gets, and he’s a hilarious breath of fresh air. It’s Key's character, in fact, who asks Beca to stop focusing on a capella and start making original music. Chloe (Brittany Snow) is stuck in a rut, having held herself back in college for three extra years to stay with her beloved Bellas. Meanwhile, scene stealer Bumper (Workoholics’ Adam DeVine) is trapped at Barden as a security guard after a failed shot at the sort-of big time. The movie doesn’t let the characters dwell on the future for too long, though. There’s always a show-stopping number to perform or montage to muck through. But all that spectacle doesn’t hide what doesn’t work. Pitch Perfect 2 just isn’t very good at pretending it’s anything more than fan service, and it’s often not great at even that. The sets are bigger, but the writing is lazier, with plenty of confusing moments that can even get downright racist. For instance, Chrissie Fit, who plays new Bella Florencia Fuentes, is turned into one long, terrible joke about about the plight of murdered women in Latin America, a problem her fellow Bellas just sort of nod at. Elsewhere, Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins return as Talk-apella judges and double down on their over-the-top banter, trading barbs about Jews and the fact that no one cares about Koreans. But really, Pitch Perfect 2 is bad because it’s trying too hard to please. It’s like the first movie, shocked it became a sleeper hit, basically went, ""Holy shit, that worked? Give them more!"" It’s the kid in chorus who got a standing ovation last year, and decided to pile on the sequins to make a bigger splash at this year’s big performance, all without actually improving on her voice. Pitch Perfect was always absurd, and it reveled in it. Its sequel packs in even more pop hits, outrageous moments, and big finishes in its nearly two-hour runtime, all at the expense of good comedy. In going big, the movie forgot how to be funny. I walked out of the theater thinking maybe campy singing underdog movies aren’t really meant for long-running series. I remember checking out on Glee halfway into the third season, tuning in every now and then but coming away disappointed. It lost its magic, and it feels like Pitch Perfect is losing it, too. Which makes me sad for the promised Pitch Perfect 3.

The event is the annual culmination for Valve’s competitive online game Dota 2, attracting the sort of buzz and hype that's helped the game transcend its niche status and rise to the front page of The New York Times. This year’s TI, as it’s affectionately known, is expected to raise more than $15 million in prizes, which will comfortably eclipse even last year’s eye-popping $11 million prize pool. But if I were to show you an electrocardiogram with one massive spike in the middle and a series of irregular beats around it, you’d quickly declare the patient ill and advise urgent medical attention. That's the state of Dota 2. While TI shines like a beacon for everything good and glamorous about competitive gaming, it only lasts for a few halcyon days in the summer. Once its bright lights have been shut down and the massive Seattle venue has been emptied out, players are left to their own devices for the rest of the year. So yes, it’s like the Super Bowl, but without the NFL regular season, or perhaps it's more akin to the World Cup without the accompanying pro leagues. Outside of TI, Dota 2 professional play is a mess that leaves many people unhappy. This past week, I talked with two of the most prominent figures in the Dota community: David ""LD"" Gorman, a commentator from the Beyond The Summit studio, and Clement ""Puppey"" Ivanov, the captain of Team Secret. LD has become one of the signature voices of Dota 2, having served as the play-by-play announcer at multiple TI finals, while Puppey was part of the Na’Vi squad that won the inaugural International in 2011. They both love the game (and have benefited from it) as much as anyone can, but they also share deep concerns about the way it’s organized in the vast stretches of time between Internationals. Because Valve only takes responsibility for organizing TI, the rest of the yearly competitive schedule has to be cobbled together by grassroots efforts or, more commonly, sponsor-driven events. LD has been part of both. His studio runs The Summit, an intriguing mix of house party and LAN event, which raises its prize pool primarily through an in-game ticket that fans can purchase, though it also relies on the help of sponsors to cover its costs. Then there’s the Red Bull Battlegrounds event that was just completed this weekend, where LD was the lead commentator. That was run chiefly by Red Bull’s e-sports division, which is working on establishing itself as a major promoter of professional Dota 2 play.  The Red Bull event has been great, says LD, but it’s the exception to the rule. ""The vast majority of events do a pretty poor job of taking care of players,"" he laments, noting that some lack even the most basic facilities like a diversity of food and spare computers for training. There’s also ""not much advance notice or a show plan,"" which affects casters like him as much as it does the players. The typical modus operandi for tournament coverage is to ""fly over to the event, go in blind, and just hope the setup’s going to work."" Many prominent tech and lifestyle brands have wised up to the value of presenting their gear in front of a deeply engaged gaming audience, which has led to an abundance of sponsored tournaments happening throughout the year. At any one time, there’s some competition happening somewhere: all the way from the Alienware Cup in China to the Zotac Starleague in Brazil. This can be fun from a fan’s perspective, but it’s exasperating for the players because of how chaotic it all is. Puppey tells me that sometimes tournaments will pop up with less than a month’s notice, and echoes LD in saying that ""the human aspect is completely gone. I don’t want to earn money as much as I want to have a good time. And the good time is lost if I can’t have access to a bathroom."" As one of the more mature members of the Dota 2 pro scene, Puppey typically refrains from voicing his concerns publicly, but he’s frustrated that there’s no way to ""punish"" maltreatment when players encounter it. ""You can’t punish anything, if they lack computers for training, for example. There’s no entity behind the players that can punish poor tournament organizers."" Unlike Red Bull’s most recent effort, which LD is full of praise for, most events are done haphazardly and with little expertise — and what’s worse, the lessons learned by the people who organize the Eizo Cup, for example, are not transferred to those running the Gigabyte Challenge, because there’s no communication or coordination between them. Even when a tournament is run perfectly, the lack of a centralized Dota 2 competition schedule means that sometimes the top teams in the world will be competing in overlapping grand finals. This weekend, while Puppey and Secret were taking on China’s Invictus Gaming in San Francisco for the Battlegrounds crown, Vici Gaming and Team Empire were contesting the Dota 2 Champions League title over in Berlin. That may seem like a boon for fans until you realize that having all four teams competing in both contests might have made for an even more exciting time. Valve has held true to its laissez-faire principles, but, much as with Google’s experience with Android, it’s finally felt the need to rein in the fragmentation of its self-organizing competitive scene. In April, the company announced plans for a new series of Dota Major Championships, which are intended to establish a set of minimum standards for Dota 2 tournaments. They’ll add three more marquee tournaments, alongside The International, to the yearly list of Valve-endorsed events, and ""teams that participate in these events will be required to adhere to limited roster trade periods during the year."" Puppey likes the initiative already, saying it’s good to have an annual process, more rigorous structure, and a consistent calendar that gives people something to look forward to outside of TI. This intervention appears overdue, but its effect remains uncertain. LD worries that the Majors will be damaging to smaller-scale independent competitions, which will likely struggle to attract the top teams. Amid the chaos of the current scene, there’s still a strong feeling of connection between amateur and professional players, and some of that may be lost if the pros decide that only Majors will be worth their time. The tension between keeping the game and its players accessible and, at the same time, satisfying their requirements seems like a chronic issue that won’t be resolved any time soon. The one thing we’ll never see, according to LD, is Valve adopting a system like that of League of Legends, where Riot Games pays salaries to the players and runs a year-round schedule of LAN tournaments. ""Valve does not want to be the nanny,"" he says, ""they believe much more in the free market."" E-sports journalist Rod Breslau tells me that the League system has been hugely successful, as evidenced by the fact that ""LoL gets the most viewership — especially in the US and Canada — the most comments, the most fan interaction, etc."" and it has a much bigger army of players than Dota 2. But it’s just not the Valve way. Valve’s entire business philosophy is about being hands-off and unstructured, and the action it’s taking now is a very cagey effort to just even out the spikes in its ECG. Dota 2 won’t ever have the regular rhythm of League of Legends, and that’s pretty much by design. Dota 2 has grown into a unique online gaming phenomenon by turning a narcotically addictive five-on-five battle game into a lucrative spectator sport. The money earned during last year’s TI dwarfed anything else that e-sports had previously achieved, with the winning Team Newbee collecting a $5 million prize. Yes, League of Legends has a similar format and a lot more players, but it doesn’t have that crazy spike in its annual calendar of events that Dota has. Valve’s game is sick, in both the positive and negative senses of the word. Valve is also unmatched in the way it raises the funds fueling The International’s popular notoriety. Remember, Dota 2 is entirely free to play and compete in, and yet it’s somehow producing eight-figure prize funds. The key to this is fan engagement, as Valve sells a $10 Compendium of in-game loot and cosmetics to raise most of the prize pool for The International. In the beginning, Valve’s own contribution of $1.6 million made up the lion’s share of prizes, but its proportion of the total has shrunken dramatically as the number of Dota players and their willingness to support the game have increased. A quarter of the money spent on Compendiums goes directly into the TI prize fund, which for last year’s $11 million International meant Valve had to receive over $40 million in purchases of Compendiums and related loot. Valve’s ability to galvanize (or, to put it more bluntly, monetize) its user base is remarkable, and it’s at least partly down to the sense of ownership that the company bestows to its players by being as hands-off as it is. Dota 2 is a game beloved by many despite, and perhaps partially because, of its chaotic nature. Valve has acknowledged a responsibility to do more to ensure consistency for the game’s competitive scene, but it will have to strike a tricky balance between its present hands-off approach and the unfamiliar need for top-down regulation. In an ideal world, events like Red Bull Battlegrounds would be the norm rather than the exception, but as fantastic as Dota may be, it’s played in our flawed and messy universe — and that’s where Valve needs to step in and make things better.",0.5662190280913395,0.4337809719086605,0.1754457695134414,1666,4.8979591836734695,794,6.3501259445843825,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Since then, Eric Schmidt insisted that the program is far from dead and the CEO of Italian eyewear Luxxotica told the Wall Street Journal said a ""second version"" that incorporated the ""second thoughts"" Google had about the platform was coming ""soon."" Now, Droid Life has dug up a submission to the FCC that shows fairly compelling evidence that Google is actively testing the next version of Glass. These kinds FCC documents used to be a rich source for people looking to learn about what gadgets were coming soon, but in recent years both those companies and the FCC have learned to lock up actual product photos under confidentiality agreements. Nevertheless, there are still details to be found amongst the tests, which require companies to disclose whether or not the radios inside these gadgets are safe for use around humans. Thus, we know that the device with the FCC ID A4R-GG1 supports various Wi-Fi bands and Bluetooth. Glass is coming back But more interestingly, these documents also require that companies disclose where the FCC label will appear and what it will look like. And in this case, Google is taking advantage of the 2014 E-Label act, which lets companies bury those labels away in the settings instead of printing them on the device itself. So instead of speculating about the shape of the device based on the size and position of a sticker, we get to speculate on the software of the device. Here, the GG1's documentation also gives us details: it's going to appear on a particularly Glass-like rectangular display and it's available on a submenu that requires users to ""scroll left and right"" — the scrolling directions used on the last version of Glass. Does all that add up to solid proof that the GG1 is the next version of Glass and that it will be coming out in 2015? Let's say it adds up to a solid ""maybe,"" since FCC documents rarely provide anything that definitive. But it certainly seems like Google is intent on taking another swing at convincing consumers they will want a computer on their face.

It is supposedly based on a device that was originally announced at Mobile World Congress back in March, and back then the best image we had to go off of was a low-resolution snapshot of the device being held up on stage. Now, Evan Blass (aka @evleaks) has posted a high-resolution render of the device, codenamed Venice, to Twitter. It reveals the aforementioned display, curved at the sides like the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. There's a speaker at the bottom, and if you look closely at the last photo you can see that the basic design mostly matches up. It looks as though BlackBerry has chosen to excise dedicated Send and End keys — presumably because the device is now going to run Android instead of BlackBerry 10. It also seem possible that there's still a keyboard scurried away underneath that screen. The one other notable thing about Blass' image is that it has Google app icons strewn about — which should mean that it has full access to Google's suite of apps and services. Blass also claims that the Venice will be coming to AT&T. Last month, Reuters originally reported that BlackBerry would make the switch to Android. If this render proves accurate (and Blass has a long history of posting accurate leaks), it might well be coming soon. It's been a very long time since there's been a decent Android device with a physical keyboard and an even longer time since there's been a vertical sliding phone with a physical keyboard.

In one famous experiment, researchers place a bird in a cage equipped with sensors. When night falls, the bird jumps in the direction in which it would normally migrate, allowing researchers to determine where it would like to go. But in 2004, in a German lab at the University of Oldenburg, the classic experiment failed miserably. The European robins that the researchers were using simply wouldn't orient themselves in a single direction. ""We tried to change the food the birds were getting, the light, the cages — just about anything,"" recalls biologist Henrik Mouritsen. ""Nothing had any effect."" invisible lines of force disrupting bird migration For the next three years, Mouritsen and his team tried to figure out why the robins weren't orienting. Nothing they tried seemed to work, until one of the scientists made a suggestion: maybe they should block the electromagnetic noise emanating from the electronics on campus, just to see. That night, the researchers covered the cages with aluminum screens and, against all odds, the birds started jumping again. This was the moment that the researchers realized what no one had ever considered: the invisible lines of force that electronics constantly emit around us were actually disrupting the orientation capabilities of small migratory songbirds. ""We are absolutely sure that the effect is real,"" Mouritsen says. And the intensities that are affecting the birds are ""1,000 times below the World Health Organization guidelines."" Today, the researcher speaks with authority, but back in 2007, Mouritsen was more than a little skeptical. ""My immediate reaction was that this is highly unlikely to be the reason."" So the scientists did a number of follow-up experiments — six years' worth — to confirm the results that were finally published today in the journal Nature. Unfortunately, these experiments didn't determine which electronics are to blame. The disruption, Mouritsen says, could come from ""basically anything you put into a plug."" But the effect is only present in large urban or industrial areas, and around university campuses — locations in which humans tend to use a large number of electronics at once. AM radio, not cell phone signals or power lines The researchers did figure out that the interference doesn't come from cellphone signals or power lines, however, because their frequencies are too high and too low, respectively. Instead, the frequency band that seems to be at play is the 2 kHz-5 MHz range, which ""originates primarily from AM radio signals and from electronic equipment running in university buildings, businesses, and private houses,"" the researchers write in the study. Furthermore, Mouritsen explains, ""these disturbances are so small that a conventional physicist will tell you that they can't have any effect."" That's why he thinks the problem isn't one of conventional physics, but of quantum mechanics. ""Theoretical predictions suggest that [the disruption] might be an effect of electron spins."" Electromagnetic noise might be affecting electron spins in a molecule named cryptochrome, Mouritsen says — the eye protein that some scientists believe plays a pivotal role in avian magnetic orientation. This could cause the molecule's chemical properties to change, and the birds to lose all sense of direction at night. But the theory, Mouritsen warns, is ""unproven."" losing all sense of direction Nikita Chernetsov, a behavioral ecologist at the Russian Academy of Sciences who did not participate in the study, said in an email to The Verge that the findings are fascinating. ""It raises the question of whether other functions of migratory birds are affected by this kind of noise, which has been widely believed to be harmless."" For now, however, this is ""probably not a big deal,"" he said, because a migrating bird that has entered an urban area ""needs just to leave the city in any direction to regain [its migratory] ability."" This may be true, Mouritsen says, but humans should still consider limiting the level of electromagnetic noise present in cities and universities. ""A lot of equipment is sending unnecessarily high levels of electromagnetic radiation, and it may be possible to reduce it."" Yet, when asked if some birds might be avoiding cities as a result, Mouritsen replies that he doesn't know. ""It's an interesting thought that may be true,"" he says.

According to The Washington Post, those initiatives include both commercial and federal pledges — Walmart says it will double the number of on-site solar energy projects it has in its stores and distribution centers by 2020, while the Energy Department will issue two new rulings today to cut energy consumption in electric motors, walk-in refrigerators, and freezers.

A new study led from the Goethe University Frankfurt has found that by applying current in certain frequencies to a sleeper's scalp, just above the forehead, that person may be able to gain some control over their dreams. In particular, that control included allowing people, to some degree, to recognize that they were dreaming and to view the dream as if from a third-person perspective — traits that the researchers say qualify these as lucid dreams.  ""It was a bit like in an animated movie, like 'The Simpsons.'""The study, which was published Sunday in Nature Neuroscience, based its tests around earlier studies examining people who were natural lucid dreamers. Those studies had found that a certain electrical signal was stronger in the frontal and temporal parts of the brain during lucid dreams, and it's that signal that this new research set out to recreate to determine whether it was the cause of lucid dreams, a byproduct of it, or something unrelated. As it turned out, that electrical signal seems to be a cause of lucid dreams, potentially because it stimulates areas of the brain relating to higher-order consciousness. Only certain frequencies were able to properly stimulate the area though, particularly 40Hz, which resulted in over three-quarters of dreams being classified as lucid, and to a lesser extent 25Hz, which led to over half of dreams being qualified as lucid. In the tests, the current was only applied for a matter of seconds, a few minutes after a test subject entered the REM stage of sleep. The type of lucidity that appeared is basic for now, however, and doesn't necessarily involve the type of robust control over one's dreams that lucid dreaming is said to provide. One account from the study of a lucid dream at 40Hz illustrates their limitations: I was dreaming about lemon cake. It looked translucent, but then again, it didn’t. It was a bit like in an animated movie, like The Simpsons. And then I started falling and the scenery changed and I was talking to Matthias Schweighöfer [a German actor] and two foreign exchange students. And I was wondering about the actor and they told me “yes, you met him before,” so then I realized “oops, you are dreaming.” I mean, while I was dreaming! So strange! The study was also conducted on a small group of subjects, just 27, so the results are limited. Still, the researchers say that their results signal that stimulation at 40Hz is relevant to triggering consciousness in dreams — and potentially even while awake too. The researchers believe that this could eventually even be used as a clinical treatment, perhaps even helping treat schizophrenia by restoring dysfunctional pathways or treat post-traumatic stress disorder for those with nightmares by allowing them to change the content of their dreams.",0.43566196294995696,0.564338037050043,0.5123170231875802,484,5.0103305785123968,267,6.1498127340823974,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But scientists at the Scripps Research Institute have managed to add a single pair of artificial ""X"" and ""Y"" nucleotides to the genetic code of an E. Coli strain, reports The New York Times.

Finally, should the strain escape into the environment, it probably wouldn't survive for very long, Romesberg said, because it needs to feed on synthetic molecules to replicate — molecules that only the scientists can supply. This means that it could never infect other organisms in its current form, because it would most likely die.

A series of explosions at the power plant killed 31 workers and released cancer-causing radiation into the atmosphere — many times more than even the Fukushima disaster of 2011 — leading to widespread health and environmental problems that are still being accounted for. Villages surrounding the site have long been abandoned, the environment is poisoned, and officials are still working to clean up the site — a process that is expected to take decades. The completion of a gigantic protective arch will mark a major step toward that goal. When construction finishes, the 32,000-ton structure will completely seal off the radioactive debris of a nuclear reactor that exploded on that fateful night in 1986, allowing Ukraine to safely begin the decommissioning process. But the project has already seen several delays, and it carries a hefty $2 billion price tag. And as unrest continues to unfurl across Ukraine, hampering an already weak economy, there are fears that cleanup efforts may face further setbacks. ""It's complicated to begin with,"" says Sharon Squassoni, director of the Proliferation Prevention program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Then you add the possibility of political or military turmoil — it's going to make things even tougher."" ""Are we concerned about the situation? Of course we are concerned."" The Ukraine government commissioned the arch in 1992 to replace the existing ""sarcophagus"" shelter covering the destroyed Unit 4 reactor. The structure was hastily built as an emergency measure following the explosions at Chernobyl, and over time began showing signs of structural weakness. If it collapses, officials fear, it could release dangerous radioactive contaminants into the atmosphere. The arch is designed to put those fears to bed. Known as the New Safe Confinement, it will stand more than 350 feet high when completed — taller than the Statue of Liberty — covering the building where the reactor is stored. This will allow workers to begin dismantling Unit 4 and remove any nuclear waste — an even longer, and more difficult task. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which oversees financing for the project, says the confinement is built to last 100 years because that's how long the cleanup could take. The New Safe Confinement at Chernobyl (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development / Flickr) Even in a relatively stable Ukraine, it took two decades for construction to begin, and the project has since faced several delays due to both technical challenges and funding shortfalls. Completion was originally targeted for 2015, but has now been pushed back to 2017. Vince Novak, director of nuclear safety at the EBRD, says he's ""highly confident"" that the new target will be met, even amid Ukraine's turbulent political climate. He says the project has continued without interruption since unrest broke out, adding that companies and donor governments maintain ""full commitment,"" though he acknowledges some uncertainty. ""Are we concerned about the situation? Of course we are concerned, says Novak. ""It is unfortunately a situation which can further deteriorate and it's very difficult, then, to predict what the impacts on our project will be."" Ukraine's turmoil began late last year, when anti-government protests erupted over a decision to abandon an economic deal with the European Union and forge closer ties with Russia. The demonstrations led to the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych in February, following violent clashes with police, and Ukraine's interim government has struggled to maintain order in the country's eastern region, where pro-Russian insurgents are demanding greater political autonomy. ""The less money we have the less could be done."" Ukraine's acting minister of foreign affairs has warned that the country's nuclear facilities may be at risk in the event of war, but experts say Chernobyl — which hasn't produced power since 2000 — is an unlikely target. The site is located near Ukraine's northern border with Belarus, far removed from the chaos that swirls in the east, and it remains heavily guarded. Striking Chernobyl or any of Ukraine's 15 other nuclear reactors would also carry serious environmental ramifications for Russia — not to mention international condemnation — and Squassoni says the Russian forces are ""sophisticated enough"" to avoid them. According to a 2005 report from the International Atomic Energy Agency, Ukraine spends 5 to 7 percent of its budget every year on Chernobyl-related programs — including cleanup efforts, research, and care for affected civilians — and pays roughly the same percentage of all direct contributions to the confinement project. (Europe and the US are among the biggest donors, according to the EBRD, rounding out a group of about 40 countries, including Russia.) But Ukraine's limping economy has raised doubts about Chernobyl's funding going forward. The country faces huge debt and a growing budget deficit, and conditions have only worsened during this year's crisis. ""Any unrest affects a country's economy, and remediation is not a profitable activity,"" says Oleg Nasvit, a nuclear physicist at the National Institute for Strategic Studies in Kiev. ""To carry it out, we need funding from the state budget. The less money we have the less could be done."" ""This is going to be a challenge for years to come."" The International Monetary Fund has pledged $17 billion over the next two years to help keep Ukraine's economy afloat, and there are so far no signs that the country will reduce its Chernobyl-related spending. But Ukraine's burden will become greater once construction of the confinement is finished. At that point, the EBRD and its donor countries will step aside, and Ukraine will be responsible for decommissioning the site and removing all radioactive materials. ""All of that is incredibly expensive and time-consuming,"" Squassoni says. ""This is going to be a challenge for them for years to come. And if you're worried about your political survival I'd say chances are you're not going to put this very high on the list."" Yet Novak remains confident that Ukraine and other countries will continue to prioritize the cleanup efforts at Chernobyl, even as regional tensions continue to flare. Radiation levels across Europe spiked when the plant erupted in flames 28 years ago, underscoring the fact that Chernobyl is not Ukraine's problem alone. ""You must not forget that this is a project about nuclear safety,"" Novak says. ""And its importance transcends borders and transcends political divisions and differences.""",0.42803370021182124,0.5719662997881787,0.8749104218310165,1080,5.3648148148148147,571,6.4956217162872152,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted its approval to one of the projects that came from that effort: a mind-controlled prosthetic limb called the DEKA Arm. A number of other scientists and engineers around the world are working on similar devices, but this is the first such prosthetic to get FDA approval. The prosthetic device comes from a company founded by Segway inventor Dean Kamen, and it is roughly the size and weight of an adult arm. The arm is controlled by electromyogram electrodes placed on the remaining portion of the human arm. Those sensors pick up electric signals from muscle movements in the upper arm, and a computer in the robotic arm can tell what type of maneuver the user wants to make. The results are impressive: with the arm, amputees in clinical trials were able to perform tasks once thought impossible for a prosthetic limb. They could use zippers and keys, and — thanks to vibration feedback at the base of the prosthetic — they could pick up objects like grapes and eggs without crushing them. This 60 Minutes segment on the DEKA Arm from 2009 shows the prosthetic in action. The FDA is calling the DEKA Arm the first prosthetic arm controlled by electric signals that can accomplish multiple, robotically-powered movements at once. To get there, DARPA has invested some $40 million into the project, according to Bloomberg BusinessWeek, and that's just part of the agency's larger $100 million ""Revolutionizing Prosthetics"" program. Now that the arm has FDA approval, DEKA can seek out a manufacturer and eventually get the product out to amputees. As if the capabilities of the arm weren't enough, it seems the company already has a good marketing plan: employees affectionately call the arm ""Luke"" after the Star Wars hero who receives a perfect arm replacement in Empire Strikes Back.

In 2000, people 65 and over made up 12 percent of the population, and by 2030, that number is expected to climb to 19 percent. As a result, ""elderly monitoring"" products — products designed to help loved ones keep an eye on ailing parents such as GPS bracelets, motion sensors, and so-called ""granny cams"" -— have started popping up in online stores and specialized pharmacies all over the US. Unfortunately, most of these systems have huge drawbacks that would make anyone reticent to use them. GPS systems, for instance, can really only tell you a person's location, not how well they're doing. And cameras infringe on a person's privacy in a big way. That's why researchers have turned to technology that you're much more likely to see in an airport than in your aging parent's home: radar. It knows when you fall down Radar, scientists say, is ideal for those who wish to remain independent in their own homes, but still like access to the security that comes with knowing someone or something is checking up on them. ""The algorithm is smart enough to discriminate between two closely resembling activities — sitting and falling,"" says Moeness Amin, an engineering professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania who is working on developing the system. ""And once the radar declares that a person has fallen, it sends a signal to the mobile phones of family members and neighbors, as well as to first responders."" Designed primarily for people living alone, the system makes use of radar units that can fit in a hand. These units send out electromagnetic waves into the surrounding environment that return with modified frequencies when they hit an object or a person. ""Each limb in your body, your head and your torso, reflects a frequency that is different from that one that was sent,"" Amin says. ""And those changes are the markers that we can use to classify the type of motion."" Amin and his team of researchers can therefore tell the difference between a person who is sitting down and someone who has fallen down with a cane in hand. They can also use the technology to monitor a person's heart rate and breathing. Moreover, the use of radar technology means that whoever receives an alert will be able to tell where a fall or a cardiovascular event occurred in a person's home. But the system, which is still in the development phase, is specific to the user, so it won't be easy to set up. Different people have different habits and gaits, Amin explains, so the algorithm needs to be trained to recognized the way someone moves around. If an elderly person uses a walker, for instance, the system needs to be able to recognize the metal contraption in front of that person's legs. This learning phase is extremely important because you wouldn't want the radar to mistake the ""90-pound lab on the living room floor"" for the person it's supposed to monitor, explains Kelly Nestor, an adult nurse practitioner and clinical instructor also at Villanova University. teaching students how to fall like the elderly Nestor has been sharing her expertise with the researchers to ensure that the system is capable of understanding how the elderly interact with their environment. This means that she has spent a lot of time in the lab teaching college students how to walk and fall like the elderly. Right now, she says close to 50 percent of elderly Americans are choosing to remain in their own homes instead of moving to a nursing home as they age, ""so if we can do something to boost their safety, we will be in a much better place."" Unfortunately, training the radar to recognize how a certain person moves means that it won't work as well if they're doing something outside of their normal routine, such as entertaining guests. ""We will train the radar for how Joe walks, how Joe sits and how Joe falls,"" Amin says, ""so it will be very robust for Joe. But if I go and fall, then the false alarm rate won't be as small as it will be for Joe."" And false alarms, Amin says, are a big concern. ""Right now, we can get to one false alarm in 100, but that's using three units in the same room."" To counter imprecisions, Amin suggests that people turn off the radar systems when they entertain guests. And if someone lives with a partner, that household will need more radar units to resolve both of their movements. Youngwook Kim, a computer engineer at California State University at Fresno who did not participate in the project, told The Verge in an email that ""this radar system is valuable in that it can be an alternative solution when a camera system does not work in the dark to detect the falls."" But Kim also said that he believes the system ""should be improved"" before it hits the market because it will require ""a huge number of training databases"" in order to control the rate of false alarms. In addition, Kim says that although ""the idea itself is interesting, personally I am doubtful of how many elderly people will want to use this system"" — especially since it needs to be installed ""all over the place"" in someone's home. ""I am doubtful of how many elderly people will want to use this system."" As Kim pointed out, the need for multiple radar units won't make it an easy sell, because having to outfit a home with multiple units means that the service will be extremely expensive. Amin says that he expects to see each unit priced at ""less than $500,"" which means that covering an average-sized room will cost around $1,500. And the cost of the units themselves doesn't include the cost of the monitoring system that powers the units. So, in all likelihood, the service will resemble that of a house alarm. People will sign up and receive radar units at ""no charge,"" Nestor says, but the customer will get billed for the service every month. But the aspect that is most likely to halt the project's progress is public perception. ""The safety of the electromagnetic waves is not a concern,"" Amin says, ""but the psychological taboo of having a radar looking at you all the time will need to be worked out."" Nestor believes that the alternative — moving to a nursing home where they lose most, if not all, of their independence — will be enough to make people consider using the radar system. ""The number of Americans that are aging and who live alone, and own their own homes just continues to increase,"" she says, and ""a move is traumatic when you are that much older."" Furthermore, there's always a chance that someone might use the system to monitor someone that doesn't want to be watched. After all, government and security agencies ""have been doing that for the past 10 years,"" Amin jokes, so it can definitely be ""misused and abused."" But the researcher, who has represented academia at numerous NATO conferences, also thinks that if someone really wants to use radar to monitor another human being, they can already do so using the technologies that are readily available to the public. The system the researchers are developing, he says, is intended for very specific purposes. ""We are monitoring the elderly and specifically focusing on falls and on anomalies of cross-motor activities."" Liu Liang, a computer engineer at the University of Missouri who did not work on the project but has done work on radar monitoring systems for the elderly in the past, thinks Amin's system could truly help people because falls ""really cause fatal accidents"" among the elderly. According to a study of Canadians over 65, about 62 percent of  injury-related hospitalizations at that age are the result of a fall.  Moreover, 1 in 1,000 falls results in death. So if a technology can save people's lives and protect people's privacy, Liang says, ""I would recommend it to family and friends as we reach old age."" 1 in 1,000 falls results in death Amin and his team will perfect the system over the course of the next two and a half years, but they also plan on shopping around this fall for a company that can help them get the product to market. Unfortunately, even if it manages one day to improve the lives of the well-off retirees, it will be hard to tell because very few studies have actually investigated whether elderly monitoring systems have improved the quality of life of the people they monitor. In fact, when I asked Nestor if she knew of any studies that have demonstrated a tangible benefit to the people who have used these devices, Nestor seemed rather surprised.

Startup lending companies like LendUp and Moven check to see whether a potential borrower has posted about losing a job on Facebook, for example, as well as factor the number of friends a borrower has into their decision of whether or not to make a loan. The prospect of mining social media data is so appealing that now Fair Isaac Corp (FICO), the company that calculates consumers' credit scores, is thinking about getting into the game. Social media is used to get more information on borrowers, but some innovative startups have also started using it to pressure borrowers to pay back their debts. The loan company Lenddo, for example, will broadcast messages about repayment to a user's social network. Social media can also be used to look at whether your friends have paid back their loans. These lenders now factor the number of Facebook friends you have into their decisions to make loans The social media-plus-lending trend started more than three years ago but is just getting onto regulators' radar now. Government agencies and consumer protection groups aren't thrilled about it, saying it violates consumer privacy. Proponents say social media provides hope for borrowers who don't have a strong credit history.

Unfortunately, many of them have been hunted to near-extinction by poachers, which is why a permit to shoot a single black rhino can fetch as much as $350,000. Today, the San Francisco startup Airware announced the results of a successful field trial it ran at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, home to many endangered black and white rhino. Airware partnered with the conservancy to use specialized drones which can monitor huge swaths of land to protect rhinos against poachers.  Over the two-week test, Airware used three different drones: two fixed-wing aircraft and one flexible wing. ""They were designed to operate completely autonomously, well out of the line of sight of the pilot,"" says Airware founder and CEO Jonathan Downey. Before the drones, park rangers had been using jeeps and small aircraft to patrol for poachers and check up on the animals. ""Using drones allows them to spend a lot more time in the air, seeing a lot more detail, and for far cheaper than using traditional aircraft or jeeps,"" says the founder. Designed to operate completely autonomously, well out of the line of sight of the pilot The drones use infrared cameras for nighttime video and electro-optical cameras during the day. Because they fly so low, between 100 and 400 feet, Downey says they can capture great detail. ""Using infrared we can easily spot a campfire being used by poachers, who often come in to the park at night. The level of detail is such that we can see an elephant's trunk change from white to black after he takes a drink of cold water."" Robert Breare, chief commercial officer of the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, certainly seems pleased by the results of the test. ""The Airware control system is outstanding,"" he said in a joint press release, adding that the system ""over-delivered on his expectations."" And yet, it doesn't look like the test will lead to a lucrative contract for Airware — at least not with the conservancy. ""Far cheaper than using traditional aircraft or jeeps."" Ol Pejeta used Indiegogo to raise $46,000 for the Airware test, but the conservancy doesn't intend to pay for continued service. ""This is not something we think will turn into a huge revenue stream for us,"" Downey admits. But the partnership could be valuable for a different reason: raw experience. That $46,000 subsidized Airware's efforts to learn about completely autonomous flight. This kind of capability will be crucial for consumer drones in America, for example to power Amazon's proposed Prime Air delivery fleet. Right now there are only six FAA approved test sites for commercial drones in the US, and none are as expansive or full of live subjects as the Ol Pejeta Conservancy. Airware's bet could lead to future opportunities. ""We think [the project] can have a big impact and really showcase what this technology can do,"" says Downey. The FAA has been mandated by Congress to create a set of guidelines for commercial drone flight over US soil by the end of 2015. Stateside PETA has faced off with local hunting groups, which want to make it illegal to use drones to monitor or harass hunters on US soil. So far, they have succeeded in the state of Illinois.",0.5542316555531174,0.4457683444468826,0.8157677567624426,562,4.8932384341637007,331,5.7975830815709966,0,0,"Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

While Charter is pushing to make a merger happen, it doesn't expect it to happen through an immediate acceptance of this latest bid. The offer is an intentional lowball: just $132.50 per share, according to The Wall Street Journal, when TWC was reportedly looking for between $150 to $160. The offer — reportedly totaling $37.4 billion in cash and stock — only slightly exceeds TWC's closing price today too, of $132.40  ""We have a significant opportunity to put our companies together."" Charter argues that the offer is a fair one though, writing in a press release that TWC's share value has already been raised over interest in the deal. Rather than looking for a higher offer, Charter suggests that TWC look at the deal's long-term potential for shareholders when considering the bid. ""I believe we have a significant opportunity to put our companies together in a way that will create maximum, long-term value for shareholders and employees of both companies,"" Charter CEO Thomas Rutledge writes in an open letter to TWC CEO Robert Marcus. Rutledge knows that TWC isn't interested in his deal though, and believes it's time to address TWC's shareholders more directly. ""Our objective was to talk to management and try to get them engaged,"" Rutledge tells Bloomberg News. ""They have not, so we’re going to make our case to shareholders about why this deal is good for them and hope they ask management and the board to watch out for the interests of shareholders."" Rutledge writes in his letter that merging the companies will reduce overall costs, speed up growth, and offer tax advantages — all opportunities that shareholders would be glad to see. Both Charter's and TWC's stock are up year over year, with Charter closing today slightly above TWC. Though TWC is the larger business, Charter may be playing aggressive to get ahead of Comcast, which was previously reported to be in on the bidding war, potentially even as a partner to Charter. Charter will have major hurdles to address — TWC's management and board included — in order to make a deal happen though, but Rutledge will be ready should it come: ""We are fully prepared to finalize a deal on an extremely expedited basis.""",0.5779143366990911,0.4220856633009089,0.6761485823181873,413,4.9636803874092008,233,5.7210300429184553,0,0,Business,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

(And how: before Nest, Fadell and co-founder Matt Rogers led the iPod and iPhone teams at Apple.) It's a win-win, and Nest's investors sound ecstatic. ""It's a fantastic return,"" Lightspeed Venture Partners' Peter Nieh told The Wall Street Journal. But outside of the players directly involved in the deal, there was a second, more visceral reaction: disappointment. Nest was the first in a new wave of hardware startups built by engineers and executives eager to apply their experience building smartphones to new markets — a mission captured perfectly by Fadell's irrepressible upstart spirit in interviews and appearances. But by selling Nest seems to have undercut the optimism those companies represented, and perhaps not coincidentally, underlined a growing distrust of Google itself — a distrust shared by regular consumers, tech investors, and privacy advocates alike. I *really* don’t get why Google acquiring Nest makes sense for either Google, Nest, or any of either customers or investors in any way. Although Fadell says Nest will remain mostly independent, with its own identity, team, and even offices intact, it will most certainly become a part of Google. ""It's somewhere between YouTube and Motorola,"" Fadell said yesterday, describing two of the search giant's more famous acquisitions. Motorola has remained almost completely independent, ""firewalled"" away from Google's Android team, while YouTube has become more and more integrated over time — with a recent outpouring of anger when its comment system was tied to the niche Google+ social network. Now Nest can just raise the temperature of people's homes until they join Google+.   So what will happen to Nest? Fadell called any speculation ""totally premature"" yesterday, but that hasn't stopped customers from worrying — and most seem to think Google will ""ruin"" Nest in a variety of ways, with Google+ integration standing in for a host of potential sins. Others worry that Nest will fall victim to the ongoing platform war against Apple, although Fadell says the company will continue to support iOS. @davidhfe Spite is not illegal. Still others wondered, perhaps a bit facetiously, if Nest would become yet another in a long line of companies acquired by Google in a flurry of hype only to disappear years later. If Google's honest about not peeking at Nest user data, that means it's gonna shut it down and stripmine the tech for new google gadgets. Bummed to hear about Nest. I liked their products and assume they will eventually be shuttered like everything else Google buys. Viewed at a distance, the reaction is similar to Avis buying Zipcar: the fear that a slower, less innovative giant will kill the spirit and pace of a beloved startup. The difference, of course, is that Google is itself one of the richest and most innovative companies in the world. That it carries even the whiff of a lumbering giant is odd — especially since for tech investors, the Nest deal smacks of coldly efficient dominance. Consumers aren't the only ones feeling some angst over Google's purchase of Nest. Yesterday's news caused a big question to boil up among Silicon Valley venture capitalists. How do you play the game when Google is one of the biggest investors in tech and also one of the biggest buyers of tech startups? ""The purchase of Nest was a big win for us, of course,"" said one of the company's investors, who asked to remain anonymous. ""But at the same time you have to wonder, could this company have been 10 times bigger had it continued to go things on its own?"" can Google Ventures be trusted to keep its founder interests separate from its backers? Entrepreneurs face a similar pickle. Google has said that its venture arm is completely independent from core business, but that always seemed like wishful thinking, and yesterday's purchase will only strengthen the perception that taking an investment from Google Ventures ties a startup closely to Google itself. ""It sends some really mixed signals,"" said another Nest investor. An entrepreneur might look at this and see the upside: an investment from Google Ventures means an acquisition by Google is more likely down the road. But for the truly ambitious entrepreneurs who want to take on tech titans like Google and Facebook the question now is, can Google Ventures be trusted to keep its founder interests separate from its backers? There is no way Google is going to be able to resist doing something with the data collected from Nest thermostats/smoke+CO detectors  The question of trust is perhaps most important of all. Fadell once described the Nest thermostat to me as nothing more than an on / off switch with a lot of nuance — nuance gained by collecting huge amounts of data about your living patterns and energy needs. Adding that data to Google's formidable collection of information about nearly everyone who uses the internet struck immediate fears with privacy advocates and a growing base of skeptics who contend Google's ad-supported business model creates an anti-privacy culture. Watch what happens when Google aggregates your online data tied to a location to what is going on physically in your home via Nest.  And the timing wasn't great for the counterargument: hours before the Nest announcement, Google clarified that a controversial plan to let Google+ users easily email nearly anyone on Gmail would be more private for ""high-profile"" users. It's another in a long string of confusing messages about privacy from Google, and the Nest team did little to alleviate the concerns. give Google the chance to acquire more data, and it usually will Co-founder Matt Rogers wrote that the company ""takes privacy seriously,"" and that its privacy policy limits the use of customer data to ""providing and improving Nest's products and services."" But those services could arguably be improved by integration with other Google products, and the implications are unclear — give Google the chance to acquire more data, and it usually will. Fadell wouldn't rule out future changes yesterday. ""At this point, there are no changes to our terms of service, and that's it. That's all I can say."" It’s a shame Apple didn’t buy Nest. I feel much more comfortable when the business model is built around selling hardware. Not the data.  It's a strange set of affairs: an innovative young company led by some of the best engineers and executives in the business being acquired and validated by one of the great American businesses of the past 20 years should be a slam dunk of good PR. Instead, there's a chorus of concern — some sincere, some contrived, but all of it grounded in fear of an unchecked Google.

Nest has published a Q&A with Rogers that reveals some detail on how this new partnership will change things with the company. For starters, Nest confirms that it'll continue to support Apple and iOS products going forward — not a huge surprise, given that Google's been putting out solid versions of its apps and services for iOS for some time now. Warranties will stay the same, and Nest products will still continue to be sold at retail (though there's no word on whether or not they'll be on sale at Apple stores). ""We've had great momentum, but this is a rocket ship."" Unsurprisingly, the company is remaining coy about how it'll integrate with Google's existing product lineup. ""Nest's product line obviously caught the attention of Google and I'm betting that there's a lot of cool stuff we could do together, but nothing to share today,"" writes Rogers. He did address any potential concerns about Nest's customer data being opened up to Google for advertising or other purposes. ""Our privacy policy clearly limits the use of customer information to providing and improving Nest's products and services,"" writes Rogers.

Politico says it's not clear whether Apple gave a similar briefing to the Senate, but it points to a letter sent to CEO Tim Cook by Senators Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO) two days after the product announcement. McCaskill and Rockefeller — which also sent a letter to Home Depot about its recently discovered security breach — focused mostly on the recent leak of hundreds of celebrity nudes, many gathered through Apple's iCloud backup system.

Fitbit countered that it did not sell user data and wanted to ""work with"" Schumer.

By far the most commented issue for the FCC Net neutrality advocates have been deeply concerned about the new proposal. Though the proposal is meant to protect net neutrality — the idea that all internet traffic, no matter what it is or where it's coming from, should be treated equally — it would actually undermine it, allowing internet providers to create so-called fast lanes that might give an edge to companies that can afford to pay. Advocates would instead like to see the commission reclassify broadband as a utility, thus subjecting it to tighter regulations. Based on an automated analysis of just over 800,000 comments, the Sunlight Foundation believes that two-thirds of initial comments supported that reclassification. Now that the commenting period has closed, the commission will look through the comments and is supposed to factor their thoughts into a final set of rules for net neutrality.

""As a country that prides itself on free speech as a tenet of our constitution, I felt this sneaky tactic of limiting it as purely wrong,"" said Sherman in a statement. The bill, which has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, says that if companies make customers agree to some kind of terms and conditions, they can't enforce clauses that stop someone from posting a ""written, verbal, or pictorial review, performance assessment of, or other similar analysis of, the products, services, or conduct of a business."" That includes anything that imposes a ""penalty or fee"" or says that companies hold copyright of reviews, videos, or photographs, and the FTC can enforce the law under existing rules against unfair or deceptive behavior. It doesn't apply to trade secrets, medical information, or law enforcement reports, all of which businesses can reasonably expect to stay confidential. And non-disparagement clauses are fine if they're between an employer and employee, not a business and customer. It also doesn't close the door to defamation, libel, or slander lawsuits, a few of which are currently going through courts.

Back then, the clumsy ignorance of our lawmakers allowed a charade called the Stop Online Piracy Act to make serious steps toward becoming law. The brief history of SOPA is this: the music and movie industry lost the battle against online piracy in the 2000s, and then decided it would just be easier to get Congress to blow up the internet. The bill was so odious that it led to unprecedented efforts to kill it, including an internet ""blackout"" intended to inform internet users that Congress was about to embark on a disastrous adventure in legislative stupidity. It worked, and the bill was tabled indefinitely, but the fundamental problem Kopstein rightly underscored hasn't been fixed. The government is still pretty dumb when it comes to the internet. If you don't believe me, just look at how well Healthcare.gov turned out. It's 2014, and the future of the internet is still at stake, and there's still a lot of ignorance about technology on both sides of the aisle. But right now there's only one party in Congress that's actively threatening to kill the founding principles that have made the internet the booming success it is today. Just like it was during the SOPA crisis, people who love and understand the internet are mad again. This time it's about the looming death of net neutrality: the set of principles that so far have kept companies like Comcast and Verizon from kidnapping the internet and demanding ransom from users and other businesses on top of the fees they already pay to get internet access. As the FCC now considers caving on net neutrality with a ""paid prioritization"" scheme, after years of trying and failing to establish net neutrality protections, the issue is back in Congress. Republicans are buying into the ISP's bullshit scare tactics People who understand the history of the internet and the value it now provides to everyone accept the obvious conclusion that the internet is a utility, just like water and electricity. (As The Verge's Nilay Patel aptly pointed out, anybody who says otherwise is lying for money.) Right now advocates are trying to convince the FCC to just say that obvious fact, and do what it should have done years ago but lacked the courage to accomplish: to declare that ISPs are common carriers, subject to restrictions on how they handle the speech that travels through their cables. But internet providers don't want to be treated like common carriers, because it would, in short, stifle profits. So what's their response? To cast reclassification as ""heavy handed"" regulation from Big Government. And Republicans are buying it. There are two major themes to GOP objection that were crystalized in today's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on net neutrality regulation: ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" and ""big government is bad,"" a talking point that's probably less useful in governing than just sitting quietly and never saying anything. While each Republican member of the committee took turns trying to convey the idea of the internet to the public, turning it over in their hands like an exotic, alien object (at one point, a senator even tried to use air conditioning as a metaphor for the internet), it was Senator Ted Cruz (R, TX) who managed to sound the most aggressively clueless. ""The FCC's latest adventure in net neutrality in my view would only serve to stifle innovation and would potentially subject the internet to nanny state regulation from Washington,"" Cruz said today. ""Net neutrality is a wolf in sheep's clothing."" Cruz's thesis, something ISPs and Republicans have been spinning since Title II regulation was first whispered, is that net neutrality regulation amounts to a government takeover of the internet. To be blunt, that's simply a lie; the only thing that happened when the telephone monopoly was put in check was that telephone service got better and cheaper. The idea that net neutrality is a government takeover of the internet is a lie The internet is free precisely because of net neutrality principles it has always enjoyed. And the idea that the internet isn't broken and thus requires no care is like standing on the beach as a tsunami approaches, claiming that everything is fine simply because it hasn't reached shore. Remember AT&T and T-Mobile's ""sponsored data"" plans that privilege traffic from some companies over others? How about when AT&T blocked FaceTime and Hangouts video chatting on its mobile network for completely arbitrary reasons? The reality is that ISPs are actively trying to mess with net neutrality and have been for years. The only thing traditionally standing in their way is the FCC, and Republicans have been working for years to cripple it. ""The FCC shouldn't be endangering future investments,"" Cruz said. ""A five member government panel should not be dictating how internet services should be delivered.""     Republican politicians are famous for saying that the government shouldn't pick winners and losers in the marketplace, but their alternative for the internet is actually much worse: they want companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T to be in charge of the internet. These companies don't even really care what the laws say as long as they can be used to their benefit; Verizon, which is currently fighting against Title II reclassification, actually uses the Title II designation when it's convenient to gain access to infrastructure for a low price set by the government. Verizon told the FCC that Title II is an ""arcane regulatory framework... crafted for 19th century railroad monopolies and the early 20th century one-wire telephone world,"" and that it has ""no place in today's fast-paced and competitive internet marketplace,"" unless, of course, Verizon wants to gain competitive advantage on the government's dime. ""I believe we should protect the freedom of the internet,"" Senator Cruz said today. ""Those who are fatally strangled so often by these regulations are the little guys."" What Cruz doesn't get, and what many of his colleagues either fail to understand or are being dishonest about in service of corporate interests, is that the only winners in a world without net neutrality are the big guys. That's why 50 leading tech investors who know how the internet startup game works told the FCC that ending net neutrality would cripple young companies. ""Title II is definitely not just (so-called) heavy handed regulation for utilities or monopolies,"" Free Press policy director Matt Wood told The Verge following today's hearing. ""The core of Title II are the common carrier principles that keep networks open. Those principles prevent discrimination. They keep the ISPs from telling you what websites you can go to, which apps you can use, or what you can watch and say online."" What's most confounding about Republican support for monopolistic ISPs is that they are exemplars of a broken market, long overdue for intervention. ISPs are insular, lumbering Goliaths whose incentives often directly oppose the interests of consumers. Republicans ought to know that unregulated monopolies are far worse than government takeovers. If they don't, they might want to start listening to Comcast customer service calls. The little guys that Ted Cruz says he wants to protect have already spoken. It's time for Republicans to listen.",0.3066255565994864,0.6933744434005136,0.18968891106116628,1231,5.0836718115353374,616,6.2110389610389607,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Editorial",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The agency posted a settlement today, saying Yelp would pay $450,000 for violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a rule that limits how sites can collect information from people under 13. In its original complaint, the FTC said that while Yelp's website screened users when they signed up, from 2009 to 2013, Yelp's mobile app let anyone, regardless of age, register for an account. Once they had, they could post photos and reviews, and Yelp collected location data from their phones, thus accepting personal information on ""several thousand individuals"" who indicated that they were between 9 and 13 years old. ""Yelp doesn't promote itself as a place for children."" As part of the settlement, Yelp will need to lay out a set of privacy rules that clearly comply with the guidelines, then periodically report on how it's following them. It will also need to keep records of any complaints for ten years and, in general, let the FTC know when it makes any policy changes. Over the past few years, the FTC has laid down stricter rules for how sites have to deal with young users, and it's cracked down on companies that don't comply. Social network Path, which weathered a larger privacy scandal in 2012, paid $800,000 last year in order to settle similar charges. Apple, Google, and Amazon have all faced lawsuits for making it too easy for children to run up in-app purchase bills without parents' knowledge; Apple settled for $32.5 million, Google, recently agreed to $19 million, and Amazon is taking the fight to court. In its press release, the FTC also noted a separate $300,000 settlement for COPPA violations with mobile developer TinyCo. Yelp has posted its own announcement of the settlement, calling the problem a ""bug"" in its mobile apps. ""The good news is that only about 0.02 percent of users who actually completed Yelp's registration process during this time period provided an underage birth date, and we have good reason to believe that many of them were actually adults,"" it wrote. ""Yelp doesn't promote itself as a place for children, and we certainly don't expect or encourage them to write reviews about their plumbers, dentists, or latest gastronomic discoveries."" If it did, it would need to get affirmative consent from parents before letting anybody under 13 onto the site. An important note in all this is that COPPA violations are largely dependent on having ""actual knowledge"" that users are under 13. As Yelp notes on its blog, ""birthdates on Yelp are optional in the first place, so users are always free to register without one.""

The report from Verité, a Massachusetts-based labor watchdog, finds that 32 percent of the approximately 350,000 migrants employed at Malaysian factories have been effectively trapped in their jobs, after being forced to hand over their passports or paying steep recruitment fees that saddle them with debt. The study does not mention any technology companies by name, though the electronics sector comprises a major part of the Malaysian economy, and companies like Apple, Samsung, and Sony have suppliers there. ""unlawful and unethical recruitment practices.""   ""Verité's study is the most comprehensive look at forced labor in the Malaysian electronics sector to date,"" Verité CEO Dan Viederman said in a statement Wednesday. ""Our report provides a clear sense of the scope of the problem in the industry, as well as the root causes underlying this egregious form of abuse, which center on unlawful and unethical recruitment practices."" Verité's study follows a two-year investigation that was commissioned by the US Department of Labor. Of the 501 migrant workers interviewed, 92 percent paid recruitment fees to gain employment, and 94 percent said their passports were confiscated by their employers. More than three quarters (77 percent) of workers who paid recruitment fees said they had to borrow money to pay them, and 92 percent paid fees beyond industry standards (greater than one month's salary). Many of the migrants hailed from countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, and India. Many faced harsh living conditions, as well. Thirty percent of those surveyed reported sleeping in rooms with more than eight people, and more than 40 percent said they had no place to secure their belongings. Twenty two-percent said they had been deceived about their wages, resulting in what Viederman calls a ""one-two punch"" — exorbitant recruitment fees and low wages. Major technology companies have come under fire in recent years for alleged labor abuses in their supply chains, and several have sought to mitigate them with stronger oversight and audits. Chris Gaither, an Apple spokesman, told the New York Times that the company employs around 18,000 people and 4,000 migrant workers in Malaysia, where it has about 30 suppliers. Apple has worked to help migrant workers reclaim millions of dollars in recruitment charges since 2008, though Viederman says stronger monitoring from the industry and government is needed. ""This most modern of industrial sectors is characterized by a form of exploitation that long ago should have been relegated to the past,"" Viederman told the Times.

Is the rest of the world next? Last month, a Mr. Li in Shenyang, China, received a text from his bank's customer service number, notifying him that his credit card had accumulated reward points and telling him how to cash them in. When he followed the link and logged in, the site went dead. An hour later, he noticed more than $650 missing from his account. Only then did he realize he'd been scammed. The text had come from his bank's number, but it didn't come from his bank. The text came from his bank's number, but it didn't come from his bank Instead, it came from a fake cell tower, a racket that's reaching epidemic levels in China. Scammers use a device called a base station to set up a fake signal coming from a local house or shop. As long as it's the strongest signal available, phones will connect automatically. The phony tower can't reach the larger network, so if you try to place a call or visit a website, you'll come up empty — but unless you're actively using your phone, you'd never know the difference. From there, scammers can send texts from any number they want. In cases like Mr. Li's, that turns out to be a very lucrative trick. Qihoo 360, China's largest mobile security firm, has caught more than 1.2 billion messages from fake cell towers between April and June of this year, more than 13 million per day. Qihoo's figures only include messages caught by the company's app, so it's likely the total number is even higher.  ""It's very lucrative to have a tower device right now. People will pay big money for it,"" says Ren Huan, Qihoo 360’s head of mobile security. ""We predict that this year and next year will be the worst time for us."" Qihoo has caught 1.2 billion messages in just three months Roughly half the messages were simple advertising, sent from fake cell stations so as to dodge mass-texting fees, but Qihoo tagged another third of the messages as promoting illegal services, and 15 percent as outright fraud. The messages can appear as fake invoices, credit card statements, or phone bills from the carriers themselves. In each case, the message comes from the bank or phone company's official customer service number, giving targets no reason to doubt that the message is real. At the heart of the scam is a basic vulnerability with the GSM or 2G phone network, established in the mid-’80s before the rise of 3G and 4G networks. Towers check that each connected phone is legitimate, but there's no system to authenticate the towers themselves. When the system was designed 30 years ago, cell tower hardware was too expensive for such an attack to be practical. Now, a fake base station can be built for as little as $700, making it much easier to turn a profit. As of this April, it's a felony to mass-manufacture the devices within Chinese borders, but in the thriving world of Chinese electronics manufacturing, those restrictions can be hard to enforce. Qihoo shows the densest cluster of attacks coming not in the populous south, but a northern manufacturing city called Zhengzhou, where unauthorized hardware can be more easily manufactured and sold under the table. Chinese police have been cracking down on any factories caught with the equipment, with regular arrests and 24 production sites shut down so far this year, but judging by Qihoo's numbers the crackdown has barely put a dent in the attacks. A fake base station can be built for as little as $700, making it easy to turn a profit While China has seen the most widespread attacks, the vulnerability is being exploited on an increasingly global scale. In the US, law enforcement uses the same weaknesses to follow suspects, setting up fake towers with officially sanctioned Stingray device, although many have questioned the legality of the tactic. Reports have also shown an alarming number of fake cell towers operating in Washington DC, although it’s difficult to pin down who is behind the irregularities. Outside of the US, a similar attack was used by journalists in India to wiretap politicians, while Czech police say they’ve seen it used for industrial espionage. In a landmark paper in The Harvard Journal of Law and Technology, the ACLU's Christopher Soghoian describes how the technology has spread, and why it has become so difficult to contain. ""The fact that there are so many places in China that you can buy this stuff is alarming, but they don't have a monopoly on this technology. There are places you can buy this stuff in India, in Russia, and Israel too,"" Soghoian told The Verge. ""It's time to secure our phone calls."" ""It's time to secure our phone calls."" Some in the US government are trying to do just that. In July, Congressman Alan Grayson sent the Federal Communications Commission a formal inquiry about the problem, and the agency has since formed a task force to investigate the issue. Still, securing the network may be harder than it sounds. Modern 3G and 4G networks are immune to the attack, thanks to two-way authentication, but it will be years before the US can abandon the vulnerable GSM or 2G networks entirely, and doing so means upgrading thousands of towers across the country. So far, AT&T is leading the way, planning to abandon GSM by 2017, but that gives attackers three years to keep exploiting the vulnerability in the US, and even longer in the rest of the world. In the meantime, China is relying on scrappier fixes like the Qihoo app, which blocks any messages it identifies as suspicious but can't stop them from being delivered to the phone. Beyond that, researchers like Huan are relying on Chinese police getting smarter about tracking down the people buying and selling the towers. ""We actually have a lot of data from the end user,"" Huan says, ""but we are not law enforcement. And then there are the agencies responsible for catching these guys, but they don't have any data.""",0.5111267635237857,0.4888732364762143,0.8357790815674826,1024,4.7724609375,539,5.9294990723562151,0,0,"Mobile, Tech, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

But none of those things are truly next gen, at least not compared to my favorite aspect of The Witcher 3: the hero can actually grow a virtual beard. The Witcher 3 is a sprawling fantasy epic that spans many, many hours. It stars a grizzled monster hunter named Geralt, who sports a nasty scar on his face and two swords across his back. At the beginning of the game, he has a bit of stubble, but due to a visit with a king he's forced to get a clean shave, and from there you can watch his facial hair progress. The beard grows slowly over time, adding a bit of length with each in-game day that passes. Some towns have barbers where you can shave it off, but I never did: the growth of Geralt's beard felt like an important progress tracker, like marking down my kid's height on the wall. (Well, like that except completely unimportant.) Every time I saw his face in close-up, I analyzed it for signs of growth. It was like having a virtual Chia pet. I kept using the PS4's share feature to snap photos of it in different locations around the world. In most role playing games, your progress is documented with numbers. By the end you have more powerful spells and armor that can take more abuse. But you don't really see the toll that time has taken on your hero. For Geralt, all you have to do is look at his grizzled, grey mane to see the hardships he's been through. At one point toward the end of the game, Yennifer, one-third of a witcher / witch / witch love triangle, complimented Geralt on his new distinguished look. It made me feel weirdly proud. Expensive new armor makes Geralt look powerful, but a beard makes him feel real.

Following a series of rumors, today Ubisoft officially unveiled the latest game in the series, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, which will shift the setting to Industrial Revolution-era London in 1868. It will feature both male and female protagonists, siblings Jacob and Evie Frye — the developer came under fire for its comments on female characters at last year's E3 — although Jacob appears to be the game's lead. It's being developed at Ubisoft's Quebec City studio, instead of Montreal where the series is normally developed. Syndicate will let you enlist the help of street gangs during your quest, and the studio claims it will be the fastest game in the series, with a new emphasis on weapons like hidden blades and brass knuckles. The team describes it as more of a brawler than previous entries. London's criminal underworld appears to play a big part in the story, as Ubisoft describes it:  In Assassin's Creed Syndicate you'll play as Jacob Frye, an assassin born and bred poised to take over the criminal underworld of London during the Industrial Revolution. Amidst blossoming conflicts between newly crowned kings of industry and the working class they exploit for all they're worth, Jacob will work in the shadows as he climbs to the top of the criminal underground as the head of one of the city's most notorious street gangs.   Unity, the previous main entry in the series, was the first built exclusively for the new generation of consoles (ACIV launched on both generations), and featured a stunningly realized virtual version of Paris during the French Revolution. Unfortunately, it was also marred by a seemingly never-ending string of technical issues. The new game's announcement shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. Much like other blockbuster series, including Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed has become an annualized franchise, with at least one new release coming out each year since its debut in 2007. In fact, there's already been an Assassin's Creed game this year, with the launch of the 2D Chronicles spin-off. Next year, meanwhile, will also see the premiere of a live-action Assassin's Creed movie starring Michael Fassbender. Syndicate is launching on October 23rd for PC, PS4, and Xbox One.

A few moments later you see a naked couple taking a bath together. This is a game that really wants you to know that it is dark, mature fantasy, and it wastes no time telling you that.  The latest entry in the Polish role playing series is essentially what would happen if you mashed up Game of Thrones and Grand Theft Auto. It takes place in a gritty fantasy realm beleaguered by horrific happenings. Not unlike Westeros, here is a place where magic and monsters exist alongside people. Characters die in brutal ways, and seemingly every story has a tragic element. The Witcher 3 is also an open-world game, a huge virtual playground where you can go practically anywhere and tackle things however you like. If the main story doesn't interest you, simply wander off and hunt some monsters in the woods or investigate murders in a bustling medieval town.  But no matter what you choose, you're going to have some fun. Wild Hunt once again stars series hero Geralt, who comes from a line of supernaturally powerful monster hunters called witchers. He's basically a genetically engineered problem solver: he travels the world aiding everyone, from kings to peasants, armed with magic spells, superhuman strength, and the ability to track like a bloodhound. Think of him as a work-for-hire Jedi who doesn't mind slicing people up with his giant swords. (He carries two — a silver one for monsters and a steel one for regular folk.) Wild Hunt sees Geralt on a quest to find Ciri, his former student, who is being chased by a mysterious, powerful group called The Hunt, for reasons that aren't exactly clear. Over the course of the game, he finds himself constantly one step behind his protégé and her pursuers, venturing from bustling cities to frigid, haunted islands. There's a lot going on in the game, as this all happens against the backdrop of a war and a prophecy that the appearance of The Hunt signifies the end of days. There are two previous games and multiple books' worth of backstory and lore, but even still Wild Hunt is remarkably welcoming to new players — don't let that three in the title fool you. I've never played a Witcher game before, and I was able to ease into the world with little problem. There are plenty of optional ways to catch up, whether it's the in-game encyclopedia or just conversations with other characters. But you don't have to do any of this: the core story is simple enough to understand even if you have no knowledge of the game's universe. You might not know every name mentioned, but you'll get by just fine. Part of this has to do with the way the game is structured. Instead of one giant, epic quest, Wild Hunt feels more like a collection of short stories. Each quest is like its own self-contained thing that also, usually, connects back to the main story. Like in every other RPG, everyone you'll encounter wants something from you, whether it's the mage who can't perform a spell until you find his lost goat, or the townsfolk who won't give you any information until you kill that pesky, hen-eating werewolf. But Wild Hunt feels different because virtually every quest has a fascinating story nested within its objective. You're still doing relatively straightforward things like killing monsters and tracking down thieves, but they always feel like more than simple fetch quests. Part of the reason is the top-level storytelling, which, much like Game of Thrones, constantly keeps you on edge with its brutality. Even the simplest-sounding quest will have elements of death or betrayal, and even though I eventually learned that bad things would happen basically all the time, these scenes still managed to catch me off guard. In one of the early villages I encountered, for example, a woman asked me to help her find her missing frying pan. I found two corpses while getting it back. And that's just a basic quest, as things get much more brutal from there. There's even a scene that can only be described as the Red Wedding with bears, and it's just as awful as that sounds. Luckily, the drama also lets up every now and then, with some refreshing doses of self-aware humor. While this is a world where corpses hang from trees and stillborn babies can turn into monsters, it's also one where you can have awkward sex with a sorceress on top of a stuffed unicorn. These quests also feel incredibly dynamic. While there is a main storyline to follow, and plenty of side quests that you can seek out by visiting local message boards, the most interesting moments in Wild Hunt are when you find yourself unexpectedly pulled into a brand new story. Just in the course of riding my horse from one town to the next I stumbled across wagons being attacked by monsters, young children orphaned by the war, and even a feeble, dragon-like creature trapped in a cage. I didn't go looking for any of these moments, but they kept presenting themselves, and almost every single one ended up being an engrossing tale that pulled me away from the core story. (They're also mostly optional.) For me, side quests in RPGs are usually just a tool to earn some gold and experience, and I don't think about them much beyond that. But in Wild Hunt, I welcomed them. Every time I started up the game, I was excited about seeing something new or funny or sad. In fact, the only place the game really stumbled is toward the end, when the focus shifted to the main story of finding Ciri and confronting her attackers, and moves away from the smaller tales. There are some touching, important moments to be found, but the whole thing is drawn out for way too long and just becomes exhausting. Several times I thought the story had reached its climax only to realize there were still multiple hours left to go. In fact, what could be described as the last chapter of Wild Hunt is longer than some entire games. This is obviously a huge game, but unlike a lot of open worlds, it's also one that feels lively. The developers at CD Projekt Red have spent a lot of time ensuring that it's not just a collection of towns connected by empty space. Even outside of the quests I stumbled across, there was a lot to do out in the world, whether hunting monsters or exploring ancient ruins. The game is so beautiful and so full of surprises, that I rode my horse most places instead of using the fast travel option that lets you zip around the map. I didn't want to miss anything. I absolutely loved just trotting around, watching the sun set and rise over the mountains, lakes, or wherever I happened to be at that moment. It's a nice palette cleanser after dismembering some ghouls in a bloody swordfight. Of course, like most modern open-world games — whether it's Dragon Age Inquisition or Assassin's Creed Unity — this freedom comes at a price. Wild Hunt isn't the worst offender, but I still ran into plenty of glitches and bugs over the course of my playthrough. Some were just visual, like the jittery goat that was stuck in the background of an otherwise heartfelt cut-scene, or the corpses of slaughtered sirens that would float in mid-air at the edge of a cliff. But others actually made it hard to progress in the game. At one point I was battling a wraith, which would dive into the ground and then pop out for a surprise attack. Problem was, halfway through the fight it decided it no longer wanted to pop out again. Since I need to kill it to fulfill a contract, this meant that I had no choice but to abandon the quest and restart. I was actually very intimidated when I first started playing Wild Hunt. Not only was I unfamiliar with the franchise, but the developers have said that it can take upwards of 100 hours to complete, depending on how deep you want to dig. That's just a huge number; I love RPGs, but I don't have a few dozen hours to spare. I managed to finish the game in somewhere between 30 and 40 hours, and I don't really feel like I missed out on anything. There was plenty of stuff I avoided — I didn't spend much time on alchemy or crafting, and there's a trading card game I skipped completely — but I’m still entirely satisfied by the experience. The fact that The Witcher 3 feels like a collection of quests rather than one huge epic makes it easier to pick and choose what you want to do, without a terrible case of FOMO. In fact, I’ve made sure to keep a save file from before the end game kicks in. I don’t need to experience this lengthy game again, but already I can feel the urge to go for a quick horse ride through the forests in the north. The only thing I don’t know is what I’ll find when I get there. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is available May 19th on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

Castlevania owner Konami appears to have little interest in releasing video games these days, but Igarashi is back with a new, self-proclaimed Igavania — it's called Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, and it just broke $1 million in crowdfunding less than 24 hours after it went live on Kickstarter. From the concept art, Bloodstained certainly looks like one of Igarashi's Castlevania titles. The suitably tormented lead character is Miriam, ""an orphan scarred by an alchemist curse which slowly crystallizes your skin,"" who will have to fight through — yes — a castle filled with demons. However, the game uses Unreal Engine 4 and is described as 2.5D, meaning fans of the intricate pixel art associated with Castlevania may be disappointed.  Bloodstained is 2.5D for ""financial and artistic reasons."" While 2D artwork can be very time-consuming and expensive to produce, the Kickstarter page says the choice was made for ""both financial and artistic reasons,"" with the 2D gameplay style described as ""non-negotiable."" Igarashi is said to be ""very excited about exploring the paths a 2.5D style opens up within the classic Igavania formula. As he begins a new chapter of his career as a developer, he's looking forward to trying things that will enhance, rather than detract from, that core gameplay."" Bloodstained will be developed by Inti Creates, the studio behind several Mega Man games and co-developers of original creator Keiji Inafune's revivalist project Mighty No. 9. Renowned Castlevania composer Michiru Yamane is also on board to score the soundtrack along with Ippo Yamada, known for his work on Resident Evil and the Mega Man series. David Hayter, who voiced Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid series before being replaced by Kiefer Sutherland, will play villain Gebel. Bloodstained is set for a March 2017 release on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The project is already funded, but if you want to place an order now, $28 will get you a digital copy of the game.

Besson announced on Twitter this morning that he's started work on an adaptation of Valerian, a French comic series that's supposed to be a mixture of space opera, adventure, and time travel. It focuses on a man and woman who are able to warp through space and time, doing so as part of a group that's meant to protect Earth and other planets.  Besson's last film was a bigger hit at the box office than with critics The full title of Besson's film is Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. It'll star Cara Delevingne, who'll soon be appearing in the film adaptation of John Green's Paper Towns, and Dane DeHaan, who played the Green Goblin in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Besson is aiming for a 2017 release, with work beginning at the end of this year. The potential outcome of Besson returning to a big sci-fi world should be very exciting for many fans of The Fifth Element, who have kept their fingers crossed for years that he'd make another universe that was just as lively. Of course, Besson's most recent sci-fi hasn't been quite as memorable — Lucy, which sits at 66 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, received some pretty negative reviews.

It's all a fake show. So its really #Tmobilelikehell  Sprint tried to buy T-Mobile last year Sprint has lost ground to T-Mobile in recent years as the two companies jostle for third place in the US carrier market. Sprint was reportedly aiming to buy T-Mobile in 2014, but finally abandoned its plans after being faced with too many regulatory issues. Claure was hired as Sprint's new CEO soon after news of the failed deal broke, and was expected to make the company competitive after years of under-performance, combating T-Mobile's own aggressive marketing with new deals of his own. Apparently part of his approach also involves squabbling with rivals online. The late-night tweetstorm didn't get an immediate reply from the normally talkative Legere, but you can bet the T-Mobile boss wasn't cowed into submission by the force of his rival's words. Legere uses Twitter constantly, and doesn't just aim his public criticisms at his direct industry rivals, cheerfully constructing hashtags to lambaste other companies and individuals. He's called out the FCC in the past for its ""disastrous"" spectrum auction, and even entered into a war of words with Donald Trump — while staying in a Trump hotel. Based on these past interactions, Claure's testy response could be the beginnings of a beautiful new animosity between the two men.",0.3570278417580245,0.6429721582419755,0.8207290683344332,480,4.9749999999999996,294,5.8639455782312924,0,0,"Mobile, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It updated GarageBand this week to allow for tracks to be published from the app into Apple Music's Connect section, a social area that allows artists to post news, photos, and songs.  Getting on Connect still requires jumping through hoops It's an interesting update, but it's not entirely clear how useful this will be. Musicians have to have a Connect account before they can publish into it, and having a Connect account still requires jumping through the hoops needed to get your music in iTunes. It's certainly doable for small artists, but it's not nearly as easy as throwing music up on Bandcamp or SoundCloud — two platforms that have proven to be excellent starting points for emerging artists. They're also much more shareable. Nonetheless, Apple is very much trying to take back the crown for digital music, and part of that is appealing to small artists — or at least claiming to. More than likely, it'll be those small artists who are working in GarageBand (and are in the clear to publish whatever they'd like online). GarageBand is also far from a professional app, so this update is very much aimed at very small artists. Still, the update makes for a nice convenience. It's also potentially important for Apple, as it'd really like to get artists using Connect — if they don't, it's yet another social flop for Apple. In addition to the Connect integration, Apple is also expanding the type of sounds GarageBand is geared toward. The update adds a huge library loops and synth patches for EDM and hip-hop, which is probably more along the lines of what people are making on their computers anyway. Force Touch control is also added in this latest update for people using new MacBooks.

Locals tell the media they're worried the bloated, smelly carcass will explode, and what's worse is that their fears aren't unfounded, as ""whale explosions"" have happened before. But the most interesting part of this story isn't that this rare event is taking place before our eyes, but rather that we don't hear about potentially explosive dead marine mammals more often. After all, the decomposition stages that this carcass is currently demonstrating are pretty typical.   ""release is sometimes slow, and sometimes catastrophic."" ""Pressure release is sometimes slow, and sometimes catastrophic,"" says Bruce Mate, director of the marine biology institute at Oregon State University. Mate has dealt with a lot of dead whales throughout his career, so he's also seen his fair share of bloated remains. ""The gas buildup is just a normal part of the degradation of tissue."" That's why he isn't all that worried about the whale that washed up on the beach at Trout River, in Newfoundland. ""Dead animals buoy up to the surface all the time, and they float there until the pressure is released through some weak point,"" he says. The weak points are often ones that are already in place, such as a whale's mouth or anus. But hungry sharks can also contribute to the creation of these sorts of weak points. But why does gas build up in these whales in the first place? Wolfgang Weinmann, a forensic toxicologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, explained in an email to The Verge that the gases that build up in dead animals ""come from different sources."" In this situation, he said, putrefaction and fermentation are likely the culprits. During putrefaction the proteins in an animal's tissues break down. This produces a number of ""stinky gases,"" Weinmann wrote, in addition to methane. It's also what causes organ liquefaction. Fermentation, on the other hand, is the process in which various tissues dry out. This produces a number of other gases, such as carbon dioxide. So when putrefaction and fermentation come together, you can sometimes end up with a spectacularly bloated carcass. And because whales have a thick layer of blubber beneath their skin, air trapped within stays mainly in the whale until its skin degrades — or until someone decides it's time to relieve all that pressure. Spectacular because of its size As for the impressive nature of these explosions, it really just has to do with size, Mate says. Because decomposition is taking place in such a large animal, more gas and pressure can build up inside its remains. ""You don't get this type of exciting or dramatic response when you are looking at a squirrel roadkill or a raccoon along the road,"" he says. ""But the same process is going on in the squirrel, it's just at a much smaller scale."" And make no mistake, Mate says, the pressure building up inside this animal ""will release itself eventually"" — it just might not be the sort of explosion we're imagining. Slow deflations, he says, work just as well. Even so, the town should hire a boat to drag the carcasses out to sea, just in case, Mate says. Once sufficiently far away from the town, someone can perform a controlled release of the whales' internal pressure by making a shallow slit with a long-handled knife. ""In my experience,"" he says, ""you don't have to go down all the way to where the pressure is — just create a weakness and walk away."" organs ""propelled out 30, 50 feet."" But Mate admits that even a controlled release can be botched. If someone were to go in too deep, then the release could be ""catastrophic,"" he says. ""There have been people who have stood on top of these animals and have been blown into the air."" When this happens, a whale's internal organs are ""sometimes propelled out 30, 50 feet."" If the release is done correctly, however, the carcass would slowly deflate and sink to the bottom, providing tons of food to the animals below. Unfortunately, this idea probably won't sit well with some of the town's inhabitants, as many are hoping to preserve and exhibit the whale skeleton as a tourist attraction. This could still happen, but an announcement from the Royal Ontario Museum yesterday, in which the Museum said it would send researchers to recover two of the nine whale carcasses that have recently washed up in the area, might foil these plans. Already, locals have expressed displeasure with the idea of parting with the bloated blue whale. ""It's not going to be no small feat to move this to Ontario,"" Jenny Parsons, a restaurant operator in Trout River, told CBC Radio's As It Happens. Ideally, Parsons would like to see the whale removed from the community while it decomposes, and then returned once the skeleton is clean. That, she said, makes more sense than moving the whole thing to Toronto. Mate thinks keeping the skeleton is feasible — he has done just that several times — but also says that making that happen is expensive and complicated. The team that will prepare the skeleton will need to remove all the soft tissue, meaning about 85 percent of the whale's mass. Then, they'll have to figure out how to dispose of the flesh, which won't be easy. ""You don't just put something like that casually in the back of your pickup, and drive it out to some rural area,"" he says. But if they really want to keep the skeleton, they can — ""it's just a really big project.""",0.32943879156091316,0.6705612084390868,0.17412854715484335,966,4.7857142857142856,504,5.9226190476190474,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, it has taken years for the discovery to be replicated by another independent team, which the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) requires. Now the element, with the approval of the IUPAC, can be named and added to the periodic table, extending our understanding of transuranium elements. The newest instance of element 117 was created by a team at the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research in Germany, whose findings were published in Physical Review Letters. Like the team at the JINR, the group managed to create the element by firing Calcium isotopes at radioactive Berkelium — which is no simple task.

As with other transuranium elements, ununseptium is highly unstable, and has a brief half life of about 80 milliseconds.

Their findings, published in the journal Cell Reports, show that skin cells of infertile men can be changed into stem cells and take on the characteristics of primordial germ cells when implanted in mice. While the development falls just short of creating viable sperm cells that can fertilize an egg, the news gives hope to the roughly 9 percent of men in the US suffering from infertility. The scientists harvested skin cells from three infertile donors and engineered them into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Those cells were then placed inside the testes of lab mice, where they became germ-cell-like-cells (GCLCs).  Skin cells from mice have already been coaxed into functioning sperm and eggs cells in the past, resulting in normal fertilization. However, as the researchers assert in their paper, the requirements for human gamete production are not perfectly understood. Now, even though the GCLCs are unable to support conception, the scientists are confident that the same technique can one day be used to create fertile cells. An experimental model to study sperm development The findings show the first time that cells from men with fertility problems could be used to create sperm precursors. Similar work at the University of Pittsburgh showed that germ-like cells could be created from fertile men in 2012. ""Our results are the first to offer an experimental model to study sperm development,"" lead researcher Dr. Reijo Pera told The Telegraph.

A new plan involves a series of diesel-powered pumps that would send water back up a section of the state's aqueduct, watering fields and keeping the economy humming in the process. The aqueduct would typically send water down the 420-mile system, and it's not exactly built to go the other way, reports the Associated Press. California is in a state of emergency The plan, which could cost between $1.5 to $9.5 million, would pump the water up the channel, then over locks to keep it from flowing back down. The water's only traveled back that way once, the AP says, during heavy rains in 1983 when emergency pumps effectively kept the system from flooding. California is currently in the midst of its driest year in recorded history, due mainly to low rainfall, as well as light snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Last week, Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency urging state residents to conserve water and suggesting plans to invest in dams and reservoirs. That's on top of an existing partnership with NASA to monitor the state's snowpack and groundwater resources using satellites and airplanes. The water that's a part of this plan would not be for everyone. According to the AP, it stemmed from five water groups, including Bakersfield, which is a key agricultural haven. That group wants to move a mass of water up through a 33-mile section of the aqueduct near the middle of the state this summer, though needs state approval first.

However, Americans still have a choice in whether or not to mitigate these changes or see them worsen irreversibly by the end of the century. ""The warming trend is primarily the result of human activity"" The National Climate Assessment is a Congressionally-commissioned report written by a group of more than 300 climate experts. The third of its kind, the report was instituted by the Global Change Research Act of 1990. However, this effort contrasts with previous ones in that scientists are now much more confident in their research and their subsequent call for action. As the report reads, ""Continued warming and an increased understanding of the U.S. temperature record, as well as multiple other sources of evidence, have strengthened our confidence in the conclusions that the warming trend is clear and primarily the result of human activities.""  The conclusions themselves are dire. The northeastern United States alone, for instance, has received more heavy precipitation in the last half century than any other region in the US, and the sea level is approximately eight inches higher there than the global average. Heat waves, flooding, and accelerated sea level changes pose threats to people, agriculture, fishing, and infrastructures in major eastern cities, prompting 11 of the 12 northeastern states to develop adaptive strategies to curb the damage. ""The findings... underscore the need for urgent action to combat the threats from climate change."" In response to the findings of the assessment, the Obama White House issued a statement calling for immediate action to combat climate change. ""The findings in this National Climate Assessment underscore the need for urgent action to combat the threats from climate change, protect American citizens and communities today, and build a sustainable future for our kids and grandkids."" The response comes during a week focused on climate initiatives, which will see the president holding a summit on green building tactics and, according to CNN, will announce new solar energy plans.

Previous studies have demonstrated that birds in that area have better survival rates than those near the Japanese Fukushima reactor that experienced a meltdown in 2011. Researchers think that's because these birds have had more time to adapt to radiation. So they decided to test this theory by taking feathers and blood samples from 13 species of birds in both low- and high-radiation areas surrounding the Ukrainian reactor. They found that birds living in high-radiation areas had much higher levels of glutathione in their blood. Glutathione is an antioxidant that helps animals get rid of the highly reactive, damaging molecules that are created when radiation comes in contact with biological tissues. Furthermore, high glutathione levels were linked to lower amounts of genetic damage in the birds' cells.

But the conflict just continues to show how Instagram can't quite get along with all of the artists on its service. Despite its prohibition on nudity being a recurring source of controversy, Instagram's only explanation is this: ""We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram.""

There's currently an arms race in Bitcoin mining, the intense computing required to generate new units of the increasingly popular virtual currency that approximates cash on the internet. And now the companies that produce high-end equipment for generating Bitcoin are here in Vegas, pitching their wares on the convention floor. Perhaps the best-known source of high-end mining equipment is Butterfly Labs, which came out with some of the first chips that were custom-built for ""mining"" Bitcoin. The company has teamed up with BitPay, a payments processor, and BlockChain, which runs a Bitcoin wallet service, to set up a Bitcoin-themed booth in the South Hall of the convention. Butterfly Labs is presenting the prototype of the Monarch, its fastest and most efficient Bitcoin-mining card yet. The new cards will retail for $2,196. A robust market has increased the interest in Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining Bitcoin has been on a tear lately, with the price at $972.74 apiece as of this writing. That robust market has increased the interest in Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining. But because of the way Bitcoin was designed, mining produces diminishing returns as time goes on. The simple mining rig Butterfly Labs had set up at their booth, using a 250 gigahash per second miner, was producing just .02 Bitcoin per day, or $16.90. ""Mining is a treadmill,"" said Dave McClain, account manager at Butterfly Labs. ""You've got to be reinvesting money into more hardware and the latest hardware. It's like the lottery; the more tickets you buy, the better your chances."" Bitcoin has spawned a secondary economy of goods, services, companies, financial infrastructure, and peer-to-peer transactions, along with the extensive efforts put into mining. Butterfly Labs says it has shipped more than 45,000 miners, and it's just one of many companies now producing custom chips. KnCMiner, a competitor, is also at CES showing its latest hardware, and claims its customers generate 70 percent of new bitcoins. Another competitor, HashFast, claims to have started shipping its ultra-fast Baby Jet rigs in late December (although customers say the company is past due on its shipments). The technology is now progressing by leaps and bounds, with second generation chips nearly doubling efficiency of the first generation. Since the chips can't be used for anything else, these advancements only apply to Bitcoin mining. That gives weight to critics who say Bitcoin wastes energy. But mining does more than produce new bitcoins — that computing power is also what's used to process Bitcoin transactions and record them in the public record. If Bitcoin sticks around the technology will continue to be useful. If the currency fails, this miniature industry that sprang up so fast will disappear with it. Bitcoin may be a weird fit for CES, but it's yet another sign that the currency is moving into the mainstream. Over at the Bitcoin booth, CES visitors stopped by with tales of their own mining efforts, or the friend who bought 16 cards and started spinning them up in the basement. Most people, however, were intrigued but clueless. One man wandered up to squint at the display, and started to stumble through a question.

I chose the latter. Yes, it is my fault for getting us in such a position in the first place, but the go forward decision was rather simple. I didn’t want to ever get in a position where we were desperate for cash. This directly contradicts what Fab told The Verge at the time, when it stated that the company was ""profitable.""

Perhaps the most impressive thing about the very first Formula E race is how much it looked like the new sport belongs in the world of auto racing. The evenly-matched electric cars put on a mostly dazzling show around a very tight course on the streets of Beijing, and Formula 1 test driver Lucas Di Grassi became the first ever winner in the series. The new sport is as much about innovation as it is about racing The brand new series is, aside from being electric, designed very similarly to F1, from the look of the cars to being run by the same governing body (the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, or FIA). But the twenty skilled drivers who filled out the field in this first-of-its-kind, all-electric race were very obviously hungry to get a place in history as the series' first winner. The result was white-knuckle racing from the first lap until the final turn when Nico Prost, son of F1 legend Alain Prost (and a reserve driver in that sport) attempted to block former F1 driver Nick Heidfeld and sent his opponent careening into a barrier where he went airborne and flipped multiple times. It was a hot-headed moment that could have seriously marred an otherwise good first day for the new sport, but that Heidfeld walked away unscathed meant it was also the first successful test of the cars’ overall safety. What FIA is trying to accomplish with Formula E differs from the agenda of most other major motorsports. They are adamant that Formula E’s main purpose is rooted in the general promotion and proliferation of all electric vehicles. The Formula E website states that the series ""represents a vision for the future of the motor industry over the coming decades, serving as a framework for R&D around the electric vehicle, accelerating general interest in these cars and promoting sustainability."" It’s why this entire first championship season will see teams run the same exact cars set up according to factory specifications; FIA wants the focus of the technical side of the series to be on electrical engine and battery innovation. This made the competition very close for most of the debut race, and created far more passing than an F1 race would feature. The absence of roaring combustion engines was jarring, but it meant you could hear so much more of the stress that’s constantly put on the cars, like the rattle that the one-ton machines made when they’d hit a bump, or the squelch of the tires as the drivers piloted through the turns. Motorsport die-hards will still complain about how ""quiet"" the racing is, but that’s a battle that FIA can’t win, and is part of why their attention is on attracting new fans. Quieter racing is jarring, but not a deal-breaker There were hiccups in the debut, though. The cars still show their power limits on long straightaways, there was at least one electrical issue when a driver lost power on the track, and things like the on-site DJ and the Benny Hill-ish way that the teams have to swap cars mid-race need be refined. Elsewhere, the widely criticized FanBoost feature (where fans can vote pre-race to give three drivers a 5-second power increase) was mostly absent from the overall picture. Two of the drivers to win the vote had early troubles, and race winner Di Grassi was the third armed with the boost but the broadcast did little to inform about when, where, and if he ever even used the extra power. In fact, Fox Sports 1 — which has the broadcast rights for Formula E in the United States — had more glaring problems. The young network cut to commercial without warning multiple times, displayed incorrect graphics, and although FIA announcers Jack Nicholls and Dario Franchitti did an admirable job, the insertion of their commentary into the Fox's broadcast was rough. But based on this first race, existing motorsport fans who have doubted the success of Formula E should give it a chance. And if FIA has its way, those fans' interest would just be icing on the cake. Their focus remains making new fans of this new breed of an old sport, and the debut race in Beijing was as good a first step as they could have hoped for.",0.5671184239520803,0.43288157604791966,0.5559716436366914,746,4.7573726541554961,406,5.8965517241379306,0,0,"Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

While it's not unusual for employees to sign a non-disparagement clause, it's not clear how common this practice is for customers.

Starting early in the morning, users have been greeted with a cluster of spinning wheels in place of the normal dashboard. “Make it stop,” says a button at the top. Click it, and Mark Ruffalo will explain to you in a video why the FCC (represented whimsically by stock footage of Santa Claus) needs to stop cable companies (a man in a sweater and hard hat) from slowing down the internet (an exploding Earth, covered with a loading sign). Other sites have their own banners, glitchy videos, and explanations of why they’re joining the Battle for the Net — an attempt to get Congress and the FCC to ban “fast lane” deals between web services and broadband companies. By definition, every fast lane creates a slow lane, so protesters have coalesced around the loading “wheel of death” to symbolize the effect. But back at Tumblr’s New York headquarters, the issue isn’t quite settled yet. “Are we aestheticizing this loader?” muses designer Zack Sultan. “Are we aestheticizing the iconography of our persecutors?” Copywriter Tag Savage tentatively agrees. “I think we are. It’s now a totem.” “Now everybody wants the loader all the time.” From there, they move on to explaining a documentary on Gore Vidal’s Caligula. But a more serious question pervades the discussion: how do you compress a long and complicated policy fight into a single day and a single symbol? And how much does it matter? Tumblr general counsel Ari Shahdadi helped instigate the day of action, which was organized by pro-net neutrality groups Demand Progress, Engine Advocacy, Fight for the Future, and the Free Press Action Fund. One floor up, he and public policy lead Liba Rubenstein have been monitoring feedback and directing the occasional tweak to the page — users were worried, for example, about the amount of information that an automated calling program gathered before putting them in touch with their Congressional representatives, and some seemed leery of even dialing in (""Kids don’t use phones to call people,"" Savage explains). But Shahdadi believes the overall response has been overwhelmingly positive, especially for something as difficult to explain as net neutrality. ""For SOPA/PIPA it was just much easier,"" says Shahdadi, referencing the 2012 blackout campaign that has set the bar for internet activism ever since. ""You just had to get this bill to not get passed. Here it’s like — oh, we need to convince an independent regulatory agency to promulgate rules under a certain authority that they haven’t used before, and part of that is reclassifying, but then they have to forbear from certain… it starts getting byzantine and ridiculous."" ""It starts getting byzantine and ridiculous."" It’s the same problem that activists have had with things like NSA reform. But in this case, net neutrality supporters are pushing for a specific goal: getting the FCC to redefine broadband as a telecommunication service instead of an ""information"" one. This would give the agency more leeway to set net neutrality restrictions, and it would make it harder for ISPs to sue and get the rules thrown out in court — something Verizon managed to do to the old rules earlier this year. Title II reclassification, as it’s called, could be politically disastrous for FCC chair Tom Wheeler; a former chair referred to the likely fallout as ""World War III."" It’s anathema to many Republicans, who say it would tie up companies in regulation and tempt the FCC to abuse its newly granted power. Wheeler has previously leaned towards using a more nebulous section of telecom law to justify his rules. But he’s facing increasing pressure to change his mind. Marvin Ammori, a lawyer and activist who serves on the Board of Directors for several nonprofits, doesn’t think the net neutrality fight is a sure win. But he also believes there’s something of a public consensus on the issue. ""We have ten times more support right now than we did at this stage in the SOPA fight,"" he says, pointing to a highly favorable analysis of the record-breaking number of comments to the FCC. The main issue is creating an environment where Wheeler feels empowered to reclassify broadband, especially by getting Congressional support. ""In DC, the people to reach are sort of moderate and centrist conservatives,"" he says — liberals jumped on board early, and some conservatives will never be convinced. Title II includes more potentially restrictive rules like price controls, though the FCC isn’t required to implement any of them. Libertarian-leaning nonprofit group TechFreedom, which organized its own day of action, warns it will ""trigger endless litigation, cripple investment, slow broadband deployment and upgrades, and thus harm underserved communities."" All of this is way, way more complicated than anything people probably saw during the day of action, although Tumblr and other participating sites linked out to more detailed information. Rubenstein points out that that ""net neutrality"" and the ""open internet"" have become nebulous phrases used even by cable companies themselves, so it’s necessary to be a little more specific. ""If it’s just about ‘We love net neutrality,’ that’s not necessarily going to move the needle."" Even so, the main focus is on what a world without meaningful net neutrality would be like. Hence, the wheel.   The ideas behind net neutrality have stayed relatively constant over time, but the way we talk about them is constantly evolving. From 2007 to 2010, when the FCC’s Open Internet Order was adopted, the major threat was Comcast, which had been caught throttling BitTorrent traffic on its network. If Comcast could all but block an entire file transfer protocol, what else could it do? Would telecoms decide to degrade online phone services or other things that competed with their networks? As internet usage caps became more common, a more subtle form of discrimination emerged: ISPs could give certain services a boost by not counting their usage towards the monthly limit. Now, the issue isn’t whether ISPs could degrade a service. It’s whether they could reserve their upgrades for paying customers, leaving the rest of the internet stuck in the past. The minute a faster option is available, we'll adopt that as the norm ""The spinning wheel of death really was this incredibly simple way of crystallizing what the issue was without exaggerating,"" says Rubenstein. Poor-quality internet service is already a reality in many places, and the idea that ""fast lanes"" will kill the incentive to make it better isn’t a far-fetched one. ""The idea that the standard that we have now will always be the standard that we feel comfortable with, and that the minute a faster option is available we won’t immediately adopt that as the norm, is just totally ignorant of the way the internet has worked since Day One,"" she says. Of course, it’s still a big simplification. Netflix’s ongoing fight with ISPs and the resulting congestion, for example, is a highly visible ""slowdown,"" and CEO Reed Hastings has been outspoken about the need for regulation. But no matter how easy it is to mention Netflix in the same breath as net neutrality, the problem isn’t covered by the rules being proposed right now. The Open Internet framework has always covered the ""last mile"" between ISPs and individual subscribers, not traffic on the huge ""backbone"" cables of the internet, which Netflix is paying to improve. The day of action isn’t going to change minds — ""I think if you’ve formed an opinion for or against [Title II], you’re there. Okay, fine, you’re done,"" says Shahdadi. But according to statistics gathered by Battle for the Net, it mobilized a lot of people, whether avowed supporters or simply internet users who were alerted by the banners. 22 hours into the day-long ""slowdown"" period, 286,192 people had called Congress and 2,167,092 sent emails. The FCC, which has already received 1.5 million net neutrality comments, got another 722,364 — enough to take down its servers. Over 10,000 websites participated by posting a ""loading"" widget or other notification, including Tumblr, Netflix, Vimeo, Kickstarter, Reddit, and Etsy. While it easily outstrips the similar NSA-focused Day We Fight Back, the Battle for the Net is not even close to SOPA levels. At this point, honestly, it’s not clear that anything ever will be. What is clear is that net neutrality has mobilized the internet community in a way few policy issues can. Wheeler’s draft has drawn more comments to the FCC than any docket in the agency’s history. ""Your phone is the internet, and your appointments are the internet, and your friends are the internet."" ""Last time we did this fight in 2010, and before that, the internet was a place you went to read articles, listen to music. It was sort of a media platform,"" says Ammori. ""Now it’s become a platform for almost everything in our economy."" In a way, we feel it less, and that makes it more important than ever. ""The internet is increasingly background, just this mesh that holds everything in your life together,"" says Savage. ""The issue becomes more personal every year. Theoretically in 2005, it might be like ‘This place I go for this and this and this may suck a little more.’ But now that your phone is the internet, and your appointments are the internet, and your friends are the internet, and everything is the internet, this kind of legislation would have a deeper impact on your everyday life.""

The mapping program was previously detailed in The New York Times, so in their reports, the two publications hone in on providers that have apparently been penetrated as part of this program in Germany, including the large operator Deutsche Telekom (notably, though, Deutsche Telekom says that it has detected no evidence of surveillance).  ""You could manipulate links, turn them off or on, change bandwidth."" But one company that The Intercept spoke with did acknowledge the surveillance — and it was deeply concerned to have heard of it. In a short documentary, filmmakers Katy Scoggin and Laura Poitras capture a meeting between an Intercept journalist and staff of Stellar, a satellite communications firm, as the firm is presented with evidence that it's been the subject of GCHQ surveillance. The surveillance comes as part of the internet mapping program, known as Treasure Map, but Stellar's engineers point out with great concern that the government's access could allow them to do quite a bit more — including shut off internet access to various customers its client serves in Africa. Of course, the accessing of Deutsche Telekom's networks could be a far bigger deal — should the documents in fact be accurate — but it appears to be unclear exactly how much these intelligence agencies actually have access to. The provider says it serves 143 million mobile customers and 17 million broadband lines, and Der Spiegel speculates that GCHQ's documents are implying that the agency could potentially have gained the ability to monitor data sent over all of these. That seems to be a fairly loose inference for now, though, and isn't the focus of these documents. The documents are also undated, so it's unknown when the agencies say they had access.

The leader denies it, but Snowden keeps pushing, with more documents and increasingly specific accusations. Pretty soon, the public wants answers and his political opponents start to use the leaks against him, even as the nation's spy agencies refuse to give up the goods. It's an unusually heated fight This week, it's happening in New Zealand, where Prime Minister John Key is fending off accusations of maintaining a massive metadata surveillance system in the run-up to the country's general elections on Saturday. Key denies spying on any New Zealand citizens, but The Intercept has extensive documents detailing the program, which contains many of the same email and phone surveillance measures that were revealed in America, something Key had specifically denied. In a rare editorial, Snowden says outright that Key lied about the existence of the programs. It's an unusually heated fight, even for Snowden, and thanks to the nation's central place in the internet cables of the South Pacific, it's a fight that could have major implications outside of New Zealand. While it's not a large country, a significant quantity of the Pacific’s data traffic passes through New Zealand, thanks to two data cables that come ashore on the northern island, including the trans-Pacific Southern Cross cable. That makes it ideally situated to help the NSA monitor the world’s web traffic. While the NSA and GCHQ tap into European and Middle Eastern web traffic from a base in Cyprus, New Zealand is perfectly placed to listen in on the South Pacific. It’s also been one of the NSA’s closest historical allies, thanks to its longtime membership in the intelligence alliance known as The Five Eyes. Along with the UK, Canada and Australia, New Zealand has played a major role in secretly aiding the NSA’s data collection outside US borders. New Zealand sits at the center of many of the Pacific's data cables After the Snowden leaks, however, that collaboration is now public — and many in New Zealand are raising doubts about how useful it has been for the country at large. The Five Eyes partnership has been useful and prestigious for New Zealand's spies, but it's unclear how much it has benefited the country's citizens. If the country decides to oust Key in favor of a less surveillance-friendly government, the NSA's cable-tapping efforts in the South Pacific might face a real roadblock. It wouldn't be a disastrous blow. Between Hawaii, Guam, and Australia, the US would have plenty of other places to listen in on the same web traffic. But it would be among the most tangible blowback the NSA has seen so far, and if similar efforts take off in Cyprus and beyond, it could mean real problems for the NSA's global surveillance systems. As a result, Snowden, Glenn Greenwald and Wikileaks' Julian Assange are all lobbying hard to make surveillance a key issue in the upcoming election. Greenwald attended a press conference at the Auckland town hall on Monday, along with MegaUpload founder Kim Dotcom and Laila Harre, the leader of the country's Internet Party. (Snowden and Assange appeared through video links.) Key had previously promised to resign if the nation's spy agency was found to have conducted mass surveillance on New Zealand’s citizens, but his critics say that, as in the US, such a far-reaching database would inevitably pick up conversations involving local citizens. It’s still unclear how the issue will play out in the election. More than half of New Zealanders say they are concerned about government surveillance, although Key is still leading in the race according to recent polls. In the meantime, it's a sign that the NSA's critics aren't shying away from any fights — even if those fights are happening halfway around the world.",0.6330035755915249,0.36699642440847513,0.8566980504520131,652,5.0598159509202452,364,6.1703296703296706,0,0,"US & World, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Forstall has lain incredibly low since his stint at Apple, reportedly advising startups in Silicon Valley, and rather humorously having his Apple corporate headshot appear in multiple advertisements for The City College of New York. Then, in April, two strange things happened: leaked emails from the Sony Pictures hack that were published by Wikileaks pegged Forstall as an investor and advisor in Snapchat (something he would not confirm to the Journal); the next day, Forstall emerged as a co-producer with his wife on Fun Home, a Broadway musical, in his first Tweet in five years of having a Twitter account: I'm thrilled to be co-producing the Broadway musical Fun Home http://t.co/PqrKKZGcxY opening this Sunday. Bravo to the phenomenal team!  Forstall's ousting from Apple stemmed from him butting heads with others on Apple's executive team, prompting the company to promote ""increased collaboration"" as the tagline upon its news of his departure. At the time, sources told The Verge the issue came to a head upon Forstall's refusal to sign an apology to the company's customers over the roughness of Apple Maps. When the software was first released under Forstall's leadership, it had numerous issues, including things that developers had warned the company about several times ahead of its public debut. That apology was ultimately signed by Apple CEO Tim Cook, alongside a laundry list of maps apps from other companies. It's unclear how much the Forstalls have put into the production of Fun Home.

Last week, I told you that Grey Worm died in the arms of (the actually dead) Barristan Selmy, in what I thought was a pretty heroic standoff against a bunch of Sons of the Harpy (but which I have been told, both by Daenerys and the commenters, was an inglorious slaughter in an alleyway. I dunno, Benioff and Weiss, maybe next time don't pick such a strikingly lit alley filled with such cool looking assailants!) So when I saw GDub's perfect, gleaming, hairless chest rising and falling, as all-purpose concerned onlooker Missandei looked on concernedly, I knew the first order of business this week would be to reverse at least part of last week's impressive Harpy pointage (-30) and award our guy a special bonus for Not Being Dead. (+10) +10 to Grey Worm for Not Being Dead With that out of the way, Grey Worm was free to finally get some chaste lip contact on with Missandei (+5 each) and we're free to discuss the rest of the episode, which was frankly a lot more interesting. This week was a bit strange from a scoring standpoint — a lot of folks were on bye weeks, with just 21 players/teams in play (a new low for the season), and those who were around were not exactly lopping off heads. But it still managed to be the kind of episode where I found myself checking how many minutes were left, not because it felt like it was dragging, but because I didn't want it to end. I've found that Game of Thrones' more focused episodes tend to have this effect, but perhaps the joke is on yours truly, the Gamemaster general, for trying to quantify the quality of a season with kills and one-liners. That does work a lot of the time, and don't think for a second I'm about to abandon this schtick, but a lot of season five has been about not what our players do, but what they see. When you think about the characters who have made the biggest impact this season, it's those via whom the world of the show is expanding.   People keep showing Sansa horrible stuff Sometimes that's in a literal way, as with Jaime and Bronn in Dorne, but sometimes its in a more personal way. We're getting to know the Boltons through Sansa Stark — who along with us is getting a clearer view of just what kind of fucked-up family she's marrying into. Bolton family dinners look like a real treat as is, imagine if the dehumanized murderer of your little brothers (so far as she and most of Westeros knows) showed up to pour the wine. Remember at the end of Season One, when Joffrey proudly showed Sansa her father's head on a spike outside the Red Keep? That's more or less been her arc over the last several years: people keep showing her horrible stuff and all she can do is nod and smile. At least now we have the promise that she might finally do something about it. The Hound stopped her from pushing Joffrey over the ledge back in King's Landing, but she might be able to do something worse to Ramsay Snow on their wedding night. Maybe his lowborn sidepiece Miranda will want to join in. Oh right, Miranda — you remember her, right? Ramsay's partner in crime when it comes to hunting humans for sport and other totally chill and normal Bolton pastimes? Well, they're still very into rending each other's flesh, though Miranda is being reminded of her place as the kennel master's daughter now that Ramsay is no longer a bastard. She gets to see his pasty Snow-butt on the regs (+15) and he still gets to do aggressive serial-killer sex with her (+15) but he's never going to marry her. For the time being that appears to be enough for her, provided she gets to torment Sansa with scary dogs and human livestock every now and then. Even the Boltons' mistresses are desperate to prove how edgy they are (but Wanda seems pretty nice. And she's expecting! Congrats!)   Ramsay needs to get leeched, stat At first it seems like the new baby will mark the end of Ramsay's I'm-Not-A-Bastard victory lap, but it's really just Roose Bolton's test to see how committed Ramsay is to his new official family, i.e. can he take a break from skinning defenseless humans and do some real military work defending Winterfell from Stannis' army? I don't really care what the answer is, I'm already imagining lots of creative battle deaths for Ramsay. Part of me really hopes Melisandre gets to him first. Dude needs to get leeched, stat. Sansa once again did not do much this week, but in keeping with the seeing-not-doing theme, she's certainly party to a lot of the most interesting developments this season. With the throne proper more or less paralyzed in the wake of Tywin's death, the machinations going down in Winterfell and the Wall are suddenly more important than ever. Likewise, Shireen Baratheon — also much more of an observer than a actor so far — gets my vote for most potential, and certainly a character whose importance seems to be increasing rather than diminishing. She's even going to Winterfell! Why? Apparently Stannis doesn't want her hanging around the wall with a bunch of ""killers and rapists."" Has he met the Boltons?   Up until tonight, Shireen was also the only living character we knew of with Greyscale, a disease about which we've learned quite a bit more lately. Last night we got to see a few much more advanced cases of it during Jorah and Tyrion's little shortcut through Valyria. That's right, Valyria! Essos' hottest ghost territory! From the looks of it, Valyria has everything: world class steel, gargantuan ruins, a vaping sea, dragons, something fun called The Doom, and more stone men than you can shake a stick at (which is literally, I think, how Jorah was fighting them off — +20 to him for picking off two.) I would dock Jorah points for contracting Greyscale, because it seems like a real bummer — but it's also the most interesting thing that's happened to him in a while. (""Long sullen silences and the occasional punch in the face. The Mormont Way."" — there's your weekly +5 for sass, Tyrion.) So for right now let's call it neutral. I'm just glad the poor guy has a plot. Contracting Greyscale is the most interesting thing that's happened to Jorah in a while Tyrion's another character who's seeing a lot of stuff, and while I presume it will culminate in him doing something (hopefully) awesome once he reaches Meereen, the darkride through Essos' primeval world is pretty entertaining for now. But let's move on to Daenerys, who began and ended the episode with some pretty powerful moments. Let's not forget that for all the character-level shufflings and strategizing, we started off this episode with a dude getting torched and then ripped apart by dragons. (+10 to Dragons.) It was a nice bit of shock and awe, right out of Dany's established playbook during her tenure in the Slaver's Bay, but one's palm also couldn't help but meet one's face — oh lord, here she goes again, alienating the people she's supposedly saving. Granted, she was a little hot under the collar after the murder of her buddy Barristan. But then, miraculously, she regrouped, got some counsel from her newly boo'd up confidante Missandei, and made a genius reversal: SHE'LL REOPEN THE FIGHTING PITS! AND! SHE'LL MAKE HIZDAHR ZO LORAQ HER BRIDE!!   HIZDAHR!!   ZO LORAQ!! (via Tumblr of Thrones) Daenerys hasn't spent much time in Westeros, but she appears to have come to the same conclusion all the savviest highborn over there have: the best way to secure an alliance — and often, achieve a measure of peace — is with a wedding. And the one-two punch of the fighting pits and making Hizdahr the Stepfather of Dragons is a great tip of the hat to the previous Powers that Be that really costs her little to nothing. That she announced this marriage to him while he was on his knees in a prison cell has got to be one of the all-time best Daenerys Targaryen executive decisions of all time. One of the all-time best Daenerys Targaryen executive decisions of all time    And then I realized that, as important as engagements and marriages are, we still don't have any pointage value for them. I resisted awarding points to Ramsay and Sansa for their engagement a couple weeks back because it seemed like such a lose-lose proposition, but an engagement is also a recipe for screen time, drama, and power moves. So just as Dany reinstated the Fighting Pits, I'm opening the Marriage Pits, with a +10 point value for getting engaged and a +20 value for actually saying your vows in the sight of the Seven (or whatever god you kneel to.) Points will be awarded retroactively to Ramsay, Sansa, Tommen and Margaery, indeed some of the most happy and powerful characters on Game of Thrones. Love is in the air! Now let's just hope the surviving Zo Loraq family picks any wedding colors besides red or purple.

Either option has its pros and cons: on-ear headphones are smaller, more portable, and can make for a better seal depending on the shape of your ears, while over-ear headphones generally have more presence, better bass response, and can be more comfortable to wear. The new t402v headphones from Torque are different, however, as they don't force you to choose which type of headphone you want when you buy them. The t402v headphones can actually switch between on-ear and over-ear modes with just a swap of the earcups. The earcups are magnetically attached to the headphones, and can be popped off and switched around at will. The t402v come with both on-ear and over-ear cups, so you can use the on-ear ones when on the go and switch to the over-ear cups when using them at home. You can also change the sound profile of the headphones by rotating the cups on their mounts. Four modes are available, each with progressively less bass response for various styles of music or personal preferences. It's a similar system to Torque's in-ear headphones that let you change the valves to alter their sound profiles. The $400 t402v have a padded headband and metal mounts and use 40mm speaker drivers. They aren't wireless, but they do come with a lengthy cable that includes a microphone and remote. I've had a chance to use the t402v for a few weeks and they are largely what you might expect from headphones in this price range. The sound is crisp and clear, and even in the bassiest profile mode, the low-end is never overwhelming. I usually prefer over-ear styles of headphones, but the on-ear cups for the t402v provided a better seal and better sound blocking than the over-ear cups. They also didn't smush my ears uncomfortably like other on-ear headphones I've used. The over-ear cups are quite large, and tend to pop off of their mounts very easily. I would not recommend using them on the go. You can even use an on-ear cup on one side with an over-ear cup on the other, but the result is rather uncomfortable and ridiculous looking. Don't do this. Torque says it will bring the t402v to market by October of this year.

With an update rolling out today for iOS and Android, you are no longer required to hold a finger down to view snaps and Stories. Watching is now triggered by a single tap on the snap or Story to make it begin playing — you can still skip through by tapping a finger on the screen. Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel strongly hinted at this change in May at the Code Conference, stating that, ""It's just kind of annoying to hold your finger there for so long."" From inception, snaps have always been viewed by placing a finger on the screen and holding it there; lifting it up would immediately stop the playback. Now if you want to stop watching a Story, you can drag your finger down anywhere on the screen and it'll close. This action has more or less become a common method of dismissing media in apps — think photos on Twitter, Facebook videos, and Snapchat's own Discover. Watching snaps without holding a finger down feels more natural, but definitely removes some of the magic that originally made the app feel special. No more holding your finger down on the screen Aside from this core change, Snapchat is adding two new ways to add friends. The first is an ""add nearby"" feature, which allows you to add people that are — you guessed it — nearby. A new option in the Add Friends menu, called Add Nearby, generates a list of everyone in the vicinity who are also in that menu. Adding friends is done by tapping their username inside this menu. Your Snapchat username will only show up in the Add Nearby menu if you are in fact inside that menu within the app — it isn't constantly scanning / broadcasting your location. The second new way to add friends: you can use images of Snapchat QR codes in your camera roll to add friends. For most of Snapchat's life, adding friends was done manually, i.e. by typing in a username. In January of this year, Snapchat introduced Snapcodes — or as we like to call them, BooR codes (pronounced ""boo-arr"") — which, when scanned with the Snapchat camera, seamlessly adds that person as a friend. Now, say you're browsing Twitter or Instagram on mobile and you see a BooR code you'd like to add; screenshot it, open Snapchat, and choose ""add by Snapcode."" Snapchat continues pushing its QR codes Snapchat is also adding one more fun change in this update: it's letting you customize your BooR code right inside the app. Tapping the ghost on the QR code will open the front camera and snap a burst of five shots — think of a photo booth. Now, when you pull your info page down to share your QR code with a friend, an animation of your delightful face will be on loop. It doesn't really serve a functional purpose aside from being a fun way to add flavor to your BooR code without using a computer. Sadly, you cannot export it as a GIF or video file. You can export the first frame as a still image, however. Today's Snapchat update brings fundamental changes to the way snaps are consumed. This will come as a surprise to many — part of what originally made Snapchat special was its utilization of tap-and-hold. Holding a finger down to watch snaps comes with a strong sense of active engagement. Now that it's going away, it remains to be seen what'll happen — will people pay less attention to snaps now that a finger doesn't have to be on the screen? Will people watch longer stories now that they can do so hands-free? If one thing's for sure though, it's that we finally get to watch snaps without obstruction. And Evan is right — it is kind of annoying to hold your thumb down.",0.7609244817723401,0.23907551822765993,0.16132748203765523,658,4.5015197568389054,339,5.5044247787610621,1,0,"Apps, Tech, Exclusive",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Everything from the setup process (I kept hitting ""more artists"" until I couldn't anymore) through the entire user interface left me impressed yesterday. Apple has managed to reinvent its Music app by stuffing a subscription music service inside it — without making it all hopelessly confusing. Is there a learning curve? Oh yeah. But once you get it, you get it. And aside from the occasional, laugh-worthy miss, the recommendations I'm seeing in the For You section are on point. Still, there's one fundamental problem with Apple Music that's crippling its potential for me and keeping it from becoming my one and only music destination — exactly the thing Apple wants it to be. It's the way the service heavily leans on iCloud. Or more specifically, ""iCloud Music Library."" If you've not yet come across this option, broadly speaking it's a rebranded version of iTunes Match that comes included with Apple Music's $9.99 monthly fee. Flip it on, and Apple will scan your entire iTunes library and compare it with its own catalog. The goal is to make your whole music collection available across devices via iCloud. Any tracks that Apple successfully matches with iTunes show up instantly, and those that aren't automatically get uploaded. Once everything's done, you can stream music on your iPhone or iPad without taking up valuable storage, saving that space for more apps or photos and videos.  A sample post from Apple's support forums. At least, that's the idea. In reality, iTunes Match has been one of Apple's more flawed cloud services for a few years now. Ever since it rolled out, users have complained about several key things. For one, it's just not very good at the matching process. iTunes will mistakenly swap explicit songs for censored takes or disregard mono recordings in favor of stereo versions. Or it'll inexplicably match only certain songs from an album and upload the other tracks. Some of these issues, like censored tracks, have improved with time. But turning on iTunes Match (and thus iCloud Music Library) is still a huge gamble for people who are meticulous about their music library. Google Music has a similar matching mechanism, but Google mercifully includes a ""Fix incorrect match"" option that uploads the file from your PC or Mac to ensure you're hearing the right thing. I don't have to worry about my mono Beatles albums suddenly going stereo. iTunes Match can mess with your library, and now it's a huge piece of Apple Music A day after Apple Music's launch, people are already reporting that iCloud and iTunes have brought chaos to their music collections with incorrect album artwork and duplicated songs. There’s already a lengthy Apple support forum thread on the problems. Even if you've already got cover art linked to songs in your library, Apple will frequently ignore the work you've put in and just use whatever seems like the best fit from iTunes. And it's often wrong. This is another problem that Google shares with Apple, and another where Google makes it easier to fix mistakes. But back to the main point: many people won't mind the roll-the-dice nature of iCloud Music Library — especially if you've ditched the traditional ""music library"" and gone all in on streaming services. But some of us definitely do. My iTunes library is comprised entirely of Apple Lossless tracks, carefully tagged with artist info and high-resolution artwork that looks great on my iPhone. If I turn on iCloud Music Library, I'm worried that all of that will instantly be blown up — and this stuff takes hours of monotonous work to fix. It's hugely disappointing because I love Apple's concept and it'd be great to have all of my music with me at 256 kbps quality while keeping the lossless files safe on my primary computer.   As I alluded to earlier, this approach kills the potential of Apple Music for me. If you're unwilling to trust iCloud, you don't get the full feature set. Want to download any of those great, curated playlists for offline playback? Sorry, iCloud Music Library must be turned on first. If you want to enjoy this service's most convenient features, there's no way of telling Apple ""put a wall between my iTunes library and Apple Music."" In fairness, that makes total sense, since such granular options could get confusing in a hurry. I'm not flipping the switch until there are clear signs of improvement So the real answer is this: Apple, please make iTunes Match and iCloud Music Library better. No one is saying figuring this stuff out is easy, but it needs to be more reliable. Make it easier to fix the occasional screw-ups — or give users the ability to manually upload songs like Google does. (It's possible to upload 50,000 of your own songs to Google Music for free.) If and when that happens, I'll happily make Apple Music my go-to music app. Everything else Apple has here is pretty great. But for now I'll keep my Spotify subscription going. It's just way easier to save music offline without worrying about iCloud mucking up the library I've sunk years into. This forced link between Apple Music and iCloud Music Library just seems unnecessary. @keybuk Tracks matched with iTunes Match are still DRM-free. An Apple Music-only account will match tracks too, but with DRM versions.  But there may be an explanation, and if true, it's an ugly one: DRM. A troubling report today from Kirk McElhearn claims that Apple is applying DRM to every track contained in iCloud Music Library — even your own songs. So if you upload regular old MP3s to iCloud, delete them from your PC or Mac and then redownload, they'll be DRMed files. This differs from the DRM-free nature of iTunes Match and is a confounding decision from a company whose co-founder went to war with the music industry over the very principle of DRM. We've reached out to confirmation on this. So for the next three months, I'll strictly be streaming music with Apple Music. At least that part's pretty great.",0.5058035569544884,0.4941964430455116,0.1417581558658737,1036,4.83976833976834,537,5.8435754189944138,1,4,"Apple, Tech, Editorial",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Radiohead's In Rainbows as well as Yorke's album with Atoms for Peace are also streaming through Apple, despite being pulled elsewhere. It's a surprising sight, as Yorke has been highly critical of how streaming services pay musicians. ""Make no mistake new artists you discover on Spotify will no get paid [sic],"" Yorke tweeted in 2013. ""Meanwhile shareholders will shortly being rolling in it.""  Another musician sides with Apple After some controversy, Apple is now paying artists for streams during its streaming service's free trial. It's also supposed to be paying a very small amount more in royalties than Spotify. More than likely, that isn't what's attracting musicians. Ad-supported streaming brings in far less money than a paid subscription, and Apple Music is all about getting people to pay for streaming, rather than letting them listen for free like Spotify. Of course, that doesn't necessarily make for a better streaming service, but it does make for better music industry revenue. The effect of Yorke's decision is that Apple Music ends up with yet another de facto exclusive. Same goes for Taylor Swift's 1989, which isn't contractually exclusive to Apple, but is in effect a streaming exclusive for now, as she hasn't put it up anywhere else. Apple Music is also the only streaming service with Dr. Dre's The Chronic, although there are some obvious reasons for that.

But while the modem makes those speeds possible, they still can't happen without the right support from carriers — and in most areas of the world, you still aren't going to get anything like those speeds. That's because those speeds rely on carriers supporting LTE Advanced, which by and large hasn't rolled out.  Even if your phone isn't faster now, it could be later LTE Advanced is already available in some areas, including Korea. AT&T has also begun supporting it in some major US cities, like New York and San Francisco, but it's unclear how widespread the service is. In practice, LTE Advanced speeds are also unlikely to match the high theoretical capabilities that the standard and these chips support. Still, it's going to make your LTE service faster to some extent, and Apple's inclusion of a new chip will future-proof the next iPhone for whenever support for this standard widely rolls out. Other smartphones, including some Galaxy phones, already include this Qualcomm chip or other support for these faster speeds. Update: Read the iPhone 6S review. There are other possible advantages of Apple switching over to this new LTE modem. 9to5Mac notes that it's supposed to be more power efficient, which could result in improved battery life on the next iPhone. It's also a bit smaller, and 9to5Mac suggests that Apple may make the phone's entire motherboard tinier so that a slightly larger battery can be included in the phone. However, 9to5Mac also reports that the next iPhone is unlikely to have any noticeable design changes from the current model, so the changes would likely be minor. Altogether, it's possible that those will have an impact on battery life — particularly in combination with the power saving feature being built into iOS 9 — but as Phil Schiller has suggested, Apple is pretty happy with where battery life is already at.",0.4614056772057427,0.5385943227942573,0.19424196182947548,376,4.8643617021276597,217,5.5207373271889404,0,0,"Apple, Mobile, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's remained largely intact for more than 500 years, but tiny cracks in its ankles may threaten its stability, according to recent findings from Italy's National Research Council (CNR), published in the Journal of Cultural Heritage. Experts have long said that David is at risk of collapsing due to the poor-quality marble that Michelangelo used, as well as its precarious pose. Because of these structural problems, an earthquake or even vibrations from nearby construction could cause it to fall. To test its stability, researchers from CNR and the University of Florence created small plaster replicas of the sculpture and exposed them to forces stronger than gravity inside a centrifuge. Based on their results, they believe the ankle micro-fractures developed after years of outdoor exposure in a public square, where it leaned forward at an angle of about five degrees. David was put on public display outside a Florentine government building in 1504, when it was first unveiled, before being moved inside the Accademia Gallery in 1873.

What Modern Farmer didn't note, however, is that doctors regularly discourage people with ulcers from drinking cow's milk because it actually makes ulcers worse. The moose at Sumarokovo Moose Farm in Kostroma Oblast roam freely most of the year, but when the calving season comes around, farm workers lure them into pens using buckets of oats. There, the female moose give birth and about a week later, workers begin harvesting their milk. The animals produce as much as 1.5 gallons of salty, acidic milk each day. Once collected, the milk is ingested by patients at the Ivan Susanin Sanatorium — an alternative therapy facility for people with gastrointestinal ailments — to treat a plethora of health problems, including peptic ulcers. Cow's milk makes ulcers worse Moose milk, reports Modern Farmer, is high in essential amino acids and lypozyme, an enzyme that kills ulcer-causing bacteria. This might be why the Russian farmers believe that it helps cure ulcers. Unfortunately, few studies have been done on this mammal's milk, let alone its medicinal properties, so the claim is hard to verify. But given what we know about cow's milk and ulcers, it's possible that what they are mistaking for ""a cure"" is actually just the temporary relief that is afforded by coating the stomach lining with milk. Once that effect wears off, cow's milk actually prompts the stomach to produce even more acid than it normally does. This makes ulcers more painful, and often makes them worse. The United Nations last year spoke out in favor of efforts to exploit alternative sources of milk — sources such as camels, moose, and deer — following a report in which economists estimated that global milk consumption was likely to increase by 25 percent by 2025. But the Russian farm isn't producing nearly enough milk to turn this endeavor into a commercially viable business. Instead, the people who work on the farm told Modern Farmer that they are working on conservation and educating the public — in addition to continuing their efforts to ensure that the farm is ""the most stable moose-milk provider for medication in Russia.""",0.31723673239280703,0.682763267607193,0.8693686492908106,373,5.0857908847184987,233,5.8712446351931327,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In a 6-2 ruling handed down Tuesday, the court upheld an EPA regulation that requires 28 states to cut emissions from coal-burning plants that pollute the air in downwind states. The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule was met with lawsuits from power companies and more than a dozen states when it was implemented in 2011, and was blocked by a federal appeals court in 2012. The Supreme Court has now reversed that decision, ruling that the EPA has the authority, under the Clean Air Act, to impose emissions reductions in upwind states. The EPA argued that the rule would improve air quality in downwind states, preventing more than 30,000 premature deaths and other illnesses. The EPA's regulations focus on nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions, which have been linked to cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. The White House has made cutting emissions from coal-burning power plants a cornerstone of its environmental agenda. Opponents say the EPA infringed on states' rights Power companies and some upwind states contested the rule, arguing that it infringes on states' rights. Texas, Ohio, and 12 other states believed it was their responsibility to determine their respective effects on pollution levels in downwind states, and that the EPA declined to work cooperatively on the issue. They also criticized the EPA's methodology for determining the appropriate levels of reduced emissions, claiming that some states were forced to cut more than their fair share, but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg sided with the EPA, writing that the complexities of the situation ""are not so simple."" ""Most upwind states contribute to pollution to multiple downwind states in varying amounts,"" Ginsberg wrote on behalf of the majority opinion. Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas argued in dissent, while Justice Samuel Alito was recused. The EPA estimates that its rules would impose annual costs of about $800 million on power companies, compared to the $1.6 billion in annual expenditures under current rules, implemented under the George W. Bush administration in 2005. The federal agency says these costs will be balanced in the long-run by greater savings in healthcare expenses, which it estimated to be in the hundreds of billions. Experts say the ruling could have implications for future regulations, making it more difficult to mount legal challenges to federal air quality acts. Later this year, the EPA will announce plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions under new Clean Air Act rules. ""It’s a big win for the EPA, and not just because it has to do with this rule,"" said Jody Freeman, director of Harvard's environmental law program, told the New York Times.

But the ruling Communist Party has changed its tune in recent months, acknowledging the extent of its pollution crisis, and taking aggressive action to curtail it. Last week, the government passed sweeping amendments to its environmental protection laws — the first changes in 25 years — imposing tougher penalties for polluters and making it easier for whistleblowers and advocates to report polluting companies. When it goes into effect next January, the law will establish ""environmental protection as the country's basic policy."" The amendments passed this month mark the latest in a series of recent moves to curb pollution in China, where environmental concerns have become a hot political issue. Late last year, the government announced its first national plan to combat climate change, and it has already committed $280 billion to cleaning its air. In March, Premier Li Keqiang said China will ""declare war"" on pollution, describing the country's smog problems as ""nature's red-light warning against inefficient and blind development."" A ""red-light warning"" Rapid industrialization and a burgeoning middle class have strained resources in China, with devastating effects on its air, land, and waterways. Coal-burning plants have fueled regular smog crises in some parts of the country, and widespread pollution has put extra pressure on limited water supplies. Earlier this month, the government announced that one-fifth of its farmland is contaminated by pollutants like cadmium and arsenic. And despite world-leading investments in renewable energy, China continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels to meet its energy needs: it remains the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, and accounts for about one-third of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Experts are cautiously optimistic about the revised legislation, describing it as an encouraging sign that the country is getting serious about environmental stewardship. Although China has announced several initiatives to tackle pollution in the past, few have been implemented, and the government has long been reluctant to acknowledge the extent of the damage. Its efforts have been especially hindered by weak central oversight from the federal Ministry of Environmental Protection, as well as vested industrial interests that are intrinsically linked with local governments, weakening incentives to implement change. The stiffer penalties announced last week could signal a transformation: executives of polluting companies can be detained for up to 15 days under the amended legislation, and local government leaders who cover up environmental abuses risk being demoted or fired. ""What's most exciting is that there are parts of it that are trying to give the Ministry teeth,"" says Jennifer Turner, director of the China Environment Forum at the Wilson Center. ""That's been a vital weakness in China's environmental enforcement for a long, long time."" ""People in China are unhappy because their health is being very immediately impacted."" The Chinese public has become more aware of the country's environmental crisis, and have begun voicing their concerns through both social media and public demonstrations. In late March, about 1,000 people demonstrated outside government buildings in the southern city of Maoming to protest plans to build a new chemical plant. Similar demonstrations sprouted elsewhere in the country, and hundreds of protests occurred last year, underscoring an ongoing and important shift in thinking on environmental issues. ""Up to 10 years ago people would say that pollution's part of the story — we endure it for economic growth,"" Turner says. ""And I would say in general now, you don't hear people saying that. People in China are unhappy because their health is being very immediately impacted."" A study published last year found that poor air quality led to 1.2 million premature deaths in 2010 alone, while carcinogenic contaminants found in Chinese soil have been linked to kidney damage and other diseases. Although China has made moves toward transparency, environmental issues remain sensitive for government censors. Earlier this year, the country censored a study that said the country's air problems have made some cities ""unsuitable for human habitation,"" and removed social media posts that questioned the government's response to a February smog crisis. As recently as 2012, officials claimed that China's air quality was actually improving, despite clear evidence to the contrary. ""They've taken the gloves off."" But the problems have become too glaring for even the Communist Party propaganda machine to ignore. When record-level smog blanketed Beijing last year, China's state-run media outlets didn't hesitate to criticize the government, questioning its growth model and calling for greater transparency on environmental data. ""They've taken the gloves off,"" Turner says of the Chinese media. ""They're not pulling any punches on any reporting on pollution."" Fear of wider unrest has spurred the government to take action, experts say, though there are economic considerations, as well. Beijing realizes it must transition to a more sustainable growth model — hence the enormous investments in renewable energy — but doesn't want to disrupt an economy that has blossomed on the strength of polluting industries. ""They're trying to rip out China's growth engine and replace it with a new one, a green one, while keeping the economy going ahead at 100 miles an hour,"" says Anna Snyder, China analyst at Rhodium Group, a New York-based consultancy. The amendments passed last week stand as the clearest sign yet that change is on the horizon, though it's not yet clear whether the government will be able to enforce them. Chinese leaders are no strangers to lofty rhetoric, Snyder notes, though seeing it through has proven more difficult. ""As ever, the language is incredibly exciting,"" she says. ""It's obvious that Chinese leaders know that environmental reform is a categorical imperative. But whether or not there is going to be the institutional capacity to uphold all these really high-minded reforms is unclear... Implementation is everything.""",0.49900000074869344,0.5009999992513066,0.8707463759586819,979,5.5454545454545459,544,6.663602941176471,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But researchers now say that a new surgical technique can enable the regeneration of some muscle after large amounts are lost in accidents or war injuries, offering a much improved path to recovery. The technique involves implanting a small biological scaffolding at the injury site and then entering patients into an aggressive physical therapy regimen, and researchers say that the initial results have led to quality of life improvements for all patients of the procedure.  ""We are very confident in the science behind it."" In a paper published today, five patients are reported to have successfully regrown muscle, with three of the five seeing at least a 25 percent functional improvement to the injured limb. In all cases, the patients had previously lost over half of their treated limb's muscle and were no longer seeing improvements through physical therapy. ""The problem of volumetric muscle loss is truly an area with an unmet clinical need,"" Stephen Badylak, a University of Pittsburgh researcher and corresponding author on the study, says on a call discussing the results. Areas of large muscle loss usually end up covered in scar tissue, rather than new muscle, limiting how far a patient can recover. Physical therapy and other surgeries can help to improve that, but Badylak calls the current options ""truly limited."" With their new surgical technique, however, Badylak say that surgeons can get cells to avoid turning into scar tissue — and start turning into muscle again. The process requires a pairing of surgery and physical therapy. In surgery, existing scar tissue is first removed from the injury site. A thin sheet of biological scaffolding — known as an extracellular matrix, in this case made from a pig's bladder — is then implanted in the area and attached to healthy tissue so that new stem cells can reach it. After surgery, the patients are then entered into an aggressive physical therapy regimen within one to two days. ""The cells get the idea."" As the scaffolding begins to degrade, cells receive a signal to come and attempt to rebuild it. By then placing the area under stress from physical therapy, the cells recognize that they should begin forming into muscle. ""The cells get the idea,"" Badylak says. ""They go, 'I get it. I'm supposed to line up this way, bear weight, contract, whatever.'"" The human trials build on earlier tests on rodents, which showed that the procedure could allow them to regrow muscle at severely injured portions of their hind limbs. The human trials provide a limited set of results, but the researchers believe in them. ""We recognize that this is a small number of patients that we have started with,"" Badylak says, ""but we are very confident in the science behind it."" The research was led by Brian Sicari and Peter Rubin at the University of Pittsburgh's McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine, and its results are being published today in Science Translational Medicine. All of the patients in the trial had an injured leg, with three of the five receiving their wounds in the military, two of which came from IEDs. It should be no surprise that there's interest in seeing what the new procedure can do to help those with military injuries. A portion of the research's funding — about $3 million over the past four or five years — even came from the Department of Defense. Researchers hope to avoid poor replication of their study And critically, Badylak says that the entire process is designed so that it ""can be utilized literally anywhere that a good surgery is available."" It won't be heading out to the field just yet though. The next step will be for the researchers behind this study to carefully train between three to five other institutions in the process so that they can properly attempt to recreate these results. Badylak paints this tentative step forward primarily as a precautionary measure to protect the integrity of the research: ""Frankly, the reason that we're doing this is because if someone reads this article and some surgeon out in the Great Plains decides that, 'You know, all I have to do is buy this stuff, put it into the site,' and they don't get the good results, we'll spend the next 10 years fighting in the literature back and forth about who's right and who's wrong."" If the method really is this effective, he has a point. But there's good reason that those debates happen and that doctors who are uninvolved with the original researchers will now be able to take a look at and review the methodology, trying it out themselves to determine whether its so-far limited results are repeatable. Regardless of who they come from, it's still going to take many more trials to see what the procedure is really capable of.",0.23824336857200773,0.7617566314279922,0.8559947936404431,818,4.8985330073349633,424,5.9386792452830193,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

AT&T's latest reply is to offer T-Mobile customers a $200 credit for every line that they switch over to its network. Though that credit can go toward any AT&T products or services, it's not about to cover the cost of a new iPhone: customers who want the credit will either have to buy a new phone at full price, activate a phone that they already own, or sign up for AT&T's Next early upgrade plan, which will have them buying full-price devices anyway.  An off-contract deal, just like T-Mobile In fact, two-year contracts aren't available at all as part of the deal. For T-Mobile customers who already own a phone outright, that can still make it a fine offer, as they should be used to off-contract pricing and payments already. With those limitations, the deal is a clear push by AT&T away from on-contract phones (and potentially onto the regular payments of Next). AT&T is also offering up to $250 to T-Mobile customers for trading in one of their existing smartphone. That's among the higher sums for carrier trade-ins, but it's far from the best deal smartphone owners could get if they shop around. The deal — which AT&T is advertising as a single offer of up to $450 — is only available for a limited time, and right now, AT&T isn't saying for how long. That may depend on what we see T-Mobile do at CES next week: it's been rumored that the carrier is working on a similar deal to what AT&T is launching today, and it's easy to see this as a preemptive response.

The seasoned veterans will bring their writing and editing talents (as well the entirety of the former All Things D staff) to the new business, which officially launches this evening. Swisher and Mossberg will also be continuing their successful conference business under the ""Code Conference"" moniker, and will kick off the first event in May of this year. It's a major change for Mossberg and Swisher, having been a long-standing part of the Wall Street Journal family. It's particularly notable that duo was able to bring every single member of its former team to the new venture — a testament to the group's loyalty. The current staff totals 23 employees, including respected reporters such as Ina Fried, Arik Hesseldahl, Peter Kafka, and Liz Gannes. A part-time staff of 12 will handle the conferences. The site and conference series will all be part of a new business called Revere Digital, the result of a partnership struck between Swisher and Mossberg, NBCUniversal News Group, and Windsor Media (an investment firm helmed by former Yahoo CEO Terry Semel), with the two writers holding a majority stake in the enterprise. The editorial staff of the site will also hold equity in the venture. In addition to a monetary investment in the business, Revere and NBC News have an operating agreement in place that will give the network and its associated news channels and sites access to Re/code's content and editorial talent. Though plans are still being worked out, NBC will not purely syndicate Re/code's content, nor rewrite it, and deputy managing editor John Paczkowski will work with NBC News to coordinate editorial strategies. Swisher and Mossberg aren't disclosing the monetary details of the deal, though previous rumors had placed the investment at somewhere around $10 to $15 million. According to Mossberg, there will be ""plenty of money to get this going, and to expand."" Swisher adds that the company is ""well funded, and it gives us the opportunity to add people, features, products, or conferences."" As far as content is concerned, Mossberg and Swisher say that Re/code will pick up exactly where All Things D left off, covering tech news in both the enterprise and consumer spaces, reviews of new devices and software, and original reporting on the media. The conference series will follow a similar theme, with the main event taking place in California every May, and smaller satellite events covering media and the mobile landscape throughout the year. In addition to the relationship with NBC News for video and TV appearances, CNBC will be Revere's partner for the live events. According to Swisher, there are plans for additional conferences, though nothing has been formalized.

As head of the FCC, Wheeler could use broadcast regulations to make use of the team name difficult, though doing so would likely initiate a battle and controversy of its own.

Are you planning on watching some movies tonight on Netflix? Or posting a photo to Tumblr? Or backing a crowdfunded project? You're going to see a lot of spinning wheels. As fall elections heat up and the FCC prepares to close the public comment period on its Open Internet proposal, a cluster of major sites and a number of more minor ones are urging visitors to contact Congress and the FCC and express support for reclassifying broadband internet under the ""common carrier"" rules that govern phone service and other utilities. This isn't the only net neutrality-related proposal on the table, but it's one that could successfully block internet service providers from providing ""fast lanes"" to sites that pay more, something FCC chair Tom Wheeler has considered allowing within ""commercially reasonable"" bounds. Supporters of that proposal argue that ISPs won't be able to degrade overall quality but can experiment with new tiers of service and business models. To people taking part in the day of action, though, speeding some services up could automatically relegate other parts of the internet to a ""slow lane"" where ISPs have less incentive to improve quality. And if the new net neutrality rules can't survive a legal challenge (as the last set couldn't), they could theoretically even degrade quality of service. Hence today's protest — if the web gets more data-intensive but internet quality is no longer evenly distributed, the idea goes, you could be seeing a lot more buffering. The widgets used by some of the sites come from net neutrality coalition Battle for the Net. Some ask you to sign a petition or send an email, while others will let you enter your phone number and directly connect you with a representative from your district, if you're in the US. The FCC is responsible for finalizing a net neutrality framework, but Congress can show support and potentially float legislation in support of the agency. House minority leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), for instance, has officially come out in favor of reclassifying broadband under common carrier rules. No matter what you do, these banners will be popping up until midnight tonight, when the day of action ends. If you're visiting Kickstarter's front page, you're learning about net neutrality, period. Only logged-in Tumblr users see this, but it's a cool, clever, and unmissable bit of graphic design. Netflix's widget is pretty small, but getting it on board was a huge win. Foursquare uses one of the basic widgets from Battle for the Net. Etsy dressed its widget up in a little frame, but did not put a bird on it. Vimeo has harnessed the power of bad video buffering to set your teeth on edge. Reddit is an important net neutrality player, but as with its NSA protest, it's not devoting a lot of screen space to it. Forget the banner ad up top. Urban Dictionary's front page is pretty clever.

According to The New Zealand Herald, New Zealand's Court of Appeal has ruled that police must provide copies of the data on all electronic devices that were confiscated in the raid on Dotcom's mansion ""as soon as reasonably practicable."" It's the latest decision in a protracted battle between Dotcom, New Zealand courts, and the US government, which is attempting to extradite him to face criminal copyright infringement charges. Dotcom is accused of running the now defunct Megaupload as a massive piracy ring, intentionally encouraging people to post copyrighted material. Dotcom, by contrast, has described Megaupload as a Dropbox-like cloud storage service that was not responsible for what individual users uploaded. Extradition hearings were supposed to be held this year, but they've since been delayed until February of 2015. The main questions at play have instead been whether the police raid on his property was carried out legally, and whether he can reclaim seized cars, money, and data. Dotcom hasn't been successful on the first two fronts, as the Court of Appeal decided in August that the US government didn't have to end a freeze on his assets. Dotcom's legal team has argued that hard drive data is necessary to build a defense, but they're also attempting to keep US law enforcement from getting direct access to encrypted information. A court has previously said that Dotcom shouldn't have to give passwords to the FBI, even if he grants access to local New Zealand legal teams. Now, there are actual provisions in place for getting the information decrypted. The Herald is oblique on this point, but per TorrentFreak's explanation, Dotcom will immediately get access to anything unencrypted, and more will follow when he gives his passwords to two police officers who are sworn to secrecy against the US government and others. Since his original arrest, Dotcom has attempted to build new careers in cloud storage, politics, and music (as seen above). In 2013 he launched ""Mega,"" touted as a more secure alternative to Dropbox or Google Drive. He has also founded the Internet Party, a New Zealand political group running candidates on a platform of privacy, expansion of internet access, and copyright reform among other positions.

It's also no secret that the show's cultural power hasn't been quite the same for well over a decade — it's been a long time since Kelly Clarkson broke out during the show's first season, in 2002.

You can find the company's products in so many places — even in Apple stores — that it's hard to remember that Olloclip got its start on Kickstarter. Now, four years later, Olloclip is going back to Kickstarter to launch a whole new product. It's called Olloclip Studio, and it's a modular iPhone case system meant to enhance your mobile photography experience. The Studio system starts with a more ruggedized version of the ""Ollocase,"" the company's case for iPhones 6 and 6 Plus that allows you to quickly attach lenses. But on the back of the new case you'll find a rather ingenious rail system. The carefully molded plastic lets you quickly attach and position all the things that come with the Studio's accessory kit, and it does that without adding any bulk to the case. Olloclip Studio looks like a great option under $100 for mobile photos and videos Included in the accessory kit is a ""finger grip,"" two different tripod mounts (for portrait or landscape), two ""cold-shoe"" adapters for attaching a shotgun microphone or a light, and a kickstand. The finger grip is the most interesting feature, and it works whether you're holding your phone in portrait or landscape. It consists of two curved strips of plastic that arch out from the back of the case, and it snaps right onto the rail on the Studio case. If you're holding your phone in landscape mode, you can slide your fingers underneath the plastic. If you're holding it upright, there's a groove created by the plastic that you can rest your index finger in.           It looks a little goofy, but I tried the same 3D-printed model featured in Olloclip's new Kickstarter when I met with them in New York City last week. Not only is the finger grip surprisingly comfortable, but it eliminates the inherent worry that usually comes with grabbing a slippery iPhone at its edges. The Studio's finger grip affords you more security at arm's length than just about anything, save for a selfie stick. On Olloclip's Kickstarter, which went live this morning, you can get the Studio case with just a kickstand for a pledge of $35. A pledge of $60 will get you the case and the whole accessory kit. Commit to pledge levels higher than that, and Olloclip will throw in some of its various lens clips. The rise of the selfie is real, and selfie sticks have grown so popular that they're being banned at places like Disney World. As that popularity escalates, more and more people — independent journalists, kids, dads — are using their phones to capture unique content. The Olloclip Studio is an attempt at creating an all-in-one solution for these kinds of people, all for well under $100. Is there enough demand for such a particular idea? We'll find out when the crowdfunding campaign ends next month.

Plenty of people reward themselves after a long day with a few minutes poking at their phone, and that's more or less how my love of baseball works. I open the MLB.tv app, load the subscription that I debatably paid too much for, and stream the game. I can watch the Kansas City broadcast, or the broadcast of our opponent, or if I prefer, I can listen to either team's local radio stations or the coverage en Español. Following my team is easy — because I don't live in Kansas City. All regular season games are subject to a blackout policy for local ball clubs on MLB.tv. Because I live in Texas, I can't watch the Rangers (an act of mercy) or the Astros. Due to contracts and exchanges of large sums of money that preceded the creation of streaming services, the MLB and its local partners in each city have agreed on your behalf that the best and only way for you to watch the nearby teams is on television broadcasts. Following Kansas City baseball is easy — because I don't live in Kansas City My friends in KC need to be seated in front of their cable-connected televisions for most Royals game, but because I live in a different state, my wife and I can watch Alex Gordon make this catch while waiting for a table at a busy restaurant. It makes no sense, and it is the norm for enjoying the most popular type of live television. I also have a NFL Sunday Ticket account, which I'm grandfathered into because I used to live in an apartment in New York City that didn't have access to Direct TV, allowing me to purchase the stand-alone option for the NFL subscription service. And like MLB.tv, I'm only able to watch the Kansas City Chiefs on the app when I'm a safe distance from Kansas City. MLB.tv came under legal trouble earlier this year, and that may be the only way things change. Teams make millions of partnerships with regional broadcast partners, and the MLB makes money by the bus load from fans willing to pay the subscription and find workarounds that break the platform's terms of service. Legal trouble may be the only reason things change One other workaround exists, which is more than likely the failsafe switch should the MLB's legal troubles become too serious: the MLB could cooperate with cable providers, allowing MLB.tv subscribers to prove they also pay for the cable that furnishes the local team's partner, trigger local ads within the app, and count the app viewers so that the local provider can sell against them to their ad buyers. That's absurd — like so many online television subscription services — because at the end of the day, you're required proof that you pay for cable just so you can watch something that has nothing to do with your cable subscription. So we're left considering the MLB.tv, arguably the best and most forward-looking live sports streaming service on the internet, allowing fans to watch games how they want and when they want, but not where they want. Because it's like the great athletes say, ""Don't do it for yourself. Don't do it for the fans. Do it for the contractually agreed upon local broadcasting partnerships.""

In a statement commemorating National Autism Awareness Month, the FDA noted a handful of medications that it has previously approved for use in autism treatment, as well as therapies to help specific symptoms. But health fraud coordinator Gary Coody said that a number of companies have been told to stop making misleading claims or face legal action. Of the five ""treatments"" the FDA cites, some have legitimate medical uses — they just haven't been shown to help autism. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, for instance, uses a pressurized chamber to deliver high levels of oxygen to a patient. It's an accepted treatment for decompression sickness and some injuries, but it's also become linked to a number of questionable cures. In addition to autism, it's been touted as a way to treat conditions as diverse as asthma, Alzheimer's disease, and spinal cord injuries, but the FDA has previously warned that none of these uses have been proven safe or effective. A 2012 study found no clear indication that hyperbaric oxygen therapy improved autism symptoms. The same is true for ""chelation therapies,"" which draw heavy metals from the body. In some circumstances, like lead poisoning, chelation therapies are applied under medical supervision. But a variety of over-the-counter sprays, pills, and other products promise to treat autism by removing mercury from the blood. Thiomersal, a mercury-based compound once used in vaccines, has been blamed for causing autism by a small but vocal anti-vaccine movement. But doctors and the FDA have warned that this widely discredited theory doesn't justify using chelation treatments, which can be accompanied by nausea, kidney failure, or death. Probiotics products, also on the list, have shown promise in treating autism, but they aren't accepted as a treatment at the moment. Neither are ""detoxifying clay baths,"" which also promise to draw out toxins. One of the FDA's most notorious targets is a cure-all called Miracle Mineral Solution, whose creator claims to have found ""the answer to AIDS, hepatitis A, B, and C, malaria, herpes, TB, most cancer, and many more of mankind's worse diseases.""

In the Vietnam War, Bob Walker had been a helicopter mechanic, and he’d watched as his best friend was decapitated by an incoming helicopter’s propeller blade. Ever since then the 69-year-old Paradise, CA vet has struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder — a psychological condition that afflicts 7–8 percent of the population. It hits people who have been exposed to highly stressful situations in which their “fight or flight” response has been activated. Rape survivors. War veterans. Policemen.  People with PTSD can be highly irritable and suffer from insomnia, nightmares, and the inability to sustain deep relationships. Or, like Walker, they can walk through life feeling eternally numb. “Over the years, I tried everything from prescription drugs to biofeedback,” says Walker. “But nothing really worked. I knew something just wasn’t right.” Bob Walker has suffered from PTSD for over 30 years. He's not alone in this struggle, but he claims to have found a way out through MDMA therapy. A group of specialists across the country are using the drug to heal trauma victims in ways previously unimaginable. Watch The Verge's exploration of this alternative treatment. Then one day three years ago, Walker saw a segment on CNN about an experimental drug trial going on in South Carolina to treat people suffering from PTSD. In the study, patients took MDMA, more commonly known by its street name ecstasy, in the company of psychotherapists. The drug’s famous warm-and-fuzzy ability to enhance a person’s well-being and create a surplus of empathy allowed many of the participants to revisit painful memories without their usual fear. In neurochemical terms, MDMA decreases the fear response in the amygdala. It also stimulates the release of the feel-good neurotransmitter serotonin, as well as oxytocin and prolactin, which cause feelings of love and bonding.  After taking the drug, many patients could look at their lives in a new way, reprocess trauma, and rewire their own brains. ""I got it, right away,"" says Walker, about watching the segment detailing the experiments. He figured, living right next to a college town, he could ostensibly score drugs easily. Why not try it himself? ""Finding MDMA was harder than I expected,"" he said. Asking around and attending a psychedelics event got him connected to some people doing sweat lodge and peyote ceremonies, but no ecstasy. But he finally tracked down ecstasy through a friend of a friend’s son and contacted a former therapist, who agreed to work with him while he was high. Jennifer*, who asked that her real name not be used because she feared she could lose her license,  was a self-described ""conservative"" single mom who was typically scared of drugs. But she felt a warmth for Walker and trusted him. ""For some reason, it didn’t feel wrong,"" she said. ""He had really done his research."" The first time was a therapy session like no other. ""He didn’t seem high, he just seemed ‘real,’"" she said. ""We were able to carry on an intimate conversation for the first time."" ""You lose your sense of connection,"" says Walker, describing the feeling of having PTSD. But on MDMA, Walker felt deeply connected, not just to his therapist, but also to himself, something he’d long struggled with. The drug trials that inspired Walker were the work of MAPS, a nonprofit research organization whose name stands for Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. It’s one of a small handful of organizations worldwide trying to establish scientific evidence that psychedelic drugs have therapeutic value. In the study looking at how MDMA could treat PTSD, the drug was given in conjunction with talk therapy. Patients lay down in a therapist's office and listened to soothing music with headphones, wearing eyeshades. They had the option of talking about what they were experiencing, and received counseling before and afterwards to integrate what happened to them while on the drug into their everyday lives. According to MAPS, 83 percent of the 19 people treated in a recent group had breakthroughs in this MDMA-assisted therapy and showed significant improvement in their PTSD symptoms. ""The MDMA allowed me to be my very, very, very best self, and I got to take care of my most broken self with my best self,"" says Rachel Hope, a sexual-abuse survivor who participated in the study. MAPS’ results from this study were encouraging enough to the FDA that it was able to expand its efforts into what’s known in drug-trial parlance as ""Phase 2 studies."" It’s now doing the same study with four new groups of patients in South Carolina, Colorado, Israel, and Vancouver. In addition to the MDMA-to-treat-PTSD study, MAPS has also studied how LSD can help soothe anxiety in people with terminal illnesses, and in March received approval to study the effects of marijuana to alleviate PTSD. The latter study will be one of only two government-approved medical marijuana trials ever conducted. Similarly to MAPS, the Santa Fe-based scientific research group the Heffter Research Institute has been collaborating with scientists at UCLA, Johns Hopkins, and NYU to study the therapeutic applications for psilocybin, the active ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms. In one study, published in 2011, it investigated how the drug might be used to make terminally ill cancer patients feel less anxious and depressed, and reported that of 11 patients given the drug, 30 percent reported an elevated mood that lasted long after the drug wore off. Now, Heffter scientists are looking at how psilocybin might help cure alcoholism and get people to quit smoking. In many ways, this research isn’t new. Besides the thousands of years of indigenous peoples’ ritual use of mind-altering plants like ayahuasca and peyote, there was some modern scientific exploration of these kinds of substances, too. Before it was criminalized in 1968, LSD was being used by some doctors as an experimental method for treating alcoholism and anxiety. MDMA, prior to being outlawed in 1985, was used by hundreds of psychotherapists in the United States to treat a variety of phobias, addiction, trauma, and even relationship problems. In an interview with psychiatrist Julie Holland, author of the book Ecstasy: The Complete Guide, one of these therapists recalled: ""When it came to, for instance, couples therapy, it was a remarkable catalyst."" MAPS and the Heffter Research Institute were founded with the mission of reintroducing these types of investigations and documenting their results in peer-reviewed journals. MAPS opened in 1986 and Heffter in 1993, after LSD, MDMA, and psilocybin became illegal. But until the 2000s this type of research would have been virtually impossible. The National Institute on Drug Abuse and negative media coverage throughout the ’80s and most of the ’90s depicted drugs like ecstasy, pot, and acid as a scourge without any therapeutic value. (This was the era of the infamous PSA: ""This is your brain on drugs!"") These drugs are all, in fact, categorized as ""Schedule 1"" by the Controlled Substances Act along with quaaludes and heroin, and are defined as having ""high potential for abuse and dependence"" and ""no currently accepted medical use.""  But personnel changes in the FDA and a softening of attitudes within the DEA and Institutional Review Boards, both of which greenlight drug trials, have opened up the field of psychedelic research like never before. ""A lot of the demonization of drugs as evil in all walks of American life has really calmed down,"" says Jeffrey A. Fagan, professor of law at Columbia University. ""And that’s a great thing. There’s no reason why we can’t think in careful and responsible steps about the therapeutic value of controlled substances."" As scientific evidence begins to mount, psychedelic researchers are looking towards a day when drugs like ecstasy, pot, LSD, and psilocybin will be categorized as ""Schedule 2"" drugs — that is, drugs that have risks associated with them, like Ritalin or Oxycontin, but can be prescribed by a doctor. Rick Doblin, the founder of MAPS, says he envisions a future when hospice centers for the terminally ill sit next to psychedelic therapy centers, and licensed doctors can prescribe MDMA in clinics similar to the way methadone is handled. ""Things are lining up in our culture and we have the opportunity to reintegrate psychedelics,"" says Doblin. ""They’ll have an honored place rather than a suppressed place."" But it may be too early for Doblin and his colleagues to get too excited. By the FDA’s own reporting, only 5 percent of all investigational new drugs actually make it through the testing and approval process. If any of the drugs that MAPS and the Heffter Research Institute are studying ultimately get approved for therapeutic use, the organizations’ research will have to show positive results among hundreds of participants. Conducting these larger ""Phase 3"" studies will cost millions of dollars. Unlike commercial pharmaceutical companies with deep pockets, MAPS and the Heffter Research Institute are privately funded, acting, essentially, as nonprofit pharmaceutical companies. The drugs they’re studying have patents that have expired, making them of little interest to Big Pharma. Anybody could ostensibly make generic versions of them, driving down price and potential earnings. Raising millions more from the public to continue this research won’t be easy, particularly because at least in the case of the Heffter Institute, psychedelic research operated under the radar for years. Dr. David E. Nichols, president and co-founder of the Heffter Research Institute says that his organization tried to keep its work on the down-low because it was widely considered controversial. Take the research around psilocybin and people with terminal illnesses, for example: ""There are a lot of taboos about how people die,"" says Nichols. But when Nichols describes the effects the drug can have on people dying of cancer, he presents a moving case that would be hard for anybody to ignore. ""We had one woman say, ‘I realized how precious the people are around me — and I want to enjoy them while I still have time here,’"" says Nichols, referring to a cancer patient who took psilocybin in his study and is now deceased. ""She said that it changed her completely, and she was able to embrace the life she had left, and it should be there as an option for people to do if they want."" Nichols believes that, culturally, we’re getting closer to that reality. Young people, he notes, are more accepting of things formerly viewed as social ills, like same-sex marriage and certain illegal drugs. ""The people who thought psychedelics were dangerous drugs are getting old and dying off,"" says Nichols. It may be that when future generations approach that time of life, they’ll do so with an open mind, and regulations may follow. Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that meth was a Schedule 1 drug, which is incorrect. It is classified as Schedule 2.

That's where new research from ETH Zürich comes in: chemists have found that they can dissolve synthetic DNA into oils to tag the product. The DNA can be coded to reveal the producer and other key information about the oil, and with a technique detailed in a paper published earlier this year in American Chemical Society Nano, the double-helixes can be encased in a layer of silica to produce ""synthetic fossils."" These ""fossils"" protect the DNA from damage that could ruin the tag, and the researchers magnetized them with iron oxide so that they can easily be removed from the oil for testing.  The primary benefit to this method is to make sure that products labeled extra virgin olive oil aren't just cheaper oils disguised with coloring and other chemicals to fool our senses. But the technique can also be used to check whether the oil's been adulterated. Olive oil fraudsters often cut expensive, difficult-to-produce extra virgin olive oil with cheaper oils, like soybean oil. Officials performing tests on olive oil would know exactly how much of the DNA should be in a sample, and if they found less they could safely conclude that the oil was adulterated. In the paper, researchers say that the ""synthetic fossils"" would cost a maximum of 0.02 cents per liter, roughly equivalent to the cost of a traditional barcode. And in their testing, they found that the tags can sit in oil for at least two years before becoming damaged. The synthetic DNA also causes no change in the clarity or taste of the oil, according to the researchers, and it's safe to consume (though additional testing would have to be done before any product ships with the tags). Nevertheless, the prospect of making it easier to get high-quality  extra virgin olive oil onto tables is an appealing prospect for foodies — even if it means dissolving some synthetic DNA in the bottle.",0.40211001942566965,0.5978899805743303,0.19093394790953963,372,4.81989247311828,215,5.8325581395348838,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Historically, biological and medical research has largely depended on rodents, which provide scientists with everything from cells and organs to behavioral data. That's why a new study in which researchers found that mice actually fear men, but not women, has the potential to be so disruptive. It might mean that a number of researchers have published mouse studies in which their results reflect this male-induced stress effect — and they know nothing about it. ""it may have confounded, to whatever degree, some very large subset of existing research."" ""People have not paid attention to this in the entire history of scientific research of animals,"" says Jeffrey Mogil, a pain researcher at McGill University and lead author of the study. ""I think that it may have confounded, to whatever degree, some very large subset of existing research."" Moreover, the effect probably isn't limited to behavioral studies, because the organs and cells that are used in medical research, such as in cancer studies, often originate in rodents. ""If you're doing a liver cell study, the cells came from a rat that was sacrificed either by a man or a woman,"" Mogil says. As a result, ""its stress levels would be in very different states."" This, he says, could have an effect on the functioning of the liver cell in that later experiment. In the study, published today in Nature Methods, researchers used the ""mouse grimace scale"" to measure pain responses in rodents exposed to men, women, or their respective smells. Pain is a proxy for stress because stress can, to a large extent, numb pain. So when the mice were confronted with the smell of men, they experienced less pain, whereas the presence of women — or their smell, Mogil says — ""did nothing at all."" This might seem like a positive effect, but think of it this way: when athletes get hurt during a stressful game, they often don't feel the injury right away, and they keep pushing. From an evolutionary standpoint, this is supposed to keep them alive by helping them focus on something other than pain. Yet in reality, it mostly just ends up making the injury worse. But pain wasn't the only indicator of stress in this study. Further experiments showed that the rodents also had increased body temperatures and levels of corticosterone, a stress hormone, in response to the smell of men. And the effect wasn't just prompted by human males, either. Rats and mice ""are afraid of the smell of males of any species,"" Mogil says, because the mice in this study reacted to the smell of male dogs, guinea pigs, and cats as well. competition, not predation The researchers think that mice react this way because of competition, and not predation. Male mice are territorial, Mogil says, even when it comes to females entering their domain. They also compete with males for mating opportunities, ""so it's probably a little bit evolutionarily adaptive to have this effect until you can determine that a male that's around doesn't actually mean you any harm,"" he says. In all likelihood, mice just haven't developed a way to discriminate between the smell of a male mouse and the smell of other male mammals, so men also elicit a fear response. Interestingly, the stress response isn't only dependent on the sex of an intruder, but also on the circumstances of his or her approach. ""If you put a male-worn T-shirt and a female-worn T-shirt in the same room, the female T-shirt counteracts the effect of a male T-shirt."" This, Mogil says, indicates that solitary males represent the real threat. ""A lone male is up to no good — either hunting or defending his territory."" Fortunately, the male-induced stress effect becomes less pronounced over time, eventually disappearing altogether. This, and the fact that women counteract the effect, means there are a number of ways that researchers could prevent it from showing up in data. ""Fire all the men — or have them chaperoned by a woman."" One option, Mogil says jokingly, ""is fire all the men — or have them chaperoned by a woman."" A more realistic approach, however, would be to have male experimenter sit in a room for 45 minutes before collecting data. That makes the problem go away. But the Mogil doubts that anyone will want to do that because ""it's just too boring."" Instead, Mogil hopes that his research — and other studies like it — will prompt researchers to report the gender of the experimenter in their publications. ""You don't have to go back very far to see studies where people didn't think the strain of mouse mattered or the sex of the mouse mattered,"" Mogil says. ""But these things all matter,"" and could be addressed in statistical analyses. For now, Mogil is looking forward to hearing from fellow researchers who might now have an answer for unusual results. ""I expect to hear stories, to hear people telling me that this sort of explains mysteries about experimenters not replicating each other, or having effects and then losing them,"" Mogil says. Because studies are so large these days, the graduate students who start them often don't see them through to completion, Mogil explains. So, women and men often end up taking on the same work in succession. Whether scientists will want to go back and check if their results were tainted by a male-induced stress response, however, is anybody's guess. As Mogil puts it, ""we will have to see.""",0.25372195556564836,0.7462780444343516,0.20249924262949134,931,4.8775510204081636,449,6.0579064587973273,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The FDA last week approved a DNA-based HPV test manufactured by Roche Molecular Systems as a primary screening option for cervical cancer. Called the ""cobas HPV test,"" the method detects DNA from high-risk HPV subtypes, and is already recommended for use alongside the traditional Pap smear. But the FDA's new approval changes two distinct features of how the test is used and promoted: it permits the use of an algorithm that enables the HPV test to be used on its own, and allows Roche to market its HPV test directly to consumers. Combined, those factors could spell the end of the Pap smear as we know it — a move that opponents say adds unnecessary confusion to an already complicated screening process, and jeopardizes women's health. Some cervical cancer cases don't start out with HPV The American Cancer Society and the US Preventative Task Force recommend that doctors screen women ages 21 to 65 every three years using a Pap smear — a test that scrapes cells from the cervix. Alternatively, the groups recommend a screening procedure called ""co-testing,"" which combines the Pap smear and the HPV test to screen women ages 30 to 65 for cervical cancer every five years. This is supposed to be more comprehensive, because a small percentage of cancer cases don't start with an HPV infection (caused by the sexually transmitted human papilloma virus) and another small percentage of cases don't present abnormalities detected through Pap smears. Yet the new Roche algorithm, developed from a study that followed over 40,000 women for three years, disrupts the co-testing procedure. Instead of taking the cervical swab and putting it under the microscope as well as through Roche's HPV test, the algorithm eliminates the Pap smear in a majority of cases. Moreover, it introduces HPV testing for women age 25 to 30, a group that doesn't need to get tested for HPV under current guidelines. This new process is supposed to increase early detection and stop more HPV infections from progressing to pre-cancer. But for the many groups who oppose the FDA approval, the possibility that some doctors might give up co-testing in favor of Roche's algorithm is disastrous because, according to them, this new screening procedure will cause confusion, yield unnecessary medical procedures, and could miss non-HPV cases of cervical cancer. The FDA approval is a big win for Roche, because the company can now advertise the cobas HPV test to women 25 and up, as well as to their doctors. ""Now that it's been approved, we are allowed to start talking about it with laboratories and clinicians,"" says Paul Brown, head of Roche Molecular Systems (which is owned by Roche), ""so we can start to inform them about the new use for the test."" Now Roche can advertise directly to patients But last week's FDA approval does nothing to change current cervical cancer screening recommendations. Co-testing for women 30 and up is still the recommended procedure, and those recommendations won't change unless various medical societies decide to do so. So now that the HPV test has gained approval, doctors and patients who see Roche's new ads will be free to choose it over the Pap test alone or co-testing. ""The practice of medicine is not regulated or controlled by the FDA,"" says Susan Wood, a former FDA official and current director of the Jacobs Institute of Women's Health, ""what is controlled is the marketing of the product."" And it's the marketing of the product, combined with what many say is a lack of evidence regarding the test's effectiveness as a primary screening method, that's making so many experts and advocates uncomfortable. ""We are not against the HPV test,"" says Diana Zuckerman, president of the Cancer and Prevention Treatment Fund. ""We are just against it as a primary screen by itself, and as any kind of screening for women under 30.""  The Pap smear and the HPV test seem exactly the same: both consist of a cervical swab. But unlike the Pap smear, which checks for abnormalities in cells taken from the cervix, the cobas HPV test pinpoints whether a patient is infected with one of 16 high-risk HPV subtypes — including two genotypes that are responsible for over 70 percent of cervical cancer cases. Under the new algorithm, women who test negative for HPV can go home without a Pap smear. Women who test positive for those two genotypes, however, go straight to colposcopy — a procedure that uses a magnifying tool to check a patient's cervix and vagina for abnormalities. A patient would only undergo a Pap smear if she had any of the 14 other high-risk genotypes. In that case, a normal Pap test means that she will need to be tested for HPV again the next year rather than waiting five years. The cobas HPV test doesn't catch everything But, according to a study published in 2004, about 4 percent of cervical cancer cases aren't HPV related. ""If a woman has cervical cancer,"" says Marshall Austin, a gynecological pathologist at the University of Pittsburgh, ""her HPV test will be negative about 10 percent of the time."" In other words, the cobas HPV test doesn't catch everything. Age is also a major area of contention. Prior the FDA's approval, the HPV test wasn't used for women age 25 to 30. ""There is no evidence to support using the HPV test in women under 30, and a lack of evidence to support changing the current guidelines,"" says Nida Degesys, national president of the American Medical Student Association. At that age, Wood and Degesys explain, women often clear HPV on their own, so testing them earlier means that women risk undergoing a number of unnecessary and invasive procedures. ""The evidence shows that persistent HPV is what puts you at higher risk,"" Wood says. ""So the HPV test is recommended after age 30 — not earlier than that — because that's when persistent virus occurs, and that's when women start to see cervical changes.""  (Carter Dow Photography / Roche) ""an improvement in detection"" But a letter issued by the FDA on April 24th in response to the approval's opponents states that screening women age 25 to 30 for HPV leads to ""an improvement in detection of 44 cases per 10,000 women,"" which the administration described as significant. ""Up until now, the cutoff has been 30, and there was good reason for that because there wasn't much available scientific data regarding younger women,"" Brown, of Roche Molecular Systems, explains. The Roche study, he says, ""showed that there was a surprising amount of women in that age group who had pre-cancer."" Opponents of the approval also argue that the new primary screening procedure will cause confusion among medical professionals. The screening guidelines are already ""pretty complicated,"" Chelmow says, ""and that's just with two choices: Pap testing by itself or co-testing."" By introducing a third option, some patients may end up switching back and forth. ""You will have the circumstance where a patient moves from being cared for elsewhere and can't get the records,"" he says, ""and you can't really tell what tests they had, so you don't know exactly when to do the next one."" Of all the arguments against the HPV test, the most controversial is that the new procedure will cause more women to undergo cervical biopsies — a procedure that, in serious cases, can cause women to experience complications during future childbirths. The FDA refutes that argument, noting that under the current guidelines, 4.7 percent of women are referred to colposcopy — the procedure doctors use to decide if a biopsy is necessary. With Roche's algorithm, that number is 4.6 percent. ""HPV primary screening is better than ‘current practice,'"" the FDA wrote, ""because it has the same percent of women being referred to colposcopy, but has an improved positive predictive value and similar negative predictive value.""  ""There is a level of subjectivity in reading Pap test slides."" And according to Roche, their HPV test is more reliable than a Pap smear: it uses a computer to detect specific DNA markers of certain HPV genotypes, whereas Pap-test slides are read by a pathologist. ""There is a level of subjectivity in reading Pap-test slides,"" Brown says. The DNA test, he says, lowers this risk of a misread result because ""the test runs on a fully automated instrument."" Like the HPV test, studies have shown that the Pap test falls short in some cases. ""We were able to show that 1 in 10 women who had a normal Pap had already gotten pre-cancer with HPV 16 and 18,"" Brown says. But given the current co-testing guidelines, some doctors argue that using both should identify risky and persistent HPV cases that come without cervical abnormalities, as well as any abnormalities that aren't accompanied by an HPV infection. ""I tend to be a fan of co-testing,"" Austin says, ""because you use HPV for its sensitivity and you use the Pap for its specificity."" ""there is a lot we don't know."" Now that the approval has gone through, Austin thinks the medical community will simply have to wait and see how patients react. Unfortunately, he says, the approval will make it hard to decipher if the new procedure is really effective, because it's likely that most women will go through each screening procedure interchangeably. ""I don't think the new test is a bad test,"" Austin says. ""I just think that there is a lot we don't know."" In the meantime, the Society for Gynecologic Oncology said it was developing an interim guidance document that will help doctors incorporate primary HPV testing into cervical cancer screening. If medical societies do decide to change their guidelines, most women won't notice a difference; the cervical swab to which they're are accustomed will still take place. But under Roche's algorithm, the vast majority of swabs will be discarded after going through the company's machines. ""Because the specimen was collected in a cytology vial, you still have the sample,"" that pathologists use to perform the Pap test, Austin says. The difference is that by using Roche's algorithm ""you are just electing not to do a second FDA-approved test.""",0.41365843676886704,0.586341563231133,0.8540774729599937,1710,4.9514619883040938,690,6.4086956521739129,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The upper floors of the building seemed to house a bilingual preschool, going by the many large surfaces covered in multicolored paint handprints; the ground floor was made up of multipurpose meeting rooms administered by the Unitarian Universalist church down the block. Four people had been listed as ""attending"" on the Facebook page for the event, but by the time the meeting began, eight Esperantists were sitting in a rough semicircle of dormroom couches and hard plastic chairs. The exuberantly mustached Neil Blonstein, president of the Society, was presiding behind a folding banquet table, wearing a white T-shirt printed with the word ""ESPERANTO"" and a photo of a group of Esperantists at a convention. There were grapes and crackers by the door. That night, the Society consisted of seven men, including Neil, and one woman (though Neil’s girlfriend, also an Esperantist, did show up later). Some were young, most were not. The agenda for the evening included two speeches, each followed by discussion. The talks were difficult to follow if you didn’t know any Esperanto, but a rusty background in French allowed for an understanding of the broad strokes. Tech was in the air. A bearded Brooklyn College junior read an account of a conference he’d gone to the previous weekend called Organizing 2.0, peppered with the untranslated names of apps, and followed by a discussion of the uses and meaning of MailChimp. Then, a composer and member of Mensa gave a speech on Wikipedia, specifically the problems that crowdsourcing presents for smaller languages. He compared Esperanto to Bislama, the language of the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu. Despite having 250,000 native speakers, Bislama Wikipedia only has 444 pages. Esperanto Wikipedia has over 215,000. Like its vastly more successful digital cousins — C++, HTML, Python — Esperanto is an artificial language, designed to have perfectly regular grammar, with none of the messy exceptions of natural tongues. Out loud, all that regularity creates strange cadences, like someone speaking Italian slowly while chewing gum. William Auld, the Modernist Scottish poet who wrote his greatest work in Esperanto, was nominated for the Nobel Prize multiple times, but never won. But it is supremely easy to learn, like a puzzle piece formed to fit into the human brain. Invented at the end of the 19th century, in many ways it presaged the early online society that the web would bring to life at the end of the 20th. It’s only ever been spoken by an assortment of fans and true believers spread across the globe, but to speak Esperanto is to become an automatic citizen in the most welcoming non-nation on Earth. Decades before Couchsurfing became a website (or the word website existed), Esperantists had an international homestay service called Pasporta Servo, in which friendly hosts around the world listed their phone numbers and home addresses in a central directory available to traveling Esperantists. It may be a small, widely dispersed, and self-selected diaspora, but wherever you go, there are Esperantists who are excited that you exist. It sounds hokey, but this is the central appeal of Esperanto. It’s as if the initial utopian vibes of the World Wide Web had never reached a wider audience. There’s no money, no power, no marketing, no prestige — Esperanto speakers speak Esperanto because they believe in it, and because it’s fun to speak a foreign language almost instantly, after a couple months of rolling the words around in your mouth. The internet, though, has been a mixed blessing for Esperanto. While providing a place for Esperantists  to convene without the hassle of traveling to conventions or local club meetings, some Esperantists believe those meatspace meet ups were what held the community together. The Esperanto Society of New York has 214 members on Facebook, but only eight of them showed up for the meeting. The shift to the web, meanwhile, has been haphazard, consisting mostly of message boards, listservs, and scattered blogs. A website called Lernu! — Esperanto for the imperative ""learn!"" — is the center of the Esperanto internet, with online classes and an active forum. But it’s stuck with a Web 1.0 aesthetic, and the forum is prone to trolls, a byproduct of Esperanto’s culture of openness to almost any conversation as long as it’s conducted in — or even tangentially related to — Esperanto. But there’s hope that the internet can give the language new life. Wikipedia and its 215,000 pages was a first step, and yesterday, Esperanto debuted on Duolingo, a virtual learning app with 20 million active users — far more people than have ever spoken Esperanto since its invention.    The assembled Esperantists in that scuffed room on East 35th Street knew the Duolingo course was coming, and they were optimistic. The word Esperanto, after all, means ""one who hopes."" But the final item on the meeting’s agenda underscored what all those virtual Esperantists were missing. After the speeches, Neil got up and passed out sheets printed with the lyrics to ""Fremdaj en la Nokt,"" the Esperanto version of the Sinatra hit ""Strangers in the Night."" He explained that a particular Italian Esperantist had an extensive YouTube presence and a habit of jumping into worldwide Esperanto forums and Facebook groups to plug his singing. This was one of his better songs. Neil settled back down behind his banquet table, counted out the time, and the eight attending members of the New York Esperanto Society started to sing.     Esperanto was invented in 1887 by a Polish ophthalmologist named L.L. Zamenhof, who hoped his creation would bring about world peace. Zamenhof saw a turbulent world divided by language, and concluded that the situation was too complicated, essentially unfair, and ultimately doomed. He believed that the languages people already spoke were oversaturated with history, politics, and power, making it impossible to communicate clearly. Esperanto was a fresh start, a technology that would allow its speakers to sidestep the difficulties of natural languages altogether. He made it as easy to learn as possible, with no irregular verbs, a vocabulary adapted from Romance language roots, and a simple, genderless, almost caseless grammar. The late 19th century was the heyday of the artificial language, and before Esperanto, an artificial language called Volapük was all the rage, with almost a million speakers across Europe. Zamenhof dismissed it as too difficult to speak (the Esperanto word for ""gibberish"" is still volapukaĵo), and by the late 1880s, it was starting to unravel. Zamenhof wrote his first book describing Esperanto in Russian, and he called the language the studiously dull Lingvo Internacia, or ""International Language."" But he published it under the pen name ""Doktoro Esperanto,"" meaning ""Doctor Hoper"" in his new idiom, and like Doctor Frankenstein before him, soon found that people were calling his creation by the name of its creator. With its simplicity and supposed neutrality, he was hoping his language would make it to the Fina Venko, the ""Final Victory,"" his term for the Esperanto rapture: the day when the whole world would speak his invention as a second language, facilitating clear, neutral, and ultimately peaceful dialogue among all humanity. Babel, basically, be gone. Progress was slow in the early days. Zamenhof and his buddies started publishing a magazine in Esperanto, and word trickled out over the continent. Eighteen years after the first book describing Esperanto was published, there were 27 Esperanto magazines in regular production, and Zamenhof decided it was time to mark a new phase in the movement by doing what nerdy subcultures do best: he organized a convention. This was 1905, so they called it a ""world congress,"" and 688 people showed up to discuss their new language in their new language. At least one convention has been held every year since, save the cumulative 10 years of World Wars, and conventions are still the major feature of the Esperanto social calendar. As the movement grew, it started attracting notice from powerful places, not all of it positive. The League of Nations almost adopted Esperanto, but the idea was shot down by the French delegate. Zamenhof was Jewish, so Adolf Hitler denounced Esperanto as a language designed to unify the Jewish diaspora, and the Nazis were officially anti-Esperanto. Joseph Stalin was reportedly an Esperantist, but he turned on the language in the late '30s, calling it a ""language of spies,"" and started purging people who spoke it. Ayatolla Khomeini, too, waffled on Esperanto. Shortly after the Iranian Revolution, he urged his people to learn the language as an anti-imperialist counterpoint to English, and an official translation of the Qur’an followed. But adherents of the Baha’i faith had been fans of Esperanto for decades, and Khomeini was definitely not a fan of Baha’i, so his enthusiasm dimmed. And Baha’i’s not the only smaller religion that’s embraced Esperanto as a liturgical language. In Brazil, which has one of the world’s largest populations of Esperantists, the language is intimately associated with the séance-centric Spiritist movement, and many followers of the neo-Shinto Japanese religion Oomoto have studied some Esperanto. Mao Zedong liked Esperanto too. The Communist Party of China has published an Esperanto magazine, El Popola Ĉinio, since 1950, and state radio stations still regularly broadcast in the language. And perhaps most famously, George Soros grew up speaking Esperanto, though his public involvement with the language hasn’t gone beyond getting his father’s Esperanto memoirs translated into English. Mostly, though, Esperanto survived the 20th century on the strength of the local clubs and spread by chance encounters and word of mouth. This culture created hundreds of books, dozens of publications, and at least four known full-length feature films. Today, nobody has any good idea how many people have even heard of Esperanto, let alone speak it fluently. Some estimate that millions can ""parolas Esperanton,"" but a Finnish linguist who’s studied the 1,000 or so native Esperanto speakers in the world came up with more reasonable ballpark numbers:  around 100,000 can speak it to some degree, and only 10,000 are totally fluent. There’s no federal Esperanto government to pay for a census, and the decline of the local clubs and societies has made any kind of headcount nearly impossible. It’s not easy being artificial. This would be great for computers to learn, was the first thought that Chuck Smith had about Esperanto. It was 2001, and he was in college, taking a class called Models of Mind. With its logical structure, Smith thought Esperanto could work as a bridge language for translation, especially between two languages like Finnish and Turkish, that are unlikely to have a large overlapping dataset that a machine translation program could use. Just as Zamenhof intended, Esperanto would be the metamedium of communication across tongues. Smith didn’t pursue that idea beyond the class, but he did pursue Esperanto. The summer after Models of Mind, he went to Esperanto meetings in New York and San Francisco. Like every Esperantist I spoke with, the radiant chumminess of the Esperanto world drew Smith in. The following fall, he tapped the Esperanto network to find a place to stay during a board game fair in Essen, Germany. He was hooked, and he had a new angle: he wanted to use computers to help people learn Esperanto. So he started Vikipedio, the Esperanto Wikipedia. This was 2001, and Esperanto was only the 11th language to have its own version. The first article, ""Modernismo,"" was imported from an extant online Esperanto encyclopedia called La Enciklopedio Kalblanda, or ""The Kalb Land Encyclopedia,"" which a guy named Stefano Kalb had been slowly writing since 1995. Lernu! launched a year later. More people visit Vikipedia, but this is the site that first posted free Esperanto classes online that were more advanced than email versions of the pen-and-paper correspondence courses that had existed for decades. It made learning the language easier, but some in the community believe that the popularity of its forums also sped the decline of the Esperanto clubs — instead of being a quiet member at a meeting, you could just lurk on the Lernu! forums. While Esperanto became more digital, Smith dug deeper into Esperanto’s real-world organizations. He attended conferences, backpacked across Europe and stayed only with Esperantists, and started working at various Esperanto organizations in Europe and Canada. He landed in Berlin, and started a company, Ludisto (Esperanto for ""player""), that makes iOS games. So when Duolingo launched in 2012, Smith was one of the thousands who requested Esperanto for the new, free, and intentionally addictive language learning program. Duolingo eventually tapped Smith to be Team Leader for the development of the Esperanto course that went live yesterday. He’s the public face of tech Esperanto in many ways, serving time as a guest on podcasts and logging many thousands of words on his own Esperanto-centric blog on Transparent Language. But the actual work of making the Duolingo course for Esperanto has largely fallen to a relative newcomer to the language: Ruth Kevess-Cohen, a DC-area doctor in her 50s specializing in internal medicine and geriatrics. ""It would be unusual to start from zero and, after two years, be able to develop a course in any other language,"" Kevess-Cohen told me. ""Maybe some geniuses, you know, but I’m just doing it in my spare time."" She heard of Esperanto first as a possibility for a new Duolingo course, and then sought it out elsewhere. First she looked up the course on Lernu, but ultimately learned the language through the oldest method available: a correspondence course. After practicing the regular grammar with pen and paper, she spent a couple weeks at an intensive Esperanto immersion camp in Raleigh, North Carolina, and found that she could already understand what longtime Esperantists were saying. The community was welcoming, and the ability to suddenly speak a new language was practically addictive. Ruth, just like Chuck, was in. That sense of empowerment has drawn the growing language hacking community to Esperanto, too. Benny Lewis, a man better known as Benny the Irish Polyglot, has built a career on telling people how to learn languages as quickly as humanly possible. His website, fluentinthreemonths.com, is the center of his business, and he’s written a book with the same name. If you ask where he lives, he says that he’s been traveling for 12 years. He claims to be fluent in 7 languages, and proficient in many more. Benny first encountered Esperanto through couchsurfing (he says he’s hosted over 2,000 people on his own couches), and was immediately intrigued. His core language learning principle is confidence — the trick to being fluent in three months, he says, isn’t any kind of drug or special flashcard system, but a willingness to be humiliated by speaking a language poorly as soon as you know a single word. And Esperanto is the ideal language for shamelessness: it’s simple, and almost everyone is a relative newcomer. Many studies, most of them conducted in the first half of the 20th century, found that Esperanto had a marked propaedeutic effect on language learning, which is a fancy Latinate way to say that, if you take college Esperanto classes for a year and college French classes for three years after that, you’ll know more French than if you took four straight years of college French. The hyper-regularity of Esperanto makes it supremely easy to learn, and its newness, its foreignness, primes the monolingual brain to learn more complicated newness even more quickly. ""Your brain starts to accept how to say words in another language without having to worry about complexity,"" is how Benny puts it. He believes in Esperanto as a springboard to other languages so much that he convinced his girlfriend to learn Esperanto as her first foreign language, and filmed every minute of her progress. As a language hacker, Benny scoffs at the slow pace of academic language learning — he doesn’t recommend six months or a year of Esperanto, followed by years of French, but rather two weeks, just two weeks, of intensive Esperanto training, followed by a couple more months of anything else you’d like to learn. ""Ultimately it’s an easy language,"" he said, ""and it’s not intimidating."" He remembered his first attempts to learn German and Spanish, and being cowed in the face of all their particular grammatical rules and irregularities. Esperanto, on the other hand, is pure self-esteem. Plus, there’s a whole world of Esperanto speakers who are happy to hop on Skype to help out a neophyte — good luck finding a friendly francophone to do the same for free. Esperantists like to talk about logic: Zamenhof made the grammar to be logical; Chuck Smith found that logicality intriguing; Benny the Irish Polyglot finds that the language's logic makes it a logical choice for language hacking; and Duolingo chose Chuck Smith as the logical person to create its Esperanto course. But by what logic did Duolingo decide to make an Esperanto class at all? Over 30 million English speakers have signed up to learn Spanish on Duolingo, and even more Spanish speakers have signed up to learn English. Anglophones also have French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Irish, Swedish, Danish, Turkish, Norwegian, and Ukrainian, in descending order of popularity, available to learn for free. Esperanto is the 13th language to be offered, chosen over many others with speaking populations 10 times larger. Esperanto, though, has enthusiasm. When Duolingo first launched, Luis von Ahn, its founder, was surprised to find that Esperanto was the number one most requested new language for the program. ""Speakers and supporters of Esperanto are very hardcore,"" von Ahn said over email, ""and vocal!"" Esperantists are linguistic evangelists — the community saw an opportunity for expansion, and pounced. Two of the other languages available on Duolingo fit a similar bill, though by dint of history rather than original intent; Irish and Ukrainian are both associated with strong nationalist movements. Irish was the first of many languages that English would violently suppress, and Ukrainian is shoring up its ramparts to avoid the same fate from Russian regional control. Esperanto, of course, was designed precisely to transcend linguistic nationalism and ultimately avoid conflict, but the end result is similar: a small group of people intensely invested in seeing their language spread. But Esperanto on Duolingo makes sense in a deeper way, as well. Both the language and the app were created, at least in part, to solve the same problem: the world is divided by language, and more importantly, the majority is often forced to learn the native tongue of a powerful minority in order to get by. In Zamenhof’s time, Yiddish or Polish speakers in his hometown of Bialystok had to learn Russian to interact with the ruling state. Today, anyone who doesn’t speak English is born at a disadvantage, and probably can’t afford Rosetta Stone. Von Ahn didn’t just create Duolingo to give Anglophones a fun, free way to learn new languages — he created it for the non-Anglophone majority that’s stuck with the burden of learning English. There might be 13 languages available for English speakers on Duolingo, but English courses are available in 22 world languages. Zamenhof saw the same problem and took a more radical tack. Instead of starting a network of free, worldwide language schools, he invented a free, worldwide language. Twenty-five thousand people have signed up to be notified  when the Esperanto Duolingo course goes live. If just those people complete the course, that would qualify as an Esperanto baby boom. But Chuck Smith is thinking bigger: ""I keep saying that, by the end of the year, over 200,000 people will be learning Esperanto on Duolingo."" The world will probably never see the Fina Venko, but the internet does have a way of hypercharging communities that never could have existed before it. Who could have imagined that more than one Brony would ever exist, or that Americans would want to write thousands of pages of Harry Potter slash fiction. And soon, Esperanto might not even be the least likely artificial language to get a signal boost from Duolingo: the Klingon course is on track to debut in 2016. Linguistically, the language is the exact opposite of Esperanto. Its grammar was designed to be as difficult to learn as possible, and its vocabulary is strongest when discussing the warlike and brutal traditions of Klingon culture. ""Many who try it will drop it later,"" admitted André Müller, the German PhD student who’s creating the Klingon course. ""But some might enjoy the challenge, a very Klingon thing to do."" Given the language’s difficulty, he considers himself to be only a ""conversational"" Klingon speaker. He is also fluent in Esperanto.

Almost any time you see someone from a university praising Bitcoin, that person is from the computer science department. And if you see someone from a university criticizing Bitcoin, that person is likely from the economics department. It’s understandable why technologists gravitate toward a math-based currency. But why don’t economists like Bitcoin? It’s not that economists are Luddites, as Bitcoin fanatics might say, although no doubt there is an element of bedeutungslosigkeitschmach. Rather, it’s because the odds are objectively against Bitcoin’s long-term success. It’s very difficult to start anything that depends on a lot of people using it, and the challenges proliferate when that thing is a whole entire new type of money. There are countless possible deaths of Bitcoin. The technology fails. Overspeculation causes an irrecoverable crash. The price never settles down. Deflationary pressure annihilates liquidity. A government shuts it down. A new currency makes it obsolete. Users abandon it for some other reason. And so on. Objectively, the odds are against Bitcoin’s long-term success It’s difficult to predict what will happen to Bitcoin because it is unlike any currency ever created. You can draw parallels to monetary anomalies like e-Gold, the stone coin statues of Yap, or the Iraqi dinar, but there’s never been anything quite like it. Instead of a central authority, it is governed by a computer protocol. Instead of serving one country or group of countries, it serves the whole world. And because its source code is public, anyone can launch their own version of Bitcoin at any time. ""It’s something economists had never had to think about until this was developed, and we're just beginning to think through all the implications of it,"" says Steve Horwitz, an economist at St. Lawrence University who studies private monetary systems. ""There’s not a unanimous opinion for sure."" University of Berkeley economist Brad DeLong believes that Bitcoin will fail because the cost of producing a Bitcoin clone is zero. George Mason economist Tyler Cowen agrees, and adds a warning about deflation. Krugman’s main concern of late is the predictability of Bitcoin’s value in the future. Bitcoin’s success has the potential to disrupt a lot of ideas about money.  ""To be successful, money must be both a medium of exchange and a reasonably stable store of value,"" Krugman writes. He isn’t convinced that Bitcoin is a good medium of exchange, but it’s the store of value question where Bitcoiners think very differently from economists. In Krugman’s mind, a currency that is a reliable store of value is traditionally either backed by a central authority willing to buy back the currency, the way the dollar is backed by the Treasury, or it has some intrinsic value, the way gold can be made into jewelry. If a currency has no central authority and no intrinsic value, people can’t trust that it will retain value over time. ""It’s something economists had never had to think about until this was developed."" There is some evidence that human psychology may assume a store of value where an economist would say there is none, however. In 1993, Saddam Hussein started printing his own currency, the Saddam dinar, which citizens were told to exchange for their old 25-dinar notes. Citizens had little confidence in the dictator, who was printing Saddam dinars like crazy. They kept using their old dinars as a medium of exchange and believed it was a relatively stable store of value. Of course, they were wrong. The old dinar gained in value until one was worth 300 Saddam dinars. But in 2003, the US occupation government announced a new Iraqi dinar at an exchange rate that cut the old dinar’s value in half. If Bitcoin is successful, it could prove that money doesn’t need to function as a stable store of value — the price of Bitcoin could jump around constantly, and in the age of the internet it’s trivial to program prices of goods and services to fluctuate with it. Its success could also prove that use as a medium of exchange can be the basis for believing a currency is a store of value. If people believe that they will be able to buy things with Bitcoin and exchange it for other currencies indefinitely, that could convince them to use it as a store of value. Many early adopters have already put their savings into Bitcoin. And if the technology is sound and the user base is (eventually) global, that doesn’t seem that insane. That’s why technologists keep talking about Bitcoin as a means of exchange when Krugman asks them why it’s a stable store of value: if Bitcoin takes off as a global means of exchange, that could be enough to make it succeed. The Economist put it best: ""All currencies involve some measure of consensual hallucination, but Bitcoin... involves more than most.""

Thomas Chien, HTC's vice president of product design, is alleged to have leaked upcoming smartphone interface designs to a partner who he planned to start a new business with. Along with five other HTC employees, Chien has reportedly also been charged for collectively receiving around 33.57 million New Taiwan dollars (US$1.12 million) by falsifying expenses and receiving kickbacks from suppliers. Three employees from unidentified suppliers of HTC have also been indicted. Chien and the other HTC employees were first arrested in August regarding these charges. At the time, it was reported that the designs Chien leaked were of Sense 6.0, which would be an upcoming, unannounced version of HTC's Android software and interface.

Update Tuesday, September 9th, 10:44 pm EST: Zephyr Teachout and Tim Wu lost their respective bids in the Democratic primary on September 9th, according to reports. Still, they performed better than expected and their late-stage traction may set them up for other political futures.  Most of the tech industry will be focused on Cupertino, California, tomorrow, where Apple is hosting a much-hyped event, likely to unveil a new iPhone 6 and iWatch. But September 9th could see another tech milestone: the election of Tim Wu, a Columbia law professor nicknamed the ""father of net neutrality,"" as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor of New York state. If Wu wins in the primary against his rival Kathy Hochul, a former Congresswoman, it would be a huge upset, making him very likely to win the general election in November. Wu's running mate is Zephyr Teachout, a fellow law professor at Fordham university who has an even tougher race to become New York's first female governor, challenging sitting Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo (she has extremely low name recognition, according to a recent poll).  ""I have pushed ideas from the academic fringe to the mainstream."" Still, Teachout and Wu made an aggressive final push on Monday to court the votes of New York's tech entrepreneurs, appearing at an event at startup Meetup's headquarters in Manhattan to unveil their tech policy platform. Their plan includes a fierce opposition to Comcast's attempted merger with New York-based internet and TV provider Time Warner Cable, as well as enshrining net neutrality into state law, and opening up more radio spectrum for wireless internet experimentation in the state. ""I have pushed ideas from the academic fringe to the mainstream in defense of an open internet,"" Wu said. ""Net Neutrality was an obscure academic idea ten years ago, even fifteen years ago...I don't take all the credit for that, but I take some."" It's no surprise Wu is leaning so heavily on his tech bonafides. That's where he has the most experience and could draw the most support. He coined the widely-used term ""network neutrality"" in 2003 to describe the idea that internet service providers shouldn't discriminate against different types of traffic by making users pay more for online video, for example, and his idea is now under siege. He served as a senior advisor to the Federal Trade Commission back in 2011, with a focus on tech and consumer protection. He's already won the endorsement of the New York Times, and just today, he and Teachout received the endorsements of numerous tech founders, including Reddit's Alexis Ohanian. Altogether, Wu may be the most tech savvy political candidate outside of Congressman Jared Polis from Colorado, cofounder of several early consumer web companies and a Techstars advisor. Wu is running for a seat that was left vacant by former lieutenant governor Robert Duffy, who announced his retirement in May. Wu's opponent, Kathy Hochul, is a former Republican Congressman from upstate, who switched parties after being handpicked for the job of lieutenant governor by Cuomo. And while she and Cuomo may have more name recognition to voters than Teachout and Wu, the voters still get to decide. Cuomo and his supporters may be more worried about the race than they let on: Cuomo's campaign filed a lawsuit to remove Teachout from the ballot over residency questions (it was dismissed), and The New York Post reported today that the governor and his allies, including New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio, have been threatening fellow Democrats in power not to support Teachout and Wu. Teachout and Wu aren't exactly taking the hits sitting down though: their campaign also filed a lawsuit against Cuomo's over mailings and fliers, which Daily Kos suspects is actually a move to get them more name recognition in the run-up to the vote. ""no longer a lackey or a bystander, but an advocate for the public."" In New York, you don't have to vote for the governor and lieutenant governor as a package deal, so it is conceivable that Wu could end up winning his race while Teachout loses hers. If that happens, Wu says he would support Governor Cuomo but still maintain his independence and advocate for positions favorable to New Yorkers and to tech entrepreneurs. He's campaigned over the past few months on a promise to be a ""public advocate"" if elected, someone unafraid to publicly disagree with his boss if their views don't align. ""I propose to re-invent the lieutenant governor position as no longer a lackey or a bystander, but an advocate for the public,"" Wu said at today's event, citing the Comcast-Time Warner merger as an example. ""New York state has the power to block the merger; it should use that power. This merger is no good for consumers."" Whether Wu has that opportunity to be that kind of politician remains to be seen. Either way, tomorrow will be a big test of the draw of a candidate whose main appeal is based on their tech bonafides.

In a letter to FCC chair Tom Wheeler, Pelosi writes that Title II is ""an appropriate tool to refine modern rules,"" and that it can do so without the FCC overburdening broadband providers. The reason that the FCC is currently amid this whole internet ""fast lane"" debacle is that it's chosen to regulate internet providers using a less stringent allowance in the Communications Act. Though the commission could go ahead and use Title II — allowing it to impose more significant regulations and avoid fast lanes — it would be a politically tricky move that would upset internet giants who have a large lobbying force in Washington. The FCC is currently accepting public comments on its proposal to use the method that would allow for fast lanes, and advocates are looking for it to change course. ""An appropriate tool to refine modern rules"" ""I remain concerned ... that the Federal Communications Commission may act in a way that would permit broadband providers to discriminate against the content consumers and innovators create and enjoy,"" Pelosi writes. ""Innovators prefer bright-line rules and worry the proposed rules would force them into commercial arrangements that require payment of tolls in cash or equity to get their ideas on the internet."" Though Pelosi can't directly alter the FCC's decision, her position as minority leader of the House gives her opinion significant sway and should set an example for other Democrats. Her language already echoes exactly what we've seen from other net neutrality advocates — the only difference is that most haven't gone so far as to explicitly endorse the controversial Title II classification. Pelosi also notes that Title II will allow the commission to protect consumers against fraudulent billing and privacy infringements. The FCC's period for reply comments on its net neutrality proposal closes next Monday. Its initial commenting period received 1.1 million replies from the public.

Hundreds of millions of dollars seized, all without pressing charges But the legal justification is only part of the practice.

As the Associated Press reports, Governor Mary Fallin's announcement comes following the release of a state investigation into the April execution of Clayton Lockett, who convulsed violently for 43 minutes before succumbing to a drug cocktail administered by injection. Prison officials at first claimed that Lockett died of a heart attack, but autopsy results released last week show that he was killed by the injected drugs. In its report, the Department of Public Safety said that Lockett's unusually long execution was caused by a misplaced intravenous line that was inserted into his groin. Prison officials placed it there because they couldn't find appropriate injection points on his legs and torso, but covered Lockett and the IV with a sheet. As a result, they weren't able to monitor the IV, and only realized that the injection area had swollen after it became clear that was something was awry. ""If I am assured as governor that those protocols are in place... then we can look forward to returning to executions."" The report includes 11 recommendations to avoid similar cases, including more training for medical staff and greater supplies of lethal drugs and equipment. It also calls for injection areas to be visible at all times, and for state prisons to develop clear emergency response procedures. The state corrections department is reviewing the recommendations, which Governor Fallin expects to be implemented before executions resume. In May, the state delayed the execution of a convicted murder and rapist by six months amid controversy over Lockett's death. ""If I am assured as governor that those protocols are in place... then we can look forward to returning to executions,"" Fallin said. ""But until all of those protocols have been put in place, we won't be having executions."" ""it should have been stopped, but it wasn't."" Lockett's execution marked the first time that Oklahoma administered midazolam — a sedative that was used in combination with two other drugs. Midazolam was used in two other gruesome executions this year, in Ohio and Arizona, but Oklahoma's public safety commissioner stressed that in Lockett's case, the drugs worked as expected. Several US states have begun administering experimental drugs in recent years, as wary companies and governments have restricted supplies of traditional drugs. Oklahoma's response to Lockett's death has drawn criticism from defense attorneys, who describe the report as tepid. Fallin chose public safety commissioner Michael Thompson to oversee the review (Thompson is also charged with overseeing prisons), ignoring calls for an independent investigator. The report also refrains from blaming any individuals for the botched execution, and officials are not considering charges. ""Once the execution was clearly going wrong, it should have been stopped, but it wasn't,"" Dale Baich, a Phoenix public defender representing other death row inmates, said in a statement.

Workers at the Taiwanese supply company Catcher Technology's factory in Suqian, China, are routinely exposed to numerous health and safety risks, as well as discriminatory hiring practices, according to a report released online today by advocacy groups Green America and China Labor Watch (both groups have been persistent watchdogs of the manufacturing companies behind big tech brands, including Samsung). The plant cited in the latest report manufacturers aluminum cases for various Apple products, including an unreleased new iPad model rumored for 2015. The very same plant was also cited for some of the same violations last year. This time, an investigator working undercover at the plant in August documented discriminatory hiring practices in addition to massive safety violations. The factory reportedly turned away applicants with tattoos and those over age 46; failed to train employees on safety protocols; didn't provide protective equipment for workers handling toxic materials; dumped hazardous chemicals directly into a nearby river; blocked fire exits in the factory; allowed workers to smoke in areas with flammable aluminum dust; and had some workers accrue over 100 hours of overtime a month. The report estimates that Catcher may have been underpaying workers collectively by $290,000 a month for their overtime labor.  The fire risks posed by dust accumulation are especially worrisome, given the fact that back in 2011, metal dust accumulation at Foxconn, another Apple supplier, precipitated an explosion that killed three workers and injured many others. The report from China Labor Watch and Green America notes that most of the conditions described not only violate Apple's Supplier Code of Conduct, but also, in some cases, Chinese labor law. The report does give Apple credit for phasing out the use of two other hazardous chemicals in use at several supplier factories last month, but calls upon the company to do more to ensure worker safety at the factories of its third-party suppliers. In response, Apple issued a statement to The Washington Post saying it had immediately sent a team of its own investigators to the Catcher factory to investigate the reported violations.",0.47934471477436735,0.5206552852256326,0.854855966732924,387,5.3772609819121451,239,6.2133891213389125,0,0,"Apple, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

In recent years, he's become one of the loudest voices in support of internet freedom and its benefit to society. He believes the internet is the most powerful and democratic tool ever made for sharing information, and is a strong supporter of net neutrality regulation. Today, I am calling on my fellow founders and investors (and anyone who loves the Internet) to join me in fighting to protect net neutrality.  Internet freedom activists have organized a day of mass action to protect net neutrality on Wednesday, September 10th. On that day, every large company, every startup, and anyone with a blog or website should use tools available here (or create tools of their own) to organize their users to become an army of citizen-lobbyists. The internet needs you. For those who don’t know me, Steve Huffman and I co-founded Reddit, one of the top 50 websites on the internet. I’ve got a webseries here on The Verge called Small Empires. I’m also a partner at Y Combinator, the top early stage investment fund, whose investments include Dropbox, Airbnb, Heroku, Pebble, Twitch, Crowdtilt, Coinbase, and ZenPayroll, among others. Most importantly, like most of you, I love the open internet.  The internet is where we build friendships, conduct commerce, create and destroy Today’s internet is the most democratic vehicle for free expression the world has ever known. It’s an open and free market for small and large businesses, giving any inventor in her garage the hope that she’s creating tomorrow’s Google or next year’s Facebook. It’s where we build friendships, conduct commerce, create and destroy; it’s where we live more and more of our lives everyday. Which is why I take it so personally whenever those in our government try to destroy this place that is so special. We’ve successfully headed off some of these threats before: censorship bills disguised as copyright law (SOPA) and attempted mass surveillance laws disguised as cybersecurity (CISPA). But now we face a new threat, one that would undermine the most basic principles of the internet as we know it. That threat is a legal proposal by the Federal Communications Commission that would authorize cable and phone companies to create a two-tiered internet, with congested Internet slow lanes for all of us and fast lanes for the giants that can pay them. Why would the FCC want to protect cable companies who already face hardly any competition and make 90 percent profit on the internet service they sell us? The FCC has proposed a legally unequal web — one where those who provide us internet access would be gatekeepers, not gateways. It’s an internet where we’d all need to buy a permission slip (that most of us can’t afford) from Comcast or Time Warner Cable to compete, innovate, and organize equally. We can’t let this happen. Really. This would be a clusterfuck worse than Comcast’s customer service. Why are people in DC even thinking about this, let alone getting to the brink of doing it? Cable and phone companies spend more money on lobbying in DC than oil companies, pharmaceuticals, and most defense contractors. Worse, cable lobbyists go on to hold some of the most senior jobs across the government — including Tom Wheeler, the man at the top of the FCC. Even though millions of us across the world support Team Internet, Washington, DC is the one place where people cheer for Team Cable. This would be a clusterfuck worse than Comcast’s customer service The FCC chairman — and the phone and cable companies that are supporting his proposal — will say they’re actually keeping the internet open, but hundreds of tech companies, countless venture investors, and millions of people see right through it. The FCC’s proposal would explicitly create a pay-to-play internet, a dangerous proposition that threatens the internet you and I love so much.

Two units will be tested: the Vievu, a clip-on camera shaped like a pager which is worn on the front of an officer's shirt, and the Taser, which The Verge profiled in a lengthy report, and is worn on the ear, glasses, collar, or shoulder. The NYPD says that the cameras are being tested in response to the controversy over its Stop and Frisk policies, the practice of routinely stopping, questioning, and patting down civilians who officers consider suspicious but who have not committed any overt crime. Civil rights groups have challenged this policy in court, and the NYPD has recently moved to reduce the frequency of Stop and Frisk after a judge declared the practice unconstitutional. Bratton told The Wall Street Journal he hopes the cameras will de-escalate confrontations between citizens and police and put an end to the ""'he said, she said' controversy."" The Taser is designed to be continuously recording video, in 30-second segments, without audio. An officer can tap it to trigger longer recording.

Who doesn’t want to curl up on a blanket surrounded by famous dead people and watch Close Encounters of the Third Kind? Slot machines used to be a sideshow to casinos' table games. Now, they're the main attractions. Here's how the companies that make slot machines have engineered the perfectly addictive products — and how their knowledge is starting to move on to mobile games. If flying a plane for five days straight without any backup sounds difficult, well, it should. The high-stakes endurance feat is part of a plan to circle the globe in one of the most ambitious planes ever built — one entirely powered by the sun.

They may have a more lavish set on the street, but it’s still real for a lot of cats out here in the entertainment game. We’re okay, but we’re not rich, and that’s what I wanted to display to my fans... I always try and think about what the 'hood would say when I do things. DeadspinDiana Moskovitz reports on the ways in which the Las Vegas judicial system prevented Floyd Mayweather from seeing any consequences for his history of domestic abuse. By far the lengthiest file I got—a full 18 pages—was from 2011, when Floyd was charged with two counts of misdemeanor harassment after threatening two security guards over parking tickets. The criminal complaint said Mayweather told them that his crew had guns and Mayweather would call them to come over and “take care of” them.” Mayweather was found not guilty, although not before Mayweather’s legal team offered a bizarre solution, one guard told the Las Vegas Review-Journal: Would the guard want the case dismissed if in return Mayweather “apologized, shook his hand and gave him tickets to his next fight”? (He declined.) The New Yorker Monica Heisey imagines Pinterest as a person. Back in her kitchen, she starts the evening’s work: repurposing things. She repurposes a chandelier into a centerpiece, an unwanted blanket into a whimsical teepee, a large can into a slightly smaller can. It feels good to recycle. “Come at me, Martha Stewart. I freaking dare you,” Pinterest thinks, as she paints the final chevron on what used to be a useless old ladder. Now it’s a cool ladder. She lights a few homemade beeswax tapers. She takes one to her fire pit and ritualistically burns many copies of House & Garden. The light flickers across the metallic temporary tattoos she has applied to her collarbone as a fun, affordable twist on glitzy jewelry.

You can check out this week's 14 best trailers below.    There are a lot of reasons to be wary about anything coming from the Wachowskis, but I'd be surprised if anyone who loves The Matrix isn't still holding out hope for what they can do. That makes this first trailer for Sense8 some good news. It's wild. It's sprawling. It's mixing myth, science fiction, and martial arts. And it looks cool. It's out on Netflix beginning June 5th.   After more than 30 years, National Lampoon's Vacation is getting a reboot / continuation, and its first trailer arrived this week. Chevy Chase cameos, but this time around Ed Helms and Christina Applegate are the stars. The trailer certainly has its moments, including one wonderfully meta discussion. It'll be out July 29th.   I didn't see the first Magic Mike, but the trailer for its sequel is so ridiculous and funny that I have to assume I'm missing out. Seriously, don't skip this. It'll be out July 1st.   This doesn't seem like the smartest comedy in the world, but it puts some great comedians in a situation to have a lot of fun. Absolutely Anything has a group of aliens, voiced by members of Monty Python, granting Simon Pegg's character the ability to make anything he wants come true. There's also a dog voiced by Robin Williams. It comes out in the UK on August 14th.   Of course we're going to be interested when Ian McKellen is playing Sherlock Holmes. This new trailer dives into the film's interesting premise: that Holmes is dealing with the grand impression everyone has of him because of Watson's stories. That said, you might want to stop watching about halfway through — it seems like this trailer might cover a lot of the movie. It'll be out in the US on July 17th.   If there's one must-watch trailer this week, it's got to be this one. Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet is a gorgeous animated film that flows through a number of different styles and original music as it tells the story of a young girl and her friendship with a man imprisoned for his poetry, all based on Gibran's work. Quvenzhané Wallis and Liam Neeson are the voice-acting stars, and it's directed by Roger Allers, who co-directed The Lion King. The Prophet will be out August 7th.   This is what Hugh Jackman does when he isn't wearing Adamantium claws. The documentary Dukale's Dream follows Jackman as he visits coffee farmers in Ethiopia, investigating how fair-trade beans can help reduce global poverty. It'll be in some theaters June 5th and on-demand July 14th.   The Nightmare is a documentary, but it might be as scary as any horror film. The movie looks at people who suffer from sleep paralysis and find themselves stuck in nightmares as they lay somewhere between being asleep and awake. It looks surprisingly frightening, and it'll be in theaters and on-demand starting June 5th.   Even in the little that it dives into in this two-minute trailer, An Open Secret is chilling. The documentary dives into the many allegations of sexual abuse of Hollywood child stars. It opens in the US on June 5th.   Joshua Oppenheimer’s followup to The Act of Killing, his 2012 documentary about the 1965 Indonesian genocide, continues the story with a look at a man who is now addressing his brother's killers. The Look of Silence already seems like it's bound to be just as powerful of a documentary. It'll be out July 17th.   This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Grateful Dead's founding, and Netflix is taking a look back with a documentary about bandleader Bob Weir. The documentary is supposed to be more than a fun trip back through a cultural phenomenon — it dives into the friendship between Weir and bandmate Jerry Garcia as well. It'll be out two weeks from now, on May 22nd.   Jack Black and Tim Robbins star in HBO's newest comedy. The Brink has them playing inept, inappropriate, and generally ridiculous government officials dealing a political crisis in Pakistan. It certainly looks like they're running with the setup in as wild of a way possible. The show premieres June 21st.   Unexpected got good reviews out of Sundance, and now it's head to theaters in July. The film focuses on two women, a teacher and her student, who both get pregnant... unexpectedly. The film is a comedy, but it's also about how two people in two very different places in their lives deal with the prospect of becoming a mother. It'll be out July 24th.   It's hard to be more of a sex comedy than this. The Little Death is a comedy about five couples and their sexual issues, encounters, and private desires. Is there a bigger story to this movie?

Strong reviews outweighed weak ratings While Carter was never the strongest show in the ratings, it did earn praise from critics while building a loyal fanbase. Starring Hayley Atwell, the series follows the eponymous Peggy Carter — first introduced in Captain America: The First Avenger — in the years after World War II. Fans have responded well to Carter's being a strong woman, as she must balance work at SHIELD's precursor, the Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR), along with unraveling a plot concerning Howard Stark. Along with Daredevil, the show is widely regarded as the best TV show in Marvel's ever-expanding stable. Agents of SHIELD has been a bigger ratings success than Carter, though it took longer to garner positive reviews.

It’s a deft, thought-provoking piece of filmmaking that asks tough questions about technology, gender, and — like some of the very best science fiction — the inherent deficiencies in human nature itself. At the center of it all is the relationship between two characters: a shy programmer named Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) and a robot named Ava (Alicia Vikander), who may represent the first example of truly sentient artificial intelligence.   With so much of the film riding on the dynamic between the two, the visual effects team had to make sure that Ava was immediately believable as a machine without letting design or technique get in the way of Vikander’s nuanced performance. The result is nothing short of a marvel. On the eve of the film’s expansion into even more US theaters, I spoke with visual effects supervisor Andrew Whitehurst about how they were able to tackle the challenge. Bryan Bishop: Let’s talk about making Ava. Other than the restrictions with budget and time, what were the biggest challenges? Andrew Whitehurst: I think there’s a sort of film historical precedent issue, which is we didn’t want Ava to look obviously like a robot from any other film that people would be used to seeing. The C-3POs, and Maria from Metropolis; that kind of thing. I made a rule which I applied to myself as much as anybody else who was on the team working on it, which was no one is allowed to look at robots. We did get a whole bunch of reference images of sculptures, by Constantin Brâncuși, who did these sort of very organic, yet almost mechanical, modernist sculptures. And things like Formula 1 car racing suspension. Anything where strength and weight was a big issue in the design of them. And we used that, plus human anatomy, as a kind of starting point when we were beginning to physically build her. When Alex came to [visual effects company] Double Negative, he’d already been working with a comic book artist named Jock who’s done awesome work. I’ve always loved his stuff, so it was great seeing fresh pictures from him. And they’d come to us with some designs and some ideas, which we then worked up as we were discussing the practicalities of what could and couldn’t be built from the painted concepts. You get to a point with concept paintings when you have to say alright, this is as far as we can push a painting, and now we actually need to start building something tangible. It was [being built] in the computer, but it has form and solidity. Because with paintings, you can hide a lot in the brushwork. You can do a little brush stroke that suggests something, but it’s not discrete, and when you’re building something for real it has to be entirely discrete. Overall, I think the approach to Ava was that iterative design approach, but she had to be mechanically plausible as well. A lot of times when you see robots, particularly in movies and you’re doing it with CG, you can cheat like hell. You can have things that will intersect ... you can get away with murder. I was absolutely determined that we wouldn’t do that. If it’s a film that has a slightly more fantastic aspect to it, it’s fine. But Ava as a character and as an entity on screen had to be entirely plausible to me to work. So I wanted to make sure when we were designing her that everything was functioning, plausible, and everything was in the right place. The validation of that was that a large chunk of Ava was 3D printed for a scene that takes place in the laboratory where she’s constructed, and when they 3D printed it, it all slotted together, and it all articulated properly. That’s something that most movie viewers, they don’t consciously notice it, but I think if we had cheated something about it wouldn’t have felt quite right. And I think that would have undermined what we were setting out to achieve. It's a difficult balance to strike, because the audience has to understand she’s a robot, but for the movie to work that idea then needs to fall away, in the same way it does for Caleb. Exactly. We also put a lot of effort into things like the muscles contracting properly, and the various pipes and wiring having just a tiny amount of jiggle. And it’s something that you really do not notice. But I remember when we were looking at shots, for whatever reason when we put a shot through to render overnight that secondary animation hadn’t rendered properly, so it was missing. And everything suddenly felt very stiff. And you kick the shot off again, this time with that animation integrated into it, and it works again. It’s not something that you can necessarily put your finger on as being wrong, but if it’s missing then you suddenly feel that something’s strange. So much of visual effects is psychology more than anything else. You’re looking at what are the cues that we as humans latch onto when we look at something that makes it feel right. And it’s often those really kind of subtle things that help ultimately push it that last few percent to really sell the illusion. How many VFX shots were in the movie overall? Overall I think it was about 800, 350 or so of which were robot shots. ... But I think the thing that is notable — I mean, that's not a particularly high shot count by modern visual effects standards, but this film has many fewer shots in it. The average shot is probably about eight seconds long, which when you consider most action films, you're talking about shots that are often less than a second. The number of shots may be lower but the actual number of frames is pretty high just because each of those shots plays out for quite a while. I’m curious about how you shot the Ava scenes. It’s my understanding that you didn’t go the greenscreen route, or have Alicia Vikander’s face covered in crazy motion capture dots or anything. No. It was the first film I’ve ever done where we did not put a single greenscreen up. The key thing about the film fundamentally is that it is a series of conversations. And for those conversations to work and be engaging, you have to have two actors that are talking to each other, and then the audience can get involved in that conversation. And if that doesn’t work, it doesn’t matter what the visual effects do. You’re screwed, because there is no drama there. So we knew we had to let Alex and Rob [Hardy, the cinematographer] shoot it as they would shoot any dialogue scene with two actors sitting there, and that’s what was on set. Alicia was wearing a costume that was mostly made of that grey mesh you see in her shoulders and upper torso area — she had a kind of catsuit that was made out of that kind of material. But the scenes had to be shot as if they were a regular dialogue scene, mostly because you needed to have that interaction between the actors. So you couldn’t use motion capture, for example. But the other reason was we had a six-week shoot, so we were doing between 15 and 25 set-ups a day which is a hell of a lot to shoot for a movie. That’s really motoring. And if you’re [constantly] saying, ""Oh we need to put greenscreens up,"" or, ""Oh we need to do a motion control or motion capture shoot,"" there just isn’t the time. You have to be fast, and you have to be very flexible. So the approach that we came up with was ""shoot the scene however you want, take as long as you want."" When [Garland was] finished doing a set-up, we asked the actors to step out, and then we shot a clean pass where was asked the camera operator to mimic as closely as she could the movement that she’d done when the actors were actually there, and that gave us a clean plate. And then when we got into post-production we could track both versions of the shot — the one where she’s in there, and the one where she isn’t — and then paint her out and restore the background behind her, which was a very painstaking process. And then we could begin to body-track her performance, so we could capture as closely as we possibly could exactly what she was doing on set. Then we used that animation data to drive our robot. So the physical movement of her is all Alicia, and the face, the hands, the feet are photographic in 99 percent of the shots. It meant a lot of work for us in terms of painting clean plates. But I think what we gained out of it was vastly more important, which is you got that sense of the drama played out, and we were able to shoot at speed which was absolutely crucial. During a lot of the movie Ava is very still and static, which I imagine was easier for your team versus the moments where she’s more active? No, quite the opposite! The hardest stuff to track is when someone is not moving. Because nobody is not moving, they’re moving but really, really subtlely. The easiest thing to track is when she’s running down a corridor or something like that. That’s much easier to do. Probably the single hardest shot — there’s a shot in the film where she’s holding out a drawing for Caleb to look at. It’s a tracking shot, and it’s 1,600 frames long. She’s literally just sitting there holding a drawing out and talking. If you just held your hand out and looked at it against something that isn’t moving, you’ll be aware of the tiny, subtle movements you’ll be doing even if you’re trying to hold your hand still. We were then trying to exactly copy that, and it was brutally hard. The hardest job on the entire show, I think, was body tracking Alicia, and particularly in those shots where she wasn’t moving much. You’ve worked on some very big movies in the past. Was the idea of working on something smaller and more intimate like Ex Machina particularly intriguing? Yeah, absolutely. I'd just worked on Skyfall before I started doing Ex Machina, which was obviously a considerably larger enterprise. There's pluses and minuses to working on bigger and smaller shows. I don't think you can necessarily say that one's better than the other, but they have different qualities. Certainly one of the big appeals of working on something like Ex Machina was that it was a small team of people, all of whom knew that we had to work together very closely, because it's the only way that you can make something work on a low budget, is if everybody agrees what the end goal needs to be and then everybody goes and works like hell to go and achieve that. I think with a small show, with a fewer number of people, you're a bit lighter on your feet, so you can make bigger decisions quicker, and you can change things and react to things a little bit faster. It was a short shoot. We only shot for six weeks, I think, whereas for a Bond film it's a six-, seven-month shoot. So everything had an energy to it and a pace to it, which was a really lovely way of working. And the other plus was that I genuinely could not have asked for a better group of people to work with. Both internally at DNA [Films, the production company] and Alex, and Rob Hardy the DP, and Sammy [Sheldon] who did the costumes, and Mark [Day] who edited it. It's just a really awesome bunch of people. Ex Machina is now playing.

As Walt Mossberg wrote at Recode, it's an impressive if slightly confusing first cut at a full-featured music streaming service. After you get through the usual Terms of Service agreements that you won't read, you're dropped into the classic Beats Music interface that lets you choose your favorite genres and artists. I did my level best to get my late '90s and early aughts bands to show up there, but only a handful did. Perhaps Apple has better taste in music than I do (Apple probably has better taste in music than I do). After that, you get your five tabs. It starts with ""For You,"" which presents music largely based on the choices you just made. It's a mix of Apple-curated playlists and bands it figures you'll like — and the fact that it dropped deep Flaming Lips cuts with Grizzly Bear's Yellow House pretty much means it nailed what my music tastes are / were the last time I heavily used iTunes, in the days before Rdio and Spotify. But here's Apple Music in a nutshell: it's ambitious. It borrows ideas from nearly everybody: it has a clean UI like Rdio, a massive catalog like Spotify, a lot of music management buttons like iTunes, and human curation like Beats. The next tab is ""New,"" and it does exactly what it says on the tin: there are artists, music videos, and specific songs it thinks you might like. Drill into the ""Apple Music Editors"" section and the app presents you with panoramic images for different genres that lead to playlists and songs within that genre. And here's where it starts to get just a little confusing. Keeping your sense of place within the app can become difficult as you tap and swipe around. There are ever-present three-dot buttons that pop up menus that let you follow things like genres or artists, add stuff to your own music library, or add to an ""Up Next"" music queue. Some of that is going to be inevitable: trying to cram a classic iTunes-style music library, a full-featured music discovery service, and a radio station all into one app is a very tall order — and to be honest, the fact that Apple made it as clear as it did is impressive. It doesn't take too long to get the basic UI, and even if you get lost deep in some section, you can usually swipe back to find your place. A few taps is usually all it takes to find what you want, but you'll find yourself hitting that three-dot menu a lot to make stuff available offline and generally try to manage your library. That extends to the Now Playing UI, which defaults to a small bar that persists at the bottom that extends up to show you more information about what you're listening to. There's a button for your music queue, a star that lets you tell Apple Music to ""play more like this"" and all the rest of the usual music controls. On many of the songs I played, I could tap the album art to see the lyrics for the song I was listening to. You can swipe down to minimize the full-screen player, which means the play / pause button turns into a surprisingly small target to hit. Moving on: the Radio tab is where Apple Music Radio (neé iTunes Radio) lives, with its curated, genre-specific radio stations. (As of this writing, Beats One just officially launched after playing a bunch of Brian Eno for the first hour. DJ Zane Lowe has decided that he ought to insert his voice into the beginning of each song he plays. He also has high praise for Beck.) In a station, that star button becomes a heart, a signal to Apple you like a song and want to hear more like it. Connect, the tiny little musician Tumblr inside Apple Music, is more of a mixed bag. I suppose if I were a superfan of a particular band or artist I might enjoy Rufus Wainwright welcoming me to Connect more. If nothing else, as of right now it looks like somebody at Apple is heavily moderating the comments. You'd expect an open comment section on a global music service to be a mess, but it isn't (yet?). For what it's worth, my comment of ""Hi Rufus"" appeared right away. Somehow I'm following 106 artists already, so maybe if enough of them take advantage of Connect I'll run into some happy discoveries there. And the last tab: My Music. It works like the old music, basically, but the old tabs you're used to have been variously moved and buried into different places in the UI. Some of the stuff you've already learned how to do on the iPhone, like making a playlist, requires hunting down a little ""new"" button. Try as I might I couldn't find the place to tap to find more music from an artist that's already in my library. That sent me to the search button, which thankfully has a clear set of tabs which lets you know whether you're searching your own music or the full Apple Music corpus.   There's more to say (and we'll say it in our full review), but our first impressions are that although there are some unavoidable places where you can get lost, Apple Music has pulled off the basics of what you'd expect from a streaming music service. You can find the music you want (including, yes, Taylor Swift), and if you just want Apple's curators to help you stop being An Old who only listens to Built to Spill because he stopped paying attention to music 10 years ago, you can do that, too.

Things like Sony's Cyber-shot QX series or the DxO One give you better lenses and bigger sensors, and still let you shoot with your phone so you can quickly share the results. Earlier this year, Olympus announced its own solution — the Air — but it was only available in Japan.  Today, Olympus has announced that the Air is being released in the United States and Canada. The Air will hit US store shelves in July with $299 (body only) and $499 (with a 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens) options.  It will be available in Canada in August.    Inside the Air is a 16-megapixel Micro Four Thirds sensor, similar to what you'd find in mirrorless cameras of a similar price. The battery isn't replaceable, and will last around 320 shots. The camera connects to both iOS and Android devices via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and you're meant to use your device to review your photos and as the camera's viewfinder. While you can transfer images to your phone, the Air does use a microSD card for storage. It can shoot RAW or JPEG images, offers manual and auto focus (with face detection), and can capture video at a resulution of 1080p. Basically, you'll find anything you would want out of a point-and-shoot camera on the Olympus Air. There's an extendable clip on the back that lets you snap the Air right to your phone, or you can take advantage of the wireless connection and set up a more creative shot by moving the camera around independently. But the coolest thing about the Air is you can mount it directly on any Micro Four Thirds lens. For relatively cheap, the Air gives you access to a huge system of interchangeable lenses.   It's totally right to question how useful that feature is, though. If you're carrying around a set of hefty lenses, you probably have space for a camera body that's Wi-Fi-enabled and not something that requires your phone and a tenuous Bluetooth connection. The Air worked fairly well in the few minutes I had with the camera. It paired quickly, and photos taken with the Air showed up on the phone within about one second. While the Air can shoot up to 10 frames per second in burst mode, the experience never feels fast.

More than anything else, he wants current deals reexamined. SpaceX will issue a filing with the US Court of Federal Claims over the Air Force's contracting procedures, which Musk believes are unfair. ""Let’s shine some sunlight on this,"" he said during a conference call. ""As I’ve said, sunlight is the best disinfectant. If everything’s fine, then I guess that’s great. But that seems unlikely to me."" Musk said it would be ""in the best interest of the American public"" for the Air Force to cancel the 36-core contract that the ULA successfully bid on, wait until SpaceX receives its formal certification, and then conduct a legitimate competition to see which company truly deserves the deal. That's obviously a rosy scenario for Musk and his SpaceX colleagues, but one Boeing and Lockheed will quickly object to. Musk says if SpaceX is good enough for NASA, it's good enough to handle national security The ULA — which was formed when Boeing and Lockheed combined their government launch efforts — currently pulls in up to $3.5 billion in annual funding from the government, according to a handout distributed at a SpaceX media event today. Musk seems confident SpaceX can do much better — and for less. ""What we feel is that this is not right. That the national security launches should be put up for competition,"" Musk said. SpaceX is perfectly capable of launching NASA satellites and ""every satellite you can imagine,"" so there's no logical reason why it shouldn't be able to handle putting sensitive GPS satellites in orbit. ""With SpaceX, the government could generate at least $1B in savings annually, even under the most conservative estimates,"" the company said today. SpaceX is also trying to highlight just how far that money can go: it could fund an entire year's worth of operations for 12 F-16 squadrons, for example. This has been a project that Musk has been working on for some time. In March, he testified before the US Senate against the ULA.

The method, which involves introducing fecal matter from a healthy donor into the gut of an unhealthy donor, has a 90 percent success rate, so its increasing popularity should come as no surprise. Perhaps more surprising is that, until now, few researchers have tried to freeze donated stool to see if it works as well as the fresh kind. Fortunately, a group of researchers at the Massachusetts General Hospital have given it the old clinical study try. And — lo and behold — frozen poo works, too.  C. difficile is a serious infection that kills 14,000 people in the US each year. Symptoms can range from diarrhea to serious inflammation of the colon. And unfortunately, 30 percent of patients experience recurrent infections. Treating the infection with antibiotics can work, but there's always a chance that these medications could make the infection worse by killing off healthy gut bacteria. Doctors have turned to fecal matter to cure C. difficile infections because it's thought that stool transplants help restore healthy microbes in a patient's gut. But the procedure has one major drawback: it's pretty time sensitive. It's pretty time sensitive Elizabeth Hohmann,  an infectious disease expert at the Massachusetts General Hospital who worked on the study, published today in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, explained in an email to The Verge that ""we like to treat patients for at least four days with vancomycin — an antibiotic — at the time of [C. difficile] relapse."" After these four days, the physicians stop the vancomycin treatment for a short period and then proceed with the transplant. This, Hohmann said, can be a ""challenging time frame for a patient to 'find their own donor' and get that person tested."" People can't eat allergens in the days leading up to the donation Furthermore, if a donor has eaten common allergens — such as nuts and eggs — in the days prior to the donation, their fecal matter won't be suitable for some patients. In short, the whole process can end up taking much longer than it should, which can compromise the treatment's effectiveness. Freezing donations could therefore provide physicians with more flexibility. As the study shows, frozen, prescreened fecal matter from a donor who is unrelated to a patient is just as effective in curing recurrent C. difficile infections as a fresh stool sample. In the experiment, doctors obtained fecal matter from what the researchers called ""exceptionally healthy adults"" who refrained from eating common allergens in the days leading up to donation. The feces were then filtered and diluted before being screened for hazardous microbes and frozen. Finally, researchers re-tested the donors in the four weeks following the donation to make sure that they didn't have any hidden infections at the time of the screening. 20 patients received thawed donations Once the researchers were satisfied with the donors and their samples, they introduced the thawed fecal matter into the guts of 17 adults and three children who had experienced at least three bouts of mild to moderate C. difficile infections. Half the donors received the fecal matter through gastrointestinal tubes, whereas the other half received it by way of colonoscopy. The researchers found that a single dose of thawed fecal matter was enough to cure 14 out of the 20 study participants. Five of the remaining six participants received a second treatment, and four were cured — a result that amounts to an overall success rate of 90 percent. Given the small sample size, the doctors repeated the trial with an additional set of 11 patients. Once again, they obtained a success rate of 90 percent. One patient was self-administering fecal enemas They're now investigating whether it might be possible to administer the donations in capsules that would remain intact until they reached the small intestine. Such a delivery method would, for obvious reasons, likely be preferred by patients. As for the participant who declined to receive a second treatment, researchers said they later discovered that he had been self-administering fecal enemas, using donations from his roommate. ""Some people are undertaking this at home for a variety of medical purposes,"" Hohmann said. ""There's a lot about it on the internet."" But DIY fecal transplants should be avoided, she said, because feces obtained from people in one's entourage aren't screened for hazardous microbes — and that friendly, neighborhood donor might not be as healthy as a patient would like to think.",0.3117661051320715,0.6882338948679285,0.8417279126332758,766,5.1879895561357703,400,6.2024999999999997,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That estimate is equivalent to roughly 3.2 million children. Furthermore, the CDC reports that nearly 8 percent of children whose parents are members of the US military and 9.2 percent of children from families with incomes below the poverty line take prescription drugs for these same problems. ""difficulties with emotions, concentration behavior, and being able to get along with others."" Unfortunately, the report does not state what these medications are. ""The survey doesn't ask questions on specific types of medications, so we don't know the types that they are using,"" says LaJeana Howie, a CDC statistician who worked on the report. The survey defined behavioral and emotional difficulties as ""difficulties with emotions, concentration behavior, and being able to get along with others,"" Howie explains. It's therefore likely that drugs that are used to treat ADHD, anxiety, and depression represent a large percentage of these medications. The study also makes it difficult to determine whether the overall percentage of children on prescription drugs is higher, lower, or equivalent to previous estimates, because the last such report — a 2005 study that estimate that 5 percent of kids were taking prescription drugs for these same problems — also included four- to five-year-olds. This change in age brackets, Howie says, means that ""we don't have a direct data comparison for previous years."" But Christopher Bellonci, a child psychiatrist at Tufts University who did not participate in the CDC study, argues that ""the trend is that the older kids are on more medication, so you would expect that there would be a lower prescribing rate in the four- to five-years-olds."" Taking these younger children into account might therefore lower the overall percentage. But given that the diagnostic rates for these conditions have been increasing in recent years, Bellonci says, it might not bring the overall percentage down to the previous 5 percent.  military children face increased risk for emotional and behavioral difficulties The report also raises questions about children of military service members. According to the survey, nearly 8 percent of children on military healthcare, called Tricare, took prescription medications for behavioral difficulties in 2011. ""The military insurance — that's a pretty high rate,"" Bellonci says. ""There is growing concern about the impact of two wars, extended deployment, and now trying to incorporate people who were in war zones back into society."" These parents carry a significant burden of trauma, Bellonci says, ""and this has an impact on their children.""  Bellonci's claims are backed by numerous studies that have reported that children whose parents are in the military face increased risk for a number of emotional and behavioral difficulties, including those that can lead to suicide. Parental satisfaction with the medications was included in the survey as well. ""We found that over 50 percent of the parents perceived that this medication was helping a lot,"" Howie said, ""I think that's good news."" But William Graf, a pediatric neurologist at Yale University who did not participate in the survey, sees things differently. Looking at the results for children below the poverty line, Graf pointed out in an email to The Verge that only 43 percent of parents said they thought the drugs were helping their kids. So, if parents are the best judge of their children, and their satisfaction with the treatment implies that the medication is effective and the diagnosis is accurate, he said, ""then these data would suggest over-diagnosis and medication overuse in low-income children and adolescents compared to higher income populations.""  ""medications are being prescribed in lieu of other social interventions."" ""It not just overprescribing though, it's also under-treating,"" explains Bellonci, ""because you have kids where medications are being prescribed in lieu of other social interventions"" or non-medicinal treatments, he says, such as therapy.

Light shone on the material creates a positive or negative charge, inducing the crystals into specified shapes.  To demonstrate its capabilities, the researchers at the university used light to project an M onto the material. The crystals are shown to coalesce into shape quickly, copying it, before floating back to their neutral positions.

That's a bit of advice from Aditya Khosla, a PhD candidate at MIT's prestigious Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab. Khosla, who previously came up with an algorithm to help actors tweak their headshots to make them more memorable, has crunched through 2.3 million Flickr photos in order to isolate the factors that make a photo popular. Khosla says his algorithm allows him to predict how many views your photo will get before you even upload it. The algorithm considers social factors such as how many followers a user has, the number of tags on the photo, and the length of the title. It also measures content factors such as texture, color, gradient, and objects present in the photo. (Miniskirts, bright colors, people instead of scenery = good. Plungers = bad. Pink and yellow miniskirts, even better. Green plungers, horrible.)  Predictions of popularity using the gradient-based image predictor and actual popularity. The green and red background colors represent correct and false predictions. You can assess your unpublished photos using a rudimentary tool on Khosla's website that measures the potential popularity on a relative scale from one to 10. ""It actually represents how many views are expected on your image per day, on average, but in a log scale,"" Khosla tells The Verge. ""What this means: if the score is 5, we expect roughly 2^5 = 32 views on your image per day, or if its 6, roughly 2^6 = 64. However, this metric is not entirely accurate, and the most important thing is the relative score i.e. if A has score higher than B, it's likely to receive more views."" Right now the algorithm is much better when social factors are included, but Khosla hopes to improve it.

""I tried to build some of my own stuff to teach kids about the electromagnetic spectrum,"" says Ginger Butcher, who leads education and outreach for NASA’s Aura Mission, which has been studying Earth’s atmosphere since 2004. ""But I had to solder it myself, which meant it was pretty expensive. And would break a lot."" Last year Butcher saw a TED talk from Ayah Bdeir, the founder and CEO of LittleBits, a hardware startup based in New York City. The company sells kits of circuit blocks that snap together with magnets — no soldering, wiring, or programming required — and can be combined to fashion millions of different gadgets, from synthesizers to remote control cars. Butcher reached out to Bdeir and asked if they could partner on a collection of NASA-inspired blocks. The result, released today, is called the Space Kit. It comes with 12 ""bit modules"" that provide things like power, remote triggering, light sensing, and motorization. In collaboration with NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, LittleBits also came up with 10 activities that allow users to build everything from a satellite dish to a miniature Mars Rover. The kit costs $189 and goes on sale today at LittleBits' website.  Crafting a Mars Rover requires a few arts and crafts items not included in the Space Kit — scissors, tape, and paper tube — but the pre-fab blocks are a snap compared to what NASA was using for its earlier lessons, when Butcher was jury rigging equipment herself.  ""It takes this complex science and makes it fun and accessible,"" says Butcher. ""To make playing with electronics more like playing with Legos."" The Aura project for example, which is Butcher’s focus, captures images of all kinds of atmospheric conditions: everything from the holes in our ozone layer to the chemical weather patterns that are key to understanding air quality on the ground. Giving kids a sense of how this research worked and why it's important had been a challenge. ""Finally with these activities we have a great way to show how we make these measurements, and it’s something hands on,"" says Butcher. LittleBits sees itself as part of the larger Maker movement, a tech-focused DIY culture that encourages people to build and experiment with their own gadgets. ""Our mission is really to allow anyone to create their own hardware, to make playing with electronics more like playing with Legos,"" says LittleBits’ Bdeir. Born in Beirut and educated as an engineer, Bdeir eventually found her way to the famed MIT Media Lab. There she fused her mathematical pedigree with a love of arts and culture, working on the first prototypes of blocks that could be combined by amateurs to create interesting circuits.    She founded LittleBits in 2011 and has since raised about $15 million in venture capital. The Space Kit is the company’s third release, following sets focused on music and lighting, and the first one done in collaboration with a major scientific force like NASA. All told the company has now released more than 50 blocks, but Baidr likes to point out that since they are all interoperable, that means there are ""literally tens of millions of possible circuits you could create. From a small number of blocks, you get a whole universe of possibilities.""",0.7504322607488185,0.24956773925118148,0.829582604529953,597,4.9932998324958122,368,5.8913043478260869,0,0,"Science, Tech, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yet these machines are still largely dependent on the existing human structures to which they connect. If a person's nerve endings are damaged, for instance, the usefulness of these machines becomes limited. Scientists might soon be able to overcome these obstacles, however, as researchers were able to use an implant to deliver gene therapy to the auditory portion of a guinea pig's ear — a treatment that not only caused the animal's auditory nerves to regrow, but improved the human-machine interface in the process. The implant sends electrical impulses into surrounding cells In the study, published today in Science Translational Medicine, researchers used an antibiotic treatment to deafen adult guinea pigs. Then, they introduced recombinant DNA — DNA formed in a lab by combining genetic material from various sources  — into the cochlea, the portion of the guinea pigs' ear that transforms vibrations into sound signals. Once the DNA was in place, they implanted the ear with a modified cochlear implant that was able to send short, directed electrical impulses to the surrounding cells, in addition to enhancing the animals' hearing. These impulses are part of a gene therapy technique called ""electroporation"" that allowed the recombinant DNA to enter the cochlear cells and produce neurotrophins, proteins that cause auditory nerve endings to regenerate. ""Our gene therapy is an example for a successful treatment of a condition that is not even caused by a genetic defect,"" says Matthias Klugman, a neuroscientist at the University of New South Wales, in Australia, and a co-author of the study. Thanks to the electrical impulses, the cells close to the implant's electrode were able to manufacture a protein that usually stops being produced after adulthood, Klugman explains. This caused the nerve fibers to grow out to those cells, and hence to the electrodes in the implant. This growth, the researchers say, significantly improved the animals' pitch perception and tonal range. improved pitch perception and tonal range Unfortunately, the production of neurotrophins only lasted a few months, so the method needs to be improved before it can go on to human trials. But Gary Housley, a co-author and neuroscientist also at the University of New South Wales, said in an email to The Verge that the implant might one day help people ""appreciate music and hear in noisy environments."" Housley also said that the technology could be used to improve other medical bionics applications, such as retinal implants and deep brain stimulation, which is used to treat Parkinson's disease. ""Deep brain stimulation uses a small array of electrodes very similar to the cochlear implant array,"" he said, ""so we believe that this could be used to introduce different DNA sequences to very discrete regions of the brain to provide directed gene therapy."" These human-machine interfaces also rely on the cells and nerve endings that surround them, so being able to deliver gene therapy in a selective and directed manner could lead to big improvements — and much more powerful bionics.",0.48492607963286,0.51507392036714,0.8505351859563351,518,5.2393822393822393,275,6.4109090909090911,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It’s early evening on the day of Twitter’s holiday party, and the company’s headquarters are emptying out. Michael Sippey, the company’s vice president of product, is holding office hours in the large dining area next to Twitter’s cafeteria, meeting with members of the Twitter flock to solicit ideas and answer their questions. A few blocks away, the party venue — San Francisco City Hall — has been lit up in Twitter blue for the occasion. Tweets from the event will be hashtagged #celebrate, underscoring the triumphant year the company has just finished. Twitter’s improbable rise culminated in it becoming a public company last month, in an offering that raised $2 billion and firmly established the service as a pillar of the social internet. But while most of the company is relaxing, Sippey is still thinking through the product. There is some reason for concern. Despite its success this year, the company’s user base grew more slowly than it hoped. At the time of its initial public offering, Twitter had 215 million monthly active users, compared with 1.19 billion for rival Facebook. Twitter’s challenge from the start has been familiarizing new users with its core conventions — following, @ replies, hashtags, retweets — and helping them continually discover content that keeps them coming back. An evolving redesign of the company's entire range of products It’s Sippey’s job to make that all easier. Since taking over the product team last summer, he has overseen a reorganization of the company’s development efforts designed to make the company more nimble. That effort has begun to bear fruit: in just the past four months, Twitter has introduced a conversation view that joins tweets and replies with blue lines; inserted image previews into the core timeline; and enabled photos to be sent in direct messages. Then, two weeks ago, the company redesigned its apps for iPhone and Android to let users swipe between different timelines and make messaging more prominent. The result has been an evolving redesign of the company’s entire range of products. In an interview with The Verge, Sippey laid out the philosophy behind the changes — and hinted at the further changes yet to come. More timelines are on their way, and so are more images. Direct messages, after years of neglect, are reclaiming a more prominent place within the product. ""In terms of where we want it go, we’re constantly working on that — constantly,"" Sippey says. ""And you have to continually be revisiting that, because the world changes, consumer behavior changes, the competitive landscape changes. And you want to be able to react to that."" To understand Twitter’s new direction, it helps to remember the way the company used to build software. For most of its life, months would pass between major improvements to the product. It was a consequence of the once-ubiquitous Fail Whale: the company’s engineers were frequently working overtime just to keep the service running. But Twitter faced another hurdle to growing its user base — in a world that was rapidly shifting to mobile devices, its product teams were still focused on the web. Until this year, a team building a new feature for the web would create it in isolation. Later, small iOS and Android teams would be tasked with implementing that feature in their apps. Facebook, notably, once faced a similar problem — it grew up on the web, and took its time adapting to a world dominated by mobile devices. Twitter started on mobile phones, but until recently oriented its product development teams around the web. ""Essentially, what we did was turn that model upside-down,"" Sippey says. Now every team working on a feature includes mobile developers — a strategy that became possible only after the company overhauled its recruiting and training programs. Transformimg employees into mobile developers In April, Twitter bought training company Marakana and had its team build an in-house developer school called Twitter University. The goal: transform more of Twitter’s current employees into mobile developers. ""That’s really accelerated our ability to have great back-end engineers and Java engineers become iOS and Android engineers,"" Sippey says. From there, like Facebook before it, Twitter built an experimentation framework into its apps for iOS and Android. That lets the product team test hypotheses by randomly selecting 1 percent of Twitter users to see how new features change their use of the product. Data drawn from those experiments gave the company new confidence this year as it set out to transform its products — and helped the team start moving faster.  Take conversation view, which Twitter introduced in August to a mixed response. For years, it had been clear that seeing replies scattered around the timeline made Twitter harder to grok. ""We knew through user research that the mechanics of conversation on Twitter were difficult for people,"" Sippey says. ""And we know that one of the best things about Twitter are the conversations! We wanted to make it easy for people to understand that conversations happen on the product, and how they happen."" Twitter built multiple treatments for viewing conversations With its development team stocked with mobile engineers and the experimentation framework in place, Twitter built six or seven different treatments for viewing conversations. One version put replies on top of the original tweet instead of underneath them. Another made replies smaller than the original tweet, to give them a sense of hierarchy. Informed by data from its experiments, Twitter opted to simply link related tweets with a blue line. Some users complained, but the outcry has mostly died down. And Twitter has continued to iterate on the feature, working to make sure users don’t see the same tweet every time new replies trickle in. ""It’s done great things for users and it’s been good for the product,"" Sippey says. ""The timeline is easier to read."" The company applied a similar approach to bringing images inside the timeline. ""We’ve known for a long time that great moments on Twitter typically have a photo with them,"" Sippey says. ""People like pictures."" The question was how to insert them into the timeline in a way that felt natural: ""How do we make sure we maintain the rhythm of reading Twitter?"" Sippey says. ""And also how does it perform, and how does it drive engagement?"" The team experimented with different ways of cropping photos — photos as squares, photos at full height, photos cropped to the height of a text tweet. Ultimately, Twitter settled on a rectangular crop that’s as tall as two text-only tweets. ""We saw in the data that it worked for users,"" Sippey says. What everyone wants to know — and what Sippey declines to say — is how these changes are affecting engagement and user growth, in raw numbers. The most immediate boost to engagement came when the company started showing action buttons (reply, favorite, retweet) without making you first tap a tweet. Sippey expects other changes to boost engagement over time — an indication, perhaps, that they haven’t yet sent it skyrocketing. Twitter is betting that it can change user behavior over time by changing their concept of what the service is. ""As you see more photos in the product, you think of Twitter as a photo product,"" Sippey says. ""Some of these things are investments in the future of where we want the product to go."" ""As you see more photos in the product, you think of Twitter as a photo product."" Another one of those investments in the future is messaging. In 2011, a redesign that came to be known as #newnewtwitter moved direct messages a layer deeper in the interface; the company reportedly once considered eliminating them altogether. With the release of its new mobile apps, DMs are once again front and center. It’s no wonder: messaging apps have exploded in popularity, and WhatsApp alone boasts more than 400 million monthly users. ""It’s always been a great part of the product,"" Sippey says. ""What we want to do is make Twitter a great experience for both public conversation and private conversation — because we think the two complement each other."" The company’s redesigned apps, which it released earlier this month, offer further hints about Twitter’s future. Today you can swipe from your home timeline to Discover, which highlights popular tweets and trending topics, and Activity, which lets you know what the people you follow have been doing on Twitter. The company is already testing a tab called Nearby, which shows you tweets in your area — a service that could make Twitter more useful at a concert, a sporting event, or during an emergency. ""You want to have other experiences, depending on the time of day, or where you are, or if there’s some event happening in the world."" Many other such tabs are possible. ""There are 500 millions tweets that flow through every day,"" Sippey says. ""A lot of what you want to go experience probably isn’t in your home timeline — you can’t follow enough. You want to have other experiences, depending on the time of day, or where you are, or if there’s some event happening in the world. We want to build flexibility into the product to be able to present those collections of tweets to users."" And so the experiments continue. There are now between 30 and 40 tests running inside the mobile apps, informing a development cycle that now releases every month on iOS and every week on Android. As at Google and Facebook, Twitter’s engineers will constantly be looking for new ways to build and retain their audience, and the most successful experiments will become core features of the product. And features are likely to be introduced gradually — a break from the company’s historical approach to redesigns, when it would bundle scores of changes together and introduce them all at once. Part of that is for testing purposes: rolling changes out independently one another makes it easier to assess how each of them impacts engagement. But it’s also designed to reduce the strain on everyone using the product. ""The goal all the time is to make things cognitively simpler for the user,"" Sippey says. ""Doing it this way gives them the opportunity to learn and see the change and adapt to the change while we’re actually making the product better."" The challenge for Twitter lies in finding ways to attract new users that don’t alienate its existing base. And when Twitter users are unhappy, their judgement can be swift and relentless. Recently, an effort to improve the way users can block offensive content backfired when victims’ advocates said the changes would make victims of harassment less safe. Within a day, Twitter had reversed the changes — all that for a feature most people on Twitter have likely never used. One thing people inside and outside the company tend to agree on: Twitter does need to evolve. To realize its vision of a world connected publicly and in real time, it has to grow quickly — and the current version of the product has only gotten it so far. But what will it evolve into, exactly? There are risks in listening too closely to experimental data, which can favor incremental change over bold new visions. Twitter sees itself as a service that makes it easier for people to connect with one another, and to discover what’s happening in the world. But how it gets there is still very much in development. The company didn’t train all those mobile engineers to do nothing. ""Product teams,"" Sippey says, ""like to ship.""",0.6425298303269825,0.3574701696730175,0.8451430953424115,1935,5.0387596899224807,826,6.3292978208232444,0,0,"Apps, Business, Tech, Web, Exclusive, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

After posting a $446 million net loss for Q3 last month, then-CEO and chairman J.T. Wang announced his resignation from Acer, while company founder Stan Shih came out of retirement to take control. Though the CEO position was initially abolished in order to give Shih more direct power, Acer doesn't say why it's quickly moving away from that strategy. It does note, however, that Chen has strong experience in management.

QuizUp lets users pay for experience points that can be exchanged for trophies or used to customize players' profiles. It has plans to monetize by letting companies sponsor certain topics, something it had great success with when promoting films like Twilight and Batman.

According to The Wall Street Journal, UPS, FedEx, and retailers including Amazon, Kohls, Groupon, and Walmart have all been unable to meet promises to deliver packages before the holiday, largely because of an overwhelming and unexpected increase in online shopping. ""The volume of air packages in the UPS system did exceed capacity as demand was much greater than our forecast,"" UPS tells the Journal. While online commerce currently accounts for 6 percent of US retail sales, the Journal reports that the National Retail Federation believes the number shot up to an average of 14 percent of sales for this year's holidays.  Online shopping shot up more than expected Making matters worse, the Journal reports that some retailers even pushed back this year's deadline for guaranteed delivery by Christmas, making them accountable for even more shipments. Though it's not clear exactly how much online shopping increased, it appears to be a good amount: IBM Digital Analytics reportedly measured a 37 percent increase in online shopping year over year for the weekend preceding Christmas, while Forrester Research believes there was a 15 percent boost in online shopping for the holidays — a slight increase over the National Retail Federation's estimates. FedEx tells the Journal that its delays were not significant, though anecdotal reports suggested that deliveries had missed their deadlines. In a statement to the Journal, Amazon suggested that shippers were at fault for the late deliveries, though in an email to Amazon customers, UPS faulted Amazon for not readying and handing over the packages on time. Amazon is refunding shipping charges and offering a $20 gift card to customers with delayed orders, while Kohls — which says that only a small percentage of customers had packages delayed — will reportedly be paying for the entire cost of the delayed orders. Walmart and UPS also tell the Journal that the delays have only impacted a small percentage of customers, though none detailed exactly how many. Groupon reportedly says that it delivered the ""overwhelming majority"" of orders, but is offering a $25 gift card to customers whose deliveries haven't arrived. Forrester Research tells the Journal that delaying packages guaranteed to arrive by Christmas isn't uncommon — usually occurring with around 15 percent of orders. Even if that number didn't rise this year, it may simply impact more people as the volume of online orders rises. A compressed holiday shopping season may also have played a hand in this year's delays. This year, there were six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas — the least amount of time in a decade, reports CNN. While that won't be a problem again next year, there's a good chance retailers will catch on to this holiday's mistakes around underestimating the demand from online shopping.

More than four years later The agreement, which requires approval from a federal judge, covers claims against Halliburton as part of BP's 2012 class action settlement, as well as punitive damages claims on property and in the commercial fishing industry. The agreement also removes Halliburton's liability for compensating members of the 2012 BP settlement. That money is going into a trust, while other parts of the litigation involving companies like BP and rig operator Transocean continue to work their way through appeals.  The settlement is separate from a $200,000 fine the company paid to the US Department of Justice for destroying evidence related to the incident. According to the Justice Department, Halliburton ordered its employees to destroy simulations for structural tolerance of the concrete mix with system of metal collars. The number of collars, as well as the cement mix, could have made the difference in the outcome of the disaster, investigators found. As Bloomberg notes, the settlement does not apply to some state lawsuits against Halliburton. It's also a very small amount when compared with the billions BP has already paid, and could still be on the hook for.

Disney began investigating the matter back in April, and it's easy to see why — there is an obvious resemblance with the Mickey Mouse logo, and since the registration would cover classes of products from toys to BMX bikes, the entertainment giant no doubt feels the need to protect its trademark.

Reddit, Etsy, Foursquare, Kickstarter, Mozilla, Namecheap, Vimeo, and others will observe next Wednesday — September 10th — as a day of action, during which they'll showcase net neutrality issues on their sites and drive visitors to contact the FCC, Congress, and the White House. The protest, like many previous, smaller ones, warns of a potential ""internet fast lane,"" in which ISPs and online services could reach deals for better service and leave the rest of the web behind. Among other things, sites will post banners that mimic a loading wheel to dramatize what a slowed-down internet could look like. Several banners and widgets have been posted ahead of time by Battle for the Net, a project backed by Fight for the Future, Demand Progress (founded by the late internet activist Aaron Swartz), and other nonprofit organizations. While there's not much information on the banners themselves, Battle for the Net backs one of the most popular options for preserving net neutrality: reclassifying broadband under the Title II common carrier laws that regulate phone service. The original Open Internet rules, set in place under the watch of former FCC chair Julius Genachowski, were struck down earlier this year after a judge ruled that the core principles, like stopping ISPs from blocking or degrading the quality of services, treated companies like Verizon too much like common carriers. 'Battle for the Net' wants broadband reclassified as a common carrier Current chair Tom Wheeler has promised to keep net neutrality alive, but his proposal was received relatively poorly when he unveiled it this spring, particularly because it leaves open the possibility of speeding up specific services within ""commercially reasonable"" bounds. This has prompted a major backlash and a number of angry public comments, but if you support the idea of net neutrality, it's less clear how it will be fixed. Wheeler has largely steered clear of Title II reclassification, suggesting that he can use language from this year's court decision to justify it under rules on promoting broadband competition. And critics of Title II argue that it's an overly restrictive solution that gives the FCC too much power over the internet and might still not support net neutrality rules. A ""forked"" version of Battle for the Net, backed by libertarian-leaning group TechFreedom, has dubbed itself ""Don't Break the Internet"" and come out in favor of ""vigilant restraint"" and against Title II. But among net neutrality advocates, Title II is often considered the best way to create Open Internet rules that will stand up in court. No matter what rules Wheeler puts forward, there's a good chance he'll face more lawsuits from ISPs, like the one that killed the last framework. Section 706, the option Wheeler has pursued most strongly, offers a shaky foundation for lasting policy. A third option is to ask Congress to pass a law codifying standard Open Internet rules; although the idea has been floated by lawmakers, some members of Congress have also pushed for a bill explicitly banning net neutrality. The EFF, Public Knowledge, and other groups that are prominent in the net neutrality fight have signed onto the mission of Battle for the Net. The day of action will run through midnight of September 11th, a few days ahead of the FCC comment deadline of September 15th. While it's modeled somewhat on the strategy of the 2012 SOPA blackout, the loading wheel widgets won't actually slow down sites, making it less extreme than that protest — though one company has actually slowed down its site for visitors using FCC IP addresses as part of an earlier protest. Individual companies may do more than the banners; Reddit manager Erik Martin says the site will be gathering comments from members, among other things. The FCC will be using comments to formulate a final proposal for net neutrality, which it previously said it hoped to have in place by the end of 2014.",0.5537417147146038,0.44625828528539624,0.7084079174246165,684,5.1038011695906436,394,6.0913705583756341,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

A glimpse into a world that prefers to stay hidden But several deep dives by security researchers into the secretive online world of stolen nudes paints a very different picture. An underground trade in these high-profile images has been going on for years, and continues today. This leak was likely an aberration, a clueless move from a greedy rookie that exposed a long-hidden ring built around stealing and trading private photos of high-profile women. Disturbingly, according to those with knowledge of the trading rings, these leaked photos represent just the tip of the iceberg, an accidental glimpse into a world that would have preferred to stay buried.  Screenshot of a conversation forwarded to Kaminsky A lengthy blog post from security researcher Dan Kaminsky has some details on what we’re probably looking at: information trading networks on the so called ""darknet"" — a term for private networks where connections are made only between trusted peers — where users exchanged nude images of celebrity targets and built up massive collections over years. You couldn’t buy your way into the group or pay to view images, Kaminsky says. According to members he communicated with, to get in you needed to bring your own stolen material, something new and valuable the group didn’t already have. ""There are a lot more people with money than with the ability to get these goods."" ""There are a lot more people with money than with the ability to get these goods,"" Kaminsky explained. He says the same moral code applies more broadly across a wide range of hacker groups. ""It is absolutely an ethic of a lot of these communities. You need to be trustworthy, and money alone doesn’t buy that. In fact the perception is that if someone shows up and tries to make a lot of money, they are going to blow everything up."" Once inside it was possible to exchange both money and images in trade, but photos were the most valuable commodity. Security research Nik Cubrilovic, who has spent time immersed in the underground world of celebrity nudes and revenge porn, concurs. ""There is still a lot more to be learned here, but the economics are simple — the more famous a celebrity, or the more of a cult following they have, the higher the demand for their nudes. The less nude pictures there are available, the higher the asking price. Conversely, the more widely shared and distributed an image has become, the less valuable it is."" Cubrilovic compares the marketplace to baseball cards. ""Most of the trading rings work not with cash payments for pictures, but through trading image sets. Users would compare their lists of sets and then come to an agreement to exchange one for another. This way the traders and collectors each build up their image sets over time and they have an incentive to go out and find new sources of rips."" ""It appears the intention was to never make these images public."" So who broke ranks and why? Cubrilovic has a well-written theory for how things fell apart. ""It appears the intention was to never make these images public, but that somebody — possibly the previously identified distributor — decided that the opportunity to make some money was too good to pass up and decided to try to sell some of the images.""  Cubrilovic tracked down posts on AnonIB offering high-profile nudes dating back to five days before the story broke into public view, but nobody took the seller seriously until the uncensored proof hit 4chan, after which it spread across the web like wildfire. From there, more and more images began to spill out. ""My theory is that other members of the ring, seeing the leaks and requests for money also decided to attempt to cash in, thinking the value of the images would soon approach zero, which lead to a race to the bottom between those who had access to them."" There is a world of pay-to-play hacking, where someone delivers personal data like names, birthdays, emails, passwords, and social security numbers to a hacker who then breaks into the account and steals as much data as possible. This seems to have been common practice on AnonIB, the site where the celebrity nudes first came into public view, but it is a distinct phenomenon from the world of hacking and trading in high-profile images of stars, where it appears money changing hands was less common than pure barter. ""Most members of these rings are not financially motivated."" ""Most members of these rings are not financially motivated. That they have been in operation for so long yet not revealed themselves publicly speaks to that,"" says Cubrilovic. ""We only found out about them in this latest case because one member got greedy and decided to attempt to cash in on the latest haul."" In fact, not only do these traders not profit, they actually spend money to keep the marketplace up and running. ""There are members of the ring who invest their own funds into servers and services that are required to operate the networks —such as paying for personal data lookups using online people and credit-report directories."" There is a certain irony to the idea that there was never much monetary value to these celebrity images, as the people hawking the images on AnonIB found out. A paparazzi photographer can use a telephoto lens to take photos of a bikini-clad Kate Middleton, which are worth six figures, and run them in magazines sold in grocery stores and airport bookshops. Relatively tame photos of Jennifer Lawrence smooching her then-boyfriend Nicholas Hoult reportedly fetched $400,000. But those same tabloids can’t run images obtained through illegal hacking, and they certainly wouldn’t publish images that constitute child pornography, which some of these images do. The leaked pictures were valuable only so long as they stayed hidden within these underground trading networks, where they could be exchanged for a few hundred dollars in bitcoin, other stolen nudes, and access to the community itself. Far less scandalous images are ironically also more valuable These invasions are all the more disturbing because they were probably happening long before the victims ever noticed. There was no public market for these images, so they likely circulated in private for months or even years before accidentally breaking into public view. And researchers say there may be a far greater number of images from other celebrities that have yet to be exposed. Messages from some of the underground boards Kaminsky studied mentioned returning to compromised accounts again and again to harvest new photos. ""This is one of the major stories in all of information security over the last decade,"" says Kaminsky. ""You don’t smash your way in and make a big noise grabbing everything you can and selling it. You look to establish a persistent threat. That is an important thing for people to realize, you don’t know when you’ve been hit, and they will come back and visit you again and again.""",0.633206705021655,0.366793294978345,0.8433172822318823,1243,4.950120675784393,586,6.162116040955631,0,0,"Culture, Policy & Law, US & World, Web, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Some officers wore them to a protest on Saturday, though Jackson says the department is ""still playing with them."" Supporters of on-body cameras say they could provide authorities with a clear and unfiltered record of police interactions with civilians. Brown's death, at the hands of Ferguson officer Darren Wilson, and the department's heavy-handed response to protesters have stoked a national debate over police aggression and brutality. Other police departments in the St. Louis area have adopted wearable cameras following Brown's killing, with advocates pushing for legislation that would make the devices mandatory. ""They are really enjoying them."" The cameras deployed at Saturday's protest lost battery power by the end of the day, but Jackson tells the Post-Dispatch that they would remain powered through a normal shift. According to the police chief, the cameras captured images and video of protesters taunting the police, adding that feedback within the department has so far been positive.

""Read our commands carefully before the raid."" A few lines later. ""Don't comment. Don't curse. Just report them."" It's military talk, but they're not soldiers. It's a Facebook raid, conducted on July 12th against an independent Vietnamese news site called the Khmer Krom News. Below the post, dozens of comments weigh in with support: ""Damn them, let’s finish them off,"" and ""I set up dozens of accounts for this =))"" ""Don't comment. Don't curse. Just report them."" The publication had been too critical of the government, it turns out, and even though most of the commenters are civilians, they’re ready to suit up to make sure the paper can’t keep publishing its critical views. The strategy is simple — rack up enough abuse reports to knock the site off Facebook, effectively cutting it off from its audience. It's a surprising tactic, but it works. Vietnamese groups have counted 44 different journalists and activists who have had their accounts taken down in recent months, including countless more publications. For many, like the journalist Liberty Melinh, the shutdown turns into a permanent hiatus. This isn't the first time activists have run into trouble on Facebook. Despite the service's much-feted role in the Arab Spring, it's also been a place where hostile regimes and their supporters can chase down opposition figures, whether it's Assad-friendly hackers in Syria or Putin-friendly trolls in Russia. But Vietnam is the first place where Facebook’s own policies have been singled out for enabling attacks — in particular, the service's ""Report Abuse"" button, which is used to flag content that's hostile or inappropriate. The button is designed to protect Facebook users from the same threats and abuse that often run rampant on Twitter and Tumblr, but as the raid shows, that protection can also be used as a tool for stifling dissent. Facebook says the ""report abuse"" button is just one of many tools the company looks at when removing content. ""Convincing lots of people to report something won’t cause the information to be taken down or hidden unless there’s something else about it that violates our policies,"" the rep told us. But it's unclear which policy Trang and the other journalists might have violated, particularly since most of the sites were later reinstated. Facebook declined to comment on particular cases in Vietnam. But after dozens of cases, the pattern is clear enough. If you swarm a page or a person with enough abuse reports, you can kick them off Facebook. Pro-government forces in Vietnam have learned how to do it, and they’re using it to devastating effect. ""By now, it's hundreds of pages that have been knocked down."" For journalist Pham Doan Trang, it's meant that the free space of Facebook has become effectively controlled by her political opponents. ""They have been escalating since mid-June,"" Trang says, ""by now, it’s hundreds of pages that have been knocked down,"" both from individuals and larger publications. Generally, the pages were taken offline through Facebook raids like the one that targeted Trang — a large group of people all pressing the Report Abuse button at once. Anything they were trying to say is effectively silenced, whether it’s breaking news or reports from a protest. Because of Facebook’s semi-anonymous nature, it’s also difficult to say exactly who is running the accounts that organize the raids. Vietnam's propaganda office employs almost 1,000 ""opinion shapers,"" tasked with influencing online opinion in the government’s favor, but many of the people involved in the attack say they are simply supporters of the government. Reached by The Verge, one said he didn’t work for the government, but that ""I protect them without receiving any benefit or money."" As a result, it's hard to prove to Facebook that the raid was a government-sponsored attack rather than a garden-variety flame war. ""This is a fight for democracy in Vietnam."" The problems have led many to question Facebook's approach, particularly among web activists. ""I would prefer that companies not regulate content,"" says Jillian C. York, a director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""But if they have to, they need to be clear about their rules, and I don't think there's ever a reason they should report political opposition parties."" At the same time, Facebook's global status means it has to find a single set of rules for its operations all across the world. In other countries, the rules come under fire for not restricting enough content, as when groups like ISIS try to use Facebook as a platform to spread their message. In countries like Vietnam, there's also the real risk that ending up on the wrong side of the government will endanger Facebook's ability to operate in the country at all. More than two-thirds of the country use the service — a full 25 million in all — but until 2011, Facebook faced a countrywide block in Vietnam over concerns of spreading discontent, and it's easy to imagine the block returning if the regime has a change of heart. Already, activists have been prosecuted for ""abusing democratic freedoms"" based on status updates, and there's a sense that anything posted on the site could quickly turn into evidence. ""In Vietnam, there's a saying,"" Trang says, ""we have freedom of expression but we don't have freedom after expression."" Trang still isn't angry at Facebook for the troubles. She says that ""without Facebook there would be almost no dissident groups in Vietnam."" But she also has a few specific changes in mind: add more review to the Report Abuse process, require more background on users who report, and institute penalties for anyone making a report that's found to be phony. They're simple changes, but spread across a billion users, they could have a huge effect. It would be a messier Facebook, with more freedom for activists and more freedom for hostile groups too. The bigger question is whether, three years after the Arab Spring, Facebook is willing to loosen its restrictions, and whether vulnerable bloggers can survive if it doesn’t. ""I just want Facebook to help these people,"" Trang says. ""This is a fight for democracy in Vietnam.""",0.6174228049413362,0.38257719505866383,0.8272283439096818,1043,5.0949185043144771,549,6.1766848816029141,0,0,"US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Welles' final film, The Other Side of the Wind, may be finished this year thanks to a crowdfunding campaign that launches today on Indiegogo.  Welles was able to cut only 40 minutes of the film This is the latest — and what may well be the last — step in the very long history of The Other Side of the Wind. Welles began filming it in 1970 and continued to shoot for six years amid cast turnover, constant script changes, and funding issues. After filming wrapped, the negatives were locked away and legal battles over who actually owned the footage prevented him from working on it. Perpetual funding issues didn't help either. Now decades later, a production company has gotten all the rights holders to come together. Collectively, they hope to raise $2 million on Indiegogo to finish the film. That money will go toward actually taking hold of the original negatives, having them scanned in 4K, and then move on to editing, coloring, restoring, and scoring the footage. Welles cut around 40 minutes of the film by the time of his death, in 1985, and supposedly left extensive notes on what the film is supposed to look like. It'll be impossible to replicate precisely what Welles would have done with the film had he been given the chance. But the production company behind this effort makes it sound as though those involved are trying to stay as true to Welles' vision as possible. According to The Hollywood Reporter, they've brought on Affonso Gonçalves, editor of Winter's Bone and Beasts of the Southern Wild, to put it all together. He'll also be working with Peter Bogdanovich, a star of the film.  The Other Side of the Wind was supposed to be a Hollywood comeback for Welles. Appropriately, the film was about a great director, apparently modeled after Hemingway, who is trying to make a comeback with a new movie. Welles' film is also supposed to feature pieces of the fictional film that's being made within its story. Modern filmmakers have easily surpassed $2 million in crowdfunding But $2 million is by no means an unreasonable sum to look for through crowdfunding. Zach Braff raised over $3 million to make a film, a Super Troopers sequel raised over $4.4 million, and the Veronica Mars movie hit $5.7 million. Of course, those names all have a huge base of fans around today — Welles is an enormous name in filmmaking, but his name likely doesn't generate the type of wide excitement that a Super Troopers sequel does, however unfair that may seem to cinephiles. Still, it's easy to imagine that crowdfunding is a medium Welles would have approved of. He frequently ran into funding issues and troubles with Hollywood, leading him to take on acting roles to support his movies. It's taken a long, long time, but it seems like Welles' fans will finally be able to get The Other Side of the Wind the funding it needs to be finished.",0.5207281805071085,0.47927181949289155,0.15678805767525242,542,4.7269372693726934,297,5.6868686868686869,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Film",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

All I knew was that it was directed by Richard Linklater and that it starred Jack Black — in my mind, a pretty good combination. The film was Bernie, and it turned out to be one of the smartest and funniest films of 2012. It was also a long overdue reminder of how incredible Jack Black can be when given the right role.  Black hasn't been around much these past several years Since then, Black’s appearances have been scant. His last major live-action films came a couple of years prior, with the critically panned Year One (2009) and Gulliver's Travels (2010). In the time since, Black has popped up here and there — voice work, web series, movie cameos — but for the most part, he's been off the radar. It’s a pretty dramatic change compared to the decade after he broke out in High Fidelity. During the 2000s, Black was always around somewhere, making cameos in big comedies like Anchorman and Walk Hard, landing a starring role in King Kong, and just generally doing his thing, even when that meant making a Tenacious D movie. Black’s been away from the mainstream for a good four years, but he's about to come back in a big way. In October, he'll be playing R.L. Stine in the nostalgia-baiting Goosebumps film. Next month, he'll begin starring in the new HBO comedy series The Brink. But his return begins with something a bit smaller: today’s release of the indie comedy The D Train. The D Train has Black playing a family man who risks his job and marriage in order to impress an actor who he went to high school with two decades earlier. Inevitably, he’s driven toward rock bottom as he becomes more and more desperate for people to think he's cool.  The D Train places Black in the type of role that he excels in. It's so easy to remember Black for his over-the-top performances — and he often does those well — but he's at his best as the dopey everyman, someone you're kind of rooting for even as he makes bad decisions. There's a moment seconds into The D Train that's sort of the perfect example of how Black handles these roles. It's a subtle little bit of physicality — Black wagging his tongue to delicately lick the back of a suction cup. Most viewers will probably forget about it in an instant, but it's the exact entrance needed to convey how sadly dedicated this character is to the meaningless endeavors in his life — namely, getting a suction cup to stick to a pane of glass. At the same time, it demonstrates exactly what Black does so well: finding those ridiculous comedic notes in everyday actions. His characters are real (and really uncool), yet they're unintentionally funny in everything they do. Black's characters are best when they aren't patently ridiculous This formula should feel familiar to any fan of Black: School of Rock has him playing a substitute teacher who's desperate to be a rock star; Bernie has him playing a funeral home director who’s pushed to his breaking point by a mean widow. The humor falls back on him, and the same is basically true for The D Train. ""Usually I play the lovable loser,"" Black said on Late Night with Seth Meyers earlier this week. ""This time, a twist: hateable loser."" The film really works off of Black's performance as a loser, and I can imagine that it will play really well for a certain kind of masochistic audience, as they cringe at the misfortune his character brings upon himself. For me, it was a little too much like the social equivalent of a horror film — most of the time, I was just too uncomfortable to laugh. But just the fact that it was that viscerally effective says so much about what Black is able to bring to the role. Some events and interactions in this movie border on absurd, but they don't get there because Black's character never becomes a caricature — he's able to facilitate these wild interactions while still being the affable, hapless everyman. His natural strength in these roles makes it all the more surprising that Black seems to be trying something different for his next act: HBO’s The Brink. The series is about three men in the middle of a political crisis, and it places Black in what — at first glance — appears to be far from his typical loser.  In just the first 15 seconds of The Brink’s debut teaser, Black's character spends most of his time punching down, making fun of outsiders, and generally acting surly and smug. Let’s be clear: I'm reading into the mere seconds of footage that we've seen from this show so far, but the humor doesn’t seem to land. Maybe that's because of the tired jokes (at the end of the teaser, one character essentially acknowledges this!), but it's also an odd position for Black. Sure, Black can be obnoxious, but he isn’t cool. He isn’t a winner. The Brink gives him the kind of jokes that you can imagine landing perfectly if they came out of Jack Donaghy's mouth in 30 Rock, but it all feels a little off coming from a guy who you kind of want to be pals with. Mining the loser isn't such a bad idea Putting Black in that position means missing out on what we enjoy most about his comedy. It’s easy to think now that we were crazy to fall for Black in the first place, especially when you look back over his films. How many great comedies did he actually star in? Surprisingly few. But I think the reason we’re still excited by Black is because, even in his worst roles, he brings along a sense of humanity. Maybe it’s good for Black to see where else his wild kicks and shrieks can succeed, but the ""lovable loser"" isn’t such a bad formula to keep turning back to. There are a whole lot of interesting losers out there. It's not hard to see 2015 as a year of revival for Black. Five years ago, he flopped out of the box office pretty hard. The D Train likely isn't bound to bring Black a ton of fanfare, but it puts him on the right track. It turns out, it's pretty reasonable to have missed what Black can do at his best, when his wild comedy slips out through his most realistic performances. Here's hoping his next two projects let him do just that.",0.5523634030352735,0.44763659696472646,0.1643626114410998,1134,4.4920634920634921,566,5.6466431095406362,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Film, Movie Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The studio announced today that principal photography has begun on Captain America: Civil War while detailing the main cast for the movie, and I'm just going to say it: things are starting to feel a little unwieldy. Obviously, Chris Evans' Captain America is starring in the film, but according to Marvel's announcement no less than seven other existing Avengers will also be showing up:  On top of that, the movie is also going to feature Paul Rudd's Ant-Man, a character that audiences won't even formally meet until this July. But while that may seem like a lot, I can hear what you're saying right now. ""Hey Bryan, it's not any worse than Age of Ultron. They don't even have Bruce Banner or Thor listed!"" But wait, there's more. The movie is also going to feature Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Agent 13 (Emily VanCamp), Crossbones (Frank Grillo), the return of William Hurt as General Thunderbolt Ross, and both Daniel Brühl (The Fifth Estate) and Martin Freeman (Sherlock and far too many other wonderful things to count) in unnamed roles. The most jam-packed movie in Marvel's history All of which is to say that Captain America: Civil War is starting to look like the most jam-packed movie in Marvel's history — and that's not necessarily a good thing. Managing an expanded universe like this is difficult because there are so many characters to keep straight. When you take your time and do so deliberately, you get the first Avengers: a wonderful pay-off filled with delightful character moments and action that becomes a global phenomenon. When things get rushed — or too much setup gets jammed in at the expense of the movie at hand — you get something a lot closer to Age of Ultron. It's also worth noting that while the original Avengers served as a capper to the first phase of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, setting up Iron Man 3 and every film that followed, Age of Ultron was a stand-alone movie of the week in comparison, leaving Tony Stark's angst and Captain America's disillusionment behind without barely a mention. If anything, it appears that Civil War has been designed to be the inflection point from which all future Marvel movies extend. As Yahoo's Jordan Zakarin put it, this is more Avengers 2.5 than Captain America 3. Damn, the ‘Captain America: Civil War’ cast is so big, it’s basically ‘Avengers 2.5’ pic.twitter.com/mW1gMKpPun  Audience fatigue may be starting to set in That's not to say it can't be pulled off. Civil War writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely proved that the Marvel universe could be something much richer with Captain America: Winter Soldier, and with the Russo brothers behind the camera there's every indication a film about internal strife amongst The Avengers is in the perfect hands. But we're also at a moment where the signs of superhero fatigue may be starting to appear. Age of Ultron is doing extraordinarily well, but nobody's saying it was better than the first. Ant-Man is just around the corner, but it hasn't picked up Guardians of the Galaxy levels of anticipation just yet. And every single day audiences are bombarded by more pictures of Deadpool, or the Joker, or Harley Quinn, or some other comic book hero being brought to the big or small screen. And that's not to mention the two Avengers: Infinity War films, which ostensibly will be even bigger than Civil War. The benefit of an expanded universe is the opportunity to tell rich stories with a broad palette of characters over the course of years, not hours. The danger is audience burnout.",0.552937694935582,0.447062305064418,0.1949305555561063,631,4.8700475435816166,358,5.7988826815642458,1,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Essay, Film",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The reality right now is that Apple Music and Google Play Music, Spotify and Rdio, and any other pair of other music streaming services sound pretty similar on the surface. They offer about 30 million songs for about $10 a month. They let you play music offline and offer radio services and playlists if you don't feel like picking something yourself. They stream in relatively high-quality audio, and they probably have some videos for you to watch. But there are some key differences between them, and they could just change whether you'd like to choose one over the other. The biggest differentiator remains Spotify's free, ad-supported tier on desktop and mobile. It's something that no one else can match, and it makes Spotify the obvious starting place to go if you're thinking about trying out streaming music for the first time. Of course, Apple is hoping that its three month free trial can change that, especially since its service is built right into every new iPhone. Apple has some other highlights that it's hoping will get listeners on board. Siri control could make the service more accessible, and its $14.99 per month family plan is a relative bargain. Apple Music may also turn out to have some exclusives from artists in its social Connect section, though there are legitimate reasons to question how well that'll play out. And then there's Taylor Swift. Maybe her fans all own the album by now, but being the only service streaming 1989 can only help.

The impact was entirely planned by NASA engineers in order to conclude the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) program, which launched late last year. After studying the composition of the lunar atmosphere for months, the spacecraft didn't have the fuel to continue flight and engineers decided it was best to place it down on the far side of the moon, out of sight and far from previous historic landing sites. During six months of research, the spacecraft performed careful analysis of the lunar atmosphere. One of its discoveries was finding trace amounts of water in the atmosphere. However, NASA wasn't able to answer a decades-long question that it hoped to solve over the course of the mission. NASA was looking to explain reports from Apollo astronauts of an aurora borealis-like glow on the horizon just before sunrise. Scientists hypothesized that dust particles in the thin lunar atmosphere accounted for the reports, but the spacecraft was unable to confirm that was the case. Nevertheless, NASA was able to complete its analysis of the atmosphere and therefore the (relatively inexpensive) $280 million mission was a success. Correction: One of NASA's primary goals for the LADEE mission was to investigate reports of a glow on the horizon, and while mission engineers weren't able to definitively explain the phenomenon, the spacecraft was successfully able to study the atmosphere.

After weeks of delays, SpaceX is preparing to launch its third supply mission to the International Space Station. The Falcon 9 rocket and accompanying Dragon capsule are expected to blast off from Cape Canaveral at 3:25 EDT, and the craft is set to rendezvous with the space station on the morning of Sunday, April 20th. A video feed of the takeoff will go live around 2:45PM. The CRS-3 mission, carried out through a partnership with NASA, comes almost two years after the Dragon capsule became the first commercial craft to ever dock with the ISS. This time, SpaceX is using the flight to test the next steps in its plan for a reusable rocket. The first stage of the Falcon rocket has been equipped with four landing legs. After launch, it will separate as normal, then attempt to slow itself and make a controlled return to Earth, which would allow it to be used again after being fished out of the ocean.   The odds of this happening successfully aren't great — SpaceX VP Hans Koenigsmann put them at between 30 and 40 percent earlier this month. SpaceX has previously managed to restart the first stage's engine after it separated, but it hasn't yet pulled off a landing. A reusable rocket would allow SpaceX to save millions, especially if it can eventually pull off the more difficult trick of recovering the second stage, which drops off at a higher altitude. But even if it fails, the central supply mission won't be compromised. As long as nothing else goes wrong, in fact, SpaceX and NASA will be breaking new ground on the ISS. The capsule is carrying red romaine lettuce and radishes in an experimental plant growth chamber, part of a test project meant to give astronauts a source of fresh food. Since its original launch date on March 16th, though, the third supply mission has been delayed by technical snags. The first takeoff was aborted so SpaceX could resolve ""remaining open items,"" and a second planned launch on March 30th was called off because an Air Force tracking radar system at Cape Canaveral shorted out. On the latest date, April 14th, the Falcon rocket's first stage sprung a helium leak. SpaceX maintained that its backup systems would have still made a launch successful, but it pushed the launch back to today despite weather concerns. This morning, NASA reported a 40 percent chance that weather would be amenable, so we'll be watching for confirmation that the launch is taking place. Update April 22nd, 3:45PM ET: in a press conference following the launch, Musk said that SpaceX had been unable to recover the reusable rocket due to rough seas, according to Mother Nature Network. ""I heard reports of 13- to 20-foot wave heights. It's really pretty crazy out there,"" Musk reportedly said. ""In fact, the [retrieval] boats weren't able to get close because of the heavy seas.

One batch of pills was laced with an antibiotic instead In the study, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology tested 25 batches of emergency contraceptives purchased from 15 pharmacies and distributors in Lima, Peru. Of those 25 batches, seven didn't dissolve quickly enough. Yet that performance was still slightly better than that of a batch that didn't contain contraceptive ingredients at all.

These condoms, officials said, had been manufactured in unsanitary conditions and were ""low-quality."" The US has also had its share of scares. As recently as 2011, the FDA issued a warning against using a morning-after pill labeled ""Evital"" because the pill was counterfeit — and entirely ineffective. The study published today was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has donated money to groups working on contraceptives before. One of its most recent projects is aimed at building a ""next-generation condom"" that will enhance sensation and reliability, and therefore encourage its use. But while the world waits for a better condom, the researchers in this study are focusing their attention on improving contraceptive drug testing techniques. They plan to make portable tools that will help inspectors analyze the contents of these drugs in the field. This, they hope, will halt the distribution of fake emergency contraceptives before they can make their way into the hands of already anxious consumers.",0.40599204743354833,0.5940079525664517,0.8196716085759705,404,5.3564356435643568,245,6.073469387755102,0,0,"Science, US & World",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's part of the company's long-standing policy of ""surge pricing"": using an algorithm that raises prices to adjust for demand. Uber says the higher prices motivate more drivers to hit the road, ensuring that there are always enough cars available for customers, at least those who can afford much steeper fares. The adjusted prices, which got as high as $35 a mile, were roughly eight times the regular fare. The minimum of $175 a ride took many customers by surprise and they reacted with anger. Surge pricing happens regularly in Uber’s busiest markets, and has drawn customer outrage and media scrutiny before, including in New York during the snowstorm on New Year's Eve, 2011, and during Hurricane Sandy. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has always staunchly defended the practice. ""Surge pricing only kicks in in order to maximize the number of trips that happen and therefore reduce the number of people that are stranded,"" he told Wired in a recent interview. If Uber couldn't meet demand, says Kalanick, customers would come to think of the service as unreliable, and choose to avoid it in the future. ""I call it dark energy. If you are unreliable, customers just disappear."" ""Surge pricing only kicks in in order to ... reduce the number of people that are stranded."" A large group of professional economists polled on this issue agree with Kalanick. When supply is tight, the thinking goes, raising prices will encourage more players to get creative about finding ways to fill that demand. The vast majority of consumers, however, do not. A study by Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel Kahneman, Fairness as a Constraint on Profit Seeking, found that 80 percent of Americans polled thought surge pricing was unfair and unjust. This kind of popular sentiment explains why, as of 2008, no less than 34 states had passed laws against price gouging, which Uber calls surge pricing. Many of these laws are aimed at preventing a sharp jump in the prices of essential goods and services during an emergency like a natural disaster. These laws don’t make sense in a free market, many economists argue — higher prices, and profits, would encourage people to fill the demand for the scarce resource — but they appeal to our moral nature, and make good political talking points.     What Uber was doing may be illegal It's here that Uber’s snowstorm surge may be on thin ice. When Hurricane Sandy took out mass transit, demand for rides jumped and Uber's pricing algorithm raised fares accordingly. Customers responded with outrage on social media. The company initially defended the price hike, saying it would incentivize more drivers to hit the roads. Eventually it backed down and reverted fares to normal. Kalanick wrote, ""There are huge losses for the business in doing this initiative, but will do it as long as we can today while we figure out more sustainable ways to keep supply up while the city is in need."" But according to New York state law, what Uber was doing may actually be illegal. A statement released by the Attorney General's office specifically called out the taxi industry, noting:   This recent snowstorm was hardly a weather emergency. And Uber would likely argue that its prices are being set by the market, and aren't therefore ""unconscionably excessive."" But during the surge this weekend Uber riders not only had to pay a sevenfold increase in the rates per mile, but also abide by a $175 minimum. That means customers could be charged $175 for a ride that lasted a mile or two. Price-gouging penalties have been applied to gas station and supermarkets for far smaller markups. ""It puts those without high disposable income at incredible risk."" ""During the past week, we’ve seen yet another example of Uber’s price gouging during an emergency situation. Uber has openly stated its intention to destroy taxi operations in cities across the country. Imagine, for a moment, that Uber is successful. Each time there’s an emergency, a snowstorm, or just heavy traffic, passengers would be forced to pay outrageous fares or be shut out of getting a ride,"" said Robert Werth, president of the Taxicab, Limousine & Paratransit Association, an opponent of Uber that has fought against its entry into the New York market. ""It puts those without high disposable income at incredible risk, and destroys the quality of life and transportation assurances that taxicabs provide. Uber doesn’t want to serve the full community. It wants to line its pockets with profiteering."" Legal questions aside, Uber might have sound economic reasons for reconsidering its policies. Fairness isn't typically something economists and entrepreneurs who believe in the free market concern themselves with, but in this case Uber would be well served to heed Kahneman's research. That's because the customers from his study who said this kind of surge pricing was unfair also said they would avoid merchants who used it by shopping elsewhere once the supply and demand evened out. As Harvard philsophy profressor Michael Sandel wrote in his 2009 book on our perceptions of justice, ""Public support for price-gouging laws comes from something more visceral than welfare or freedom. People are outraged at ‘vultures’ who prey on the desperation of others, and want them punished.""",0.46038080798236175,0.5396191920176383,0.7782359941136253,914,5.0317286652078774,508,6.1850393700787398,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne tells both the Financial Times and The Los Angeles Times that the company plans to accept Bitcoin in the second half of next year — and possibly within the next four months. The retailer does over $1 billion of revenue primarily reselling closeout merchandise it acquires from other stores, and it would be the largest retailer to accept the virtual currency. Others like Reddit, OkCupid, Ouya, Virgin Galactic, and the University of Nicosia in Cyprus recently opened up to Bitcoin payments. Byrne explained the decision to The Los Angeles Times, saying ""I think we'll pick up ... the market share of people who'd prefer to pay in Bitcoin, with an honest currency."" However, he added that the decision is ""also philosophical, part and parcel with my belief in a limited government — that if you want limited government you can't give it power to expand the monetary base."" Byrne is a self-identified libertarian, and he believes in the benefits of a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, which isn't attached to any government and has a limited supply. But Bitcoin has some major obstacles to pass before becoming a suitable replacement for currencies like the US Dollar. Its infamous volatility (BTC prices zigzagged between roughly $500 and $1200 this month alone) means those who hold it are afraid to spend it, and companies are rightly reluctant to give up merchandise for a currency that could lose half its value in a day. In this sense, Overstock.com isn't fully embracing Bitcoin. Byrne says the company would convert Bitcoin payments to USD daily. Nevertheless, more avenues that allow Bitcoin to be used for exchange rather than speculation could help stabilize the virtual currency.",0.846852213471734,0.153147786528266,0.8914897938043381,304,5.0690789473684212,194,5.8505154639175254,0,0,Business,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
