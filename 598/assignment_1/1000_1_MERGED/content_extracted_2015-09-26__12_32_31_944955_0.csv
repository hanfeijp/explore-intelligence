This morning he appeared on stage at the International Space Station R&D conference in Boston, saying ""the accident was a huge blow to SpaceX."" Musk was speaking to the bigger picture, but his comment echoes the company's immediate future. Right now, the next Falcon 9 launch (and likely the subsequent launches) is postponed until SpaceX can resolve the issue that caused last week's failure. He didn't go into any more detail about the accident, though. ""I know there’s media in the audience,"" he laughed. ""I don’t want to say something that subsequently turns out to be a misunderstanding of the situation."" The SpaceX CEO seemed confounded by the Falcon 9 mishap, and he readily admitted how it's stumped him and his team. ""The data does seem to be quite difficult to interpret,"" Musk said. ""Whatever happened was not straightforward."" ""Whatever happened was not straightforward"" The failed launch was not only supposed to resupply the space station, but was also supposed to serve as the third major test of the potentially reusable Falcon 9 rocket's ability to land. ""The last launch we had the best chance of landing the vehicle on the drone ship in the Atlantic,"" Musk said. As for when the next test might be, Musk wouldn't say much more than it will happen ""later this year."" Since the accident, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden has publicly reaffirmed his support of SpaceX in both its cargo and human spaceflight efforts. According to Bolden, NASA believes the recent failure won't affect SpaceX's ability to bring NASA astronauts to space in 2017 as part of the commercial crew program. Musk echoed this sentiment on stage, and spoke a little about where SpaceX stands. ""Things seem to be going fairly well in the commercial crew front,"" Musk said. ""Overall, there are small disagreements here and there, but overall we very much agree with the way it’s being done. It’s pretty good.""   While Musk did tweet shortly after the launch that it seems the rocket disintegrated because of an explosion in the upper stage's oxygen tanks, he said there's still ""no clear theory that matches all the data"" for why the Falcon failed. Musk typically takes to Twitter to offer information and insight following launches, something interviewer and ISS manager Michael Suffredini praised him for. But in the wake of the Falcon 9 explosion he has remained rather tight-lipped on the social media service. One thing he has mentioned is that SpaceX would release more information later this week about the explosion, which he reiterated on stage at the conference today.

Located in picturesque Joshua Tree — right in Southern California's High Desert — the home is at a comfortable equilibrium with its barren desert environment. The structure is dominated by soaring concrete ribs, but the overall effect is similar to the Native American adobe pueblos that were once scattered across the American southwest. The concrete is understated, despite its impressive form, making it a perfect match for the muted palette of the desert landscape. But it's the location that makes this a spectacular structure. Owners Bev and Jay Doolittle wooed organic architect Ken Kellogg to the project simply by showing him their striking 10-acre plot of land in Joshua Tree. In the late ’80s, when the couple began the project, they sent Kellogg a letter asking him to visit the site. They also sent some photos of the land. ""Boy that was a good hook, that got him out here,"" Bev Doolittle tells The Desert Sun (via Curbed LA). ""He was jumping all over the rocks like a mountain goat. He had been looking for rocks to build on.""        The main structure was completed in 1993, but interior design work by John Vugrin continued for a number of years afterwards. Vugrin did his best to design an interior to match the building. Tables and shelves sweep across rooms, from the ceiling to the floor and back again. Custom-designed light fixtures incorporate some of the ribbing prevalent in the house's exterior. When it was all said and done, the Doolittles, who are now 66 and 71 years old, didn't move into the home until the 2000s. After 10 years, the couple decided downsize, and they put the property up for sale earlier this year at a price of $3 million. While the Doolittles have moved on, the sale has produced some spectacular photos of the property for us to gawk at — be sure to take a look below.

This is achievable thanks to two-way mirrors and facade projectors that transform the mirrors into a screen at nighttime. Now that they've won, the winners — two Romanian architects named Alexandru Oprita and Laurentiu Constantin — will receive $1220, and a 10-week internship at Snohetta, an international architecture office in Norway.     Alexandru Oprita & Laurentiu Constantin The runners-up were just as imaginative. Two Polish architects, for example, designed Santa's workshop as a giant, public climbing wall that sort of looks like an icy hockey puck. The building is powered by a slew of solar panels that they placed on the roof.  ""Finland is mostly flat country,"" the architects write in their proposal. But Finns love winter sports. So, ""the building will give them opportunity, not only to climb in the summer, but also to iceclimb in winter.""

Unsurprisingly, Ospital's style and technique harken back to that time, with a distinctly late-1980s, early-1990s look. The colors are bright, the characters long and exaggerated. Ospital's world is full of adventure and life, and while much of his work is done for clients, he also takes on plenty of personal projects that give him the freedom to create exactly what he wants.

It seemed like a quirky touch not out of character at an airport with an abundance of art and whose drinking fountains play amplified gargling sounds. Then I noticed them in Durham. Then in San Diego.  If I had to pick places I’d expect to see rocking chairs, front porches, living rooms, and pretty much anywhere else would rank far above cavernous and stark airport terminals, yet that’s probably where I’m most likely to see them. And while I could imagine an aggressively whimsical designer somewhere throwing a bunch of rocking chairs in a terminal, I had a hard time seeing how they’d sprung up in so many airports across the country. Why rocking chairs? Where did they come from?  It turns out they come from a guy named Champ Land and his wife, Jean, who co-own Troutman Chairs in North Carolina, where the trend began. ""We’ve got rockers in about 40 airports around the country,"" Land says, perplexed by my call at first but clearly proud of his dominance in the airport rocking chair industry. ""Philly has rockers, Burlington has rockers — right many of the North and South Carolina airports have rockers."" The chairs are called Kennedy Rockers, named after the type that John F. Kennedy used to alleviate his back pain. Kennedy had dozens of the chairs and placed them everywhere  — in the Oval Office, at Camp David, and aboard Air Force One. Kennedy’s chairs were made by P&P, another North Carolina company, which the Lands bought in 2009. The chairs are tall and straight, with flat wooden slats running up the back and a curved seat. In airports, they’re usually painted white or stained and left unpainted. The trend started by accident in 1997 at Charlotte Douglas International Airport. The airport had a temporary photography exhibit called Porch Sitting, says Haley Gentry, who manages amenities at Charlotte Douglas. There were large photos of front porches, with rocking chairs, and in front of the photos, as props, actual rocking chairs. When the exhibit’s time was up they took the chairs away, and people got upset. ""We didn’t realize how popular they were 'til we went to remove the exhibit,"" Gentry says. ""We went to remove the rocking chairs and we got such a public outcry that we said, ‘Wow, we need to keep these here,’ and we expanded them."" From there, the rockers spread from airport to airport. The people I spoke to at Sea-Tac and Miami were a little hazy on exactly where the idea for the chairs came from — someone who worked for the airport saw them at another airport, thought they were nice, and contacted Land, who became the de facto supplier of airport rocking chairs. The chairs caught on for the same reason they seem so out of place: airports are not, typically, pleasant and relaxing places. Security is an ordeal. The threat of missed flights or delays gives everything an undercurrent of anxiety. And through it all, you’re lugging unwieldy baggage. Rocking chairs signal the opposite of hurry. They’re also an easy addition to terminals, which are ordinarily difficult to renovate. Airports are always in use; they can’t be simply shut down and redesigned, so any improvements have to be made piecemeal. Rocking chairs are basically modular seating that can be installed overnight and rearranged as needed. A bonus, Gentry points out, is that they can be moved near power outlets, often in short supply at older terminals. ""Airports tend to be such a fast-paced environment,"" Gentry says. ""It can be overwhelming for people who aren’t seasoned travelers. The rocker is a yin to that yang. It’s more of a slow pace. You’re controlling the rocker, where a lot of the time in an airport you’re not controlling your environment. It’s a nice pause button in a hectic environment.""

Announced at a KDDI press event in Tokyo today, the Fx0 is a striking 4.7-inch smartphone with a transparent shell and a home button decorated with the golden Firefox logo embracing the Earth. It runs the latest version of Mozilla's web-centric mobile OS and was designed by noted Japanese designer Tokujin Yoshioka, whose previous collaboration with KDDI produced a phone worthy of making it into the Museum of Modern Art's collection. With the Fx0, Yoshioka has worked around the familiar outlines of LG's G3 design (LG is the silent partner producing the device) and adapted them to a smaller size while producing a delightful aesthetic in the process. Like a watch with a window showing its internal mechanism, this phone's exposed electronics are a subtle reminder of its technical sophistication — plus, that Firefox home button is just plain cool. The Fx0 marks a break from Mozilla's established strategy of making the cheapest possible phones and dares to stray into the middle of the smartphone price and spec range. At a cost of 50,000 yen (roughly $420), this smartphone is significantly more expensive than the average Firefox OS handset, but it seeks to justify that price rise with its good looks and greater capabilities. NFC, LTE, and other widely adopted features are making their Firefox OS debut on the Fx0, making it a much more competitive and compelling proposition for buyers that are less constrained by their budget. Still, Firefox OS shouldn't be confused as any sort of competitor to the smartphone high end, and the base specs of the Fx0 are relatively underwhelming: a 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 processor, 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, and a 2,370mAh battery. The device is built by LG, and it embodies the next big step for Firefox OS, but KDDI is the company in charge of its fate. Together with Mozilla, the Japanese carrier hopes to promote the concept of ""a new worldwide WoT (Web of Things) experience, which connects various objects using Web technology regardless of PC or smartphone."" KDDI has created a dedicated Fx sub-site and is encouraging developers to get involved and build out the Firefox OS software ecosystem, marking a significant investment into helping the platform prosper and grow. The Fx0 goes on limited sale this Thursday, December 25th, and will be available across Japan from January 6th. It's unlikely that the custom KDDI design will ever go global, but it certainly sets a beautiful tone for future devices in the Firefox OS family.",0.869520488974143,0.13047951102585698,0.2980878975672335,444,4.9684684684684681,269,6.0817843866171,0,28,"Design, Mobile, Tech, Photo Essay"

He pointed out that in Sweden, Spotify already charges roughly $20 a month for a family of five. The Verge has reached out to other services for comment as well. This leaves a big question: did Apple negotiate an incredible deal with the music labels? Or did it decide to spend some of the $150 billion in cash it has in the bank to subsidize a very generous package? If the industry reacts by matching Apple's prices, does that mean the labels are simply willing to offer consumers a better deal, or is Apple forcing its competitors to further trim their already very thin margins? It's worth noting the deal is very similar to one previously offered by Beats Music in partnership with AT&T.

Today it's rolling out new desktop apps for Mac and PC, and announcing an integration with Ticketmaster that will let users access exclusive concerts. Can access to live performances make a difference? The desktop app has a familiar layout, identical to the web player it already released. The main difference from Spotify is that the featured selection includes a handful of videos and tracks with big ""exclusive"" banners, including a new cut from Lil Wayne, who just signed with Tidal today. Tidal lets you poke around here even if you haven't paid, but you can't play anything without subscribing.

Along with Autodesk, Disney, and NASA was a small New York startup called Sketchfab, a platform for publishing, discovering, and sharing three-dimensional renderings of objects, like the one of yours truly below. ""People were surprised to see us in this group of big, well-established brands,"" says Alban Denoyel, Sketchfab’s co-founder and CEO. The young company is hoping to ride the wave of interest in virtual and augmented reality to become a household name. Microsoft isn’t the only company using Sketchfab’s technology to bring 3D to the masses. Facebook, which is laying the groundwork for its own virtual reality platform, integrated with Sketchfab two months ago, a partnership that until today had not been made public. It’s all part of a push toward augmented and virtual reality that Digi-Capital is forecasting to hit $150 billion by 2020.  Ben Popper from The Verge by 3D selfie on Sketchfab (admire that broken nose) ""When we started four year ago we couldn’t really see how the ecosystem would develop in terms of virtual reality and augmented reality. We were principally focused on 3D printing,"" says Denoyel. ""Over the past year, with Facebook buying Oculus, Google investing in Magic Leap, and then Microsoft’s HoloLens, we realized there was this huge opportunity for us."" Every big brand in tech has a horse in this race Last week Apple signaled it was joining the party with its acquisition of the augmented reality company, Metaio. ""Every big brand in tech is figuring out how to get into this area,"" says Denoyel. ""We are ideally positioned for this, because we have been working on optimizing 3D files so you can embed them anywhere."" The company’s big vision is to enable seamless sharing across VR, AR, and the web, a bridge between today's computing and the platforms of the future. Sketchfab has pivoted not just its focus, but its business model as well. ""We’ve pretty recently shifted to be a content platform, not a tool. Originally it was going to be a software as a service business where we charged users to upload files. But as we grew, it became clear there was more value in helping to distribute this content than charging people to host it."" The company removed the barriers to upload and no longer charges for storage, except on its pro version for private files. ""We have doctors using Sketchfab to share scans of teeth and stuff like that, they want to keep confidential, and we can monetize a little.""  Sketchfab's technology is perfectly suited to the HoloLens When you see HoloLens demoed, it’s clear how Sketchfab would fit in. Microsoft imagines people will sculpt and shape objects and then share them with fellow designers. This is a direct extension of the what Sketchfab did with 3D printing, making it simple to upload, publish, and share everything from architectural models to dental scans. As an example, Denoyel shows me a 3D-rendered model of a city in Nepal, shot by drones flying overhead. With a click, I can begin to navigate around the streets inside my web browser. What if I wanted to send it to a friend with a VR headset? ""This is ready for you to strap on an Oculus and walk through, without even needing to download anything. It renders right in that viewer."" Creating technology to share seamlessly across VR, AR, and the web In the last few months, big name brands like HTC and Activision Blizzard have begun using Sketchfab to share 3D models of their new phones and game characters on Facebook. In the future, AR is expected to be a hotbed for commerce, with people browsing through holographic items in their own living room instead of heading for the mall.  ""After AR hardware itself, aCommerce (an augmented cousin of eCommerce and mCommerce) and AR data could be the next largest revenue streams,"" says Digi-Capital Managing Director Tim Merel. ""3D-streamed content will be a major factor, so best-in-class solutions could thrive as the market grows."" This is also a sector where affiliate fees could add major revenue for companies that aren't themselves the merchant. Hardware makers will be hungry for content ""You want to own the workflow around these objects,"" said Alexander Taussig, an investor with Highland Capital Partners who has backed companies like Leap Motion and Jaunt. ""The big question for VR and AR is not the technology, it’s where will the content come from? Companies that can help to produce and distribute content for these new platforms will move the industry forward and potentially reap a major reward."" Along with helping to host and create content, the early days of these new industries will require cross-platform compatibility with older formats like web browsers. I might want to grab a 3D model of a phone from a link in my browser and send it to someone on an Oculus or HoloLens without missing a beat. The files could also flow in the other direction. ""The pipeline we have built over the last three years is taking all these 3D file formats and making them ready for the web,"" says Denoyel. ""But that also makes them ready for VR and AR."" What will user-generated VR content look like? Denoyel believes there will be a big market for simple, user-generated 3D content — objects and landscapes that aren’t interactive. ""There will be some studio quality stuff in the world of film and games. But the average person won’t be able to make that. They will be creating much simpler, more static stuff, at least at first."" The camera debuted by Google and GoPro last week is operating on that same thesis, that a world of amateur content, like YouTube, will help to fill in the gaps while professional media for this medium is still scarce. There will likely be one major competitor trying to leverage the user-generated approach: Google. At its recent I/O developer conference, the search giant showed off a camera that would allow anyone to shoot VR-ready content, and announced that YouTube will be a compatible player. Sketchfab has a big dream, this technology that can bridge the gap between the web we use today and the various realities that are in the near future. ""It’s not going to be as easy as they make it sound,"" says Taussig. ""But the long-term vision makes a lot of sense.""",0.5069929064319184,0.4930070935680816,0.2798450349613748,1098,4.8925318761384338,568,6.096830985915493,2,0,"Business, Tech, Report"

T-Mobile could act as a conduit for this from Dish's perspective, while the carrier would be able to increase its capacity and hopefully attract more customers. Looking forward, Dish would also get the benefit of a growing internet business in the face of declining TV subscriptions. In April, Legere signalled his willingness to partner with the media industry. ""I've always said it's not a matter of if; it's when and how. And now I'm going to add and who,"" he said.

On stage at Uber’s birthday party, looking out on an audience that included drivers, employees, the press, and his parents, Uber’s pugnacious CEO found himself overcome with emotion. ""I realize I can come across as a somewhat fierce advocate for Uber,"" Kalanick would go on to say, as the crowd chuckled appreciatively. ""I also realize some people have used a different ‘A’ word to describe me."" More laughter. ""I’ll be the first to admit I’m not perfect, and neither is this company. Like everyone else, we’ve made mistakes. But at Uber, we’re passionate about learning from them."" Five years into its run, Uber is a marvel. Available in 311 cities in 58 countries, it employs 3,000 people full time and has onboarded more than 1 million drivers. Uber has greatly expanded the market for taxi service, and has told investors its revenues will grow 400 percent this year, to $2 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. The company is currently said to be raising between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in new capital, valuing it at $50 billion. That would make it the most valuable venture-backed company ever. ""Some people have used a different 'A' word to describe me."" And yet Uber makes some people enormously uncomfortable, thanks to a series of missteps last year that vaulted it into the upper ranks of corporate supervillainy. Most famously, it casually threatened one journalist with a smear campaign and creepily tracked another using its all-seeing ""God View."" But it also regularly misled drivers about the amount of pay they could expect to take home; armed street teams with burner phones and credit cards to recruit competitors’ drivers; and coldly pledged to replace those drivers with autonomous vehicles as soon as it became feasible. Do enough things like that, and people start using a different ""A"" word to describe you. But hey — this is a party! There are balloons! There is … bottled water! And somehow … not any cake? Like, at all? Anyway, Kalanick has a vision he would like to share with you. It involves reducing traffic in your city, cutting down on pollution, and creating good jobs for your neighbors. And what he wants more than any of those things, as judged by the sheer vehemence with which he defends Uber on what is (after all) his baby’s fifth birthday party, is for you to feel good about taking Uber. ""It’s a future we will imagine together,"" Kalanick said, after describing a world in which we stop buying cars and take Uber everywhere. ""And I know that each and every one of us can’t wait to get back to work and start helping the cities around the world building a better tomorrow."" Improving stagecraft at the expense of authenticity The only rational response to #UberTurns5, as the event was hashtagged, is to review it as theater. The effect of hiring a former political operative to run your communications operation, as Uber did, is to improve your stagecraft at the expense of authenticity. #UberTurns5 was a roughly hour-long ensemble drama designed to make you feel good about ride-hailing — and to consider, with disgust, the trafficky, polluted, dependent-on-balky-public-transit world that would exist without it. The play unfolded in the cafeteria of Uber’s headquarters, which had been transformed into a clubby event space filled with low ultra-lounge couches and mood lighting. Flat-screen TVs stationed around the perimeter alternated between showing Uber milestones and testimonials from drivers. Twin bunches of turquoise balloons flanked the podium, which was bathed in neon-blue mood lighting.   Garrett Camp Garrett Camp, Kalanick’s rarely seen co-founder, took the stage first and offered us Uber’s meet-cute origin story. Would you believe it all started in Paris? It’s a story that has been revised more than once, but tonight the tale takes place at the Eiffel Tower, where Camp idly asks his friend, wouldn’t it be nice if you could tap a button and get a ride? Camp is followed on stage first by Austin Geidt, a plucky former intern-turned-leader of global expansion for the company, and then by Ryan Graves, Uber’s director of operations, who famously got a job at Uber by tweeting at the CEO. Their role is to marvel at how far Uber has come in such a short time, and to describe the space in which they worked when the company was very small. (The space was very small, too.) A meet cute in Paris Graves introduces Theresa Ferguson, who has driven for the company since earlier this year. Ferguson’s monologue is the highlight of the play: a working mother who used to manage a restaurant for 55 hours a week while her husband served in the Army. ""Back then I felt really, really guilty as a mom when I had to take time off work, or for doctor’s appointments,"" Ferguson said, crying a little as she talked about being away from her family so much. Uber lets her set her own schedule, she says, and this year she was able to volunteer at her son’s class for Valentine’s Day for the first time in five years. ""It really, really means a lot,"" she said. Thanks to Uber, she’s about to take her first two-week vacation with her family. It’s theater, sure. But I believed everything she said.   Theresa Ferguson For the finale, Kalanick takes the stage and outlines his vision. Political consultants have written a speech for him that makes him sound less like a CEO and more like he’s running for president. Like any good candidate, he repeats key words and phrases: There’s ""the transportation system is broken,"" meant to convey an air of inevitability. And there’s ""let us serve,"" Kalanick’s repeated plea to cities that haven’t yet legalized Uber, which gives him the air of a missionary. Eventually, Kalanick makes his goal plain: to make Uber so inexpensive that it’s cheaper not just than owning a car, but even taking public transportation. Uber will go where transit won’t, he says, and will deliver riders to their destinations more safely and efficiently. Already, almost half of Uber rides in San Francisco are Uber Pool rides, which match riders going in the same direction into a single car, and deliver them anywhere in the city for $7. ""This is our ultimate vision of the future,"" Kalanick says. ""Smarter transportation with fewer cars and greater access."" The most valuable company of its generation still has a siege mentality As agitprop, it’s all just fine, though you can’t help but wonder if Uber couldn’t have marshaled a slightly more celebratory air. The most valuable company of its generation still has a siege mentality, even despite its expensive (and effective!) new messaging portraying it as an unqualified public good. And Uber’s paranoia will do it good — no one wants to deliver a speech in front of a ""Mission Accomplished"" banner too soon. Ultimately, of course, Uber will be judged not on its theater but on whether Kalanick can deliver on his promises. In part, that will depend on whether riders feel good about taking his company’s cars. And little has happened in the past several months to shift opinion on that subject one way or another. So that part we’ll have to leave for the sequel. Kalanick finished his speech and smiled. Stevie Wonder’s ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered"" blared over the speakers. The CEO left the stage to a standing ovation and hugged his parents.",0.8527395565667729,0.14726044343322708,0.17483085629626846,1257,4.9347653142402548,671,6.216095380029806,0,4,"Business, Tech, Transportation, Report"

As noted by The Washington Post, the new agreement updates a clause that means PayPal can now contact you with ""autodialed or prerecorded calls and text messages,"" on numbers the company has ""otherwise obtained"" from other sources. While the new agreement sounds invasive, it should be noted that under the current document, PayPal could also technically obtain numbers from various sources. The existing agreement specifies that the ways users provided a telephone number ""include, but are not limited to"" providing a telephone number at account opening, adding a telephone number to your account later, giving it to an employee, or by using it to call PayPal. The new document expands on these specific examples, making it clear the company can also draw numbers from data lists and match them to users. The FCC might vote in rules banning PayPal's calls The updated user agreement is due to come into action on July 1st, but PayPal account owners may still be spared the irritation of sales calls entirely. The Federal Communications Commission proposed new rules last month to protect people against exactly the kind of spammy phone calls and text messages PayPal's terms enable. The strict rules would make it easier for people to opt out of sales calls by simply telling the salesperson to stop calling them, and would clarify the definition of an autodialer, making it tricky for companies to skirt the regulations. The commission is set to vote on the proposed rules on June 18th. If they are adopted by the FCC, then PayPal account owners in the US can breathe a sigh of relief, as they should make PayPal's plan to pester people with unwanted sales calls tricky to pull off legally. If they don't pass, then you'll have to trust the PayPal spokesperson who told The Verge that, in the US and UK, ""PayPal will honour any customers’ requests to decline to receive marketing outreach over the phone, SMS or email.""

According to the Financial Times, Apple plans to reduce its 30 percent fee for subscription music, video, and news apps. There's no detail on what the new model would look like, but it's almost certain that the move would be designed to curb concerns from regulators as Apple enters the subscription music business next week.  Forcing Spotify and Tidal to charge more would be a very bad look Not only does Apple take a 30 percent cut of all app purchases — an industry standard — it takes a 30 percent cut every month that a subscription renews as well. That means subscription services end up listing higher prices in the App Store in order to make the money that they need to stay afloat: Spotify and Tidal, for instance, charge $12.99 per month in the App Store but only $9.99 per month on their websites. That's a very bad look for Apple, especially if it rolls out a competing app at $9.99 per month. Subscription services have been complaining about Apple's cut, but only now is Apple really being put in a position where it might feel obligated to change it. Whatever Apple changes it to would have to be much smaller in order to satisfy streaming services — many just don't make enough money to be able to hand a significant amount over to Apple. Only charging these apps once or reducing the cut dramatically could make the model work. These changes will apparently apply not just to subscription music apps, but to video and news apps as well. Those apps face similar issues with the cut Apple takes. So while it may not be competing against subscription news and video apps directly — though you can easily make an argument for it — it's still a situation that needs to be addressed. The report doesn't say that Apple's cut of subscriptions could change for other apps, however, which means that Microsoft may still be stuck giving Apple a 30 percent cut of Office sales. Apple may also have to get more generous with the music labels if it actually wants to announce its subscription service on Monday. Bloomberg reported last night that labels are pushing for a larger revenue cut than they receive from Spotify — reportedly around 60 percent, up from Spotify's 55 percent. Apple isn't likely to love that arrangement, but it could help it look better when artists inevitably realize that they aren't getting paid very well from Apple's service either.",0.2850015430450062,0.7149984569549939,0.17908851650813487,457,4.62800875273523,251,5.3904382470119518,0,0,"Apple, Business, Tech"

The company held a big event last April to show off its Carousel app for photo management and the newly purchased Mailbox email app, but since then, it's been a year of refinements. And not coincidentally, many of those updates have centered on Dropbox for Business. After introducing the two-account setup that lets personal user accounts live alongside a Dropbox for your work, the company has focused on improvements that make Dropbox work better with Microsoft Office, an API to help big businesses integrate the service, and numerous other updates. Today, the company is announcing another set of updates for Dropbox for Business customers — and signaling its intentions to make ""DFB,"" as it's called internally, a major source of revenue. Currently, Dropbox has 300 million users (and just announced that its users have shared 2.1 billion files and folders), but the number of paying customers for Dropbox for Business is closer to 100,000. Meanwhile, DFB head of product Rob Baesman said that the company has identified about 4 million businesses using Dropbox in some form — either the free offering or the ""Dropbox Pro"" option that comes with 1TB of storage. Put those numbers together, and you can see there's a big opportunity for Dropbox for Business to find its way into the millions of companies where employees are already using the service. Dropbox seems to think its fortunes lie with big businesses The features announced today are seemingly focused on growing Dropbox's footprint among big enterprise customers, rather than the small- and medium-sized businesses that generally have less rigorous security standards. One such feature is tiered administrator accounts — rather than having a ""one size fits all"" administrator option, businesses can have multiple administrators at three different access levels, each with different clearances for what they are allowed to do within Dropbox.   Another new feature aimed at large organizations is support for Microsoft's Active Directory, a tool used for authenticating and authorizing users on a corporate network. Dropbox is now beta testing integration with Active Directory, which means a Dropbox business account can be simultaneously included when adding or removing users from a network. Once using Dropbox, companies also now have the option to make two-factor authentication a requirement, even if it wasn't turned on previously — users will be guided through the process the next time they access Dropbox. Dropbox’s increasing focus on the enterprise reflects a fact that should alarm investors in the company (valued at about $10 billion in January of 2014): as the price of storage falls, its core business of selling cloud-synced storage is more vulnerable every day. The company dropped prices to match other options like Google Drive in August of last year, but competitors like Microsoft’s OneDrive continue to undercut it. Just last week, Google introduced a photos product that made Carousel look like an also-ran overnight. Meanwhile, success in the enterprise is anything but assured. Box, which pivoted from consumer file storage to enterprise collaboration years ago, has struggled to persuade Wall Street of its long-term value since going public earlier this year. Among other problems: selling to enterprises is incredibly expensive. Box’s marketing expenses have so far prevented it from turning a profit. Will Dropbox's pivot to a business service go better than Box's did? Probably the biggest thing Dropbox has done yet to court enterprise is the DFB API it released back in December — today it is improving on it by adding a new shared folder API, which will let organizations better manage shared files and keep data that they might not want to share from getting out. ""Should a file look like it is troublesome for whatever reason,"" Baesman says, the shared-folder API ""can check on the sharing relationship surrounding that file and quickly shut down any sharing."" The goal is to contain the data, make sure it doesn't spread, and let IT personnel fix the problem. Making Dropbox for Business even easier for big companies to plug into will likely be a high priority for the company going forward. And if the company wants to eventually go public somewhere near the $10 billion it was valued at last year, it's going to be on the back of Dropbox for Business and growth with huge enterprise companies — so it's safe to assume we'll keep seeing a succession of incremental improvements for businesses. It might not be what gets consumers excited, but it is what Dropbox will need if it wants to go public.",0.4189977013088957,0.5810022986911043,0.5837090216889512,763,5.159895150720839,411,6.1800486618004866,0,2,"Business, Tech, Report"

Now, it's promising to respond to any petitions that meet its threshold within 60 days. In order to receive a response, a petition must hit 100,000 signatures within 30 days — a number that was raised from 30,000 in January of 2013. Under the new 60-day deadline, the process ""is going to look a little different,"" writes chief digital officer Jason Goldman. Based on the statement, that involves a new panel of people who will coordinate responses. And in a somewhat bigger change, massive petition site Change.org is now integrating with We the People, which means that signatures collected there can count towards the 100,000 total.

The new version will be ""quite different,"" according to a Commerce official quoted by PoliticoPro, and will be followed by a second round of public comments. First laid out in May, the Department of Commerce's new export rules were controversial from the start, with many in the security community saying the rules would make it impossible to develop and deploy benign security tools. Companies also raised concerns that the rules would hamper international bug bounties, which are now a common security practice among software vendors. Commerce held a two-month comment period on the proposed rules, in which time Google, Facebook, and dozens of other companies filed comments critical of the regulations as written. Now that the comment period is closed, it appears Commerce took those criticisms to heart. But while US regulators have hinted at significant revisions, it's unclear how they'll square the security world's objections with the country's larger international obligations. America signed on to the Wassenaar Arrangement in 2013, and while the exact regulations are open to interpretation, the arrangement obligates some form of new export control on intrusion software.

In a decision handed down Tuesday, the Hamburg data protection authority said Facebook's name policy violates German privacy laws, adding that the company cannot force users to submit photo identification or change their profile names without their consent. Facebook has come under increased criticism for its real name policy, with users complaining of having their accounts blocked or their names unilaterally changed. The company clarified its policy in March, saying that users are free to choose their ""authentic identity"" — the name they go by in real life, which may not be the name that appears on their official ID. ""If you like our game, you must play by our rules."" But Facebook still requires users to confirm their names with accepted forms of identification, which Germany's watchdog considers a violation of privacy. In the Hamburg case, a woman who tried to use a Facebook under an alias filed a complaint after the company blocked her account and requested a copy of her ID, before changing her name without her permission. Facebook's privacy policy has come under fire from regulators across Europe, though the company has long argued that it should only be held to privacy laws in Ireland, where its European operations are headquartered. Johannes Caspar, Hamburg commissioner for data protection and freedom of information, rejected that argument this week, saying: ""Facebook has economic activity in Germany with its branch in Hamburg. So: if you like our game, you must play by our rules."" Facebook defended its policy in a statement following the Hamburg decision, saying it enhances safety and transparency.

Palmer, whose name was first reported by The Telegraph on Tuesday, traveled to Zimbabwe earlier this month, where he killed Cecil the lion with a bow and arrow after luring the animal out of a national park. The 13-year-old lion had been part of an Oxford University study, and was one of the most popular animals at Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park. Palmer and the people he paid to organize the hunt allegedly used bait to lure Cecil outside of the park before killing, beheading, and skinning the animal. News of Cecil's death elicited swift condemnation from conservation groups. “Actions, like these, are quickly pushing imperiled species toward extinction,"" Jeff Flocken, North American regional director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said in a statement. ""So long as a value continues to be placed on these animals, where they are worth more dead than alive, the future of majestic creatures like elephants, lions, tigers and rhinos will remain in grave jeopardy."" ""Brought my lion here for dentistry and was horrified by the result."" The hunt has also sparked anger online, with some internet users posting scathing or sarcastic reviews on the Yelp page for Palmer's dentistry practice.

Several Facebook pages bearing the name of Palmer's practice, River Bluff Dental, have also been created to criticize the dentist's hunting habits. Palmer has been unabashed about his love for big game hunting in the past, posing with a leopard he killed in Zimbabwe and paying $45,000 at an auction to kill an elk. In a statement this week, the dentist and father of two said he regrets killing Cecil, adding that he thought his guides were organizing a legal hunt. ""I hired several professional guides, and they secured all proper permits,"" Palmer said. ""To my knowledge, everything about this trip was legal and properly handled.""

Actually, it’s more of a quiet whirr followed by a less quiet thunk as plastic meets plaster wall, followed by a brief intermission where my aural focus shifts to the various emotive beeps emanating from my phone’s speaker.  This may be the oddest way to “enjoy” a toy — it’s certainly one of the most passive — but Sphero’s BB-8 isn’t a toy so much as it is a very simple robot performer with Pixar-esque aspirations. The $149.99 droid will go on sale starting this Friday at Apple’s retail stores, Best Buy, and Sphero’s own website (don’t worry, it’s Android compatible, too). That’s a pretty hefty price tag, but Sphero’s BB-8 is offering something few Star Wars toys have been able to pull off: it captures the personality of the droid, and it speaks volumes to where Sphero wants to try and push robotics in the future. If trailers are meant to generate hype for a film, a Star Wars trailer serves to tease an entire cross-media entertainment platform. Since the beginning, the mythos of Star Wars has been equal parts on-screen movie magic and off-screen merchandising. In the ‘70s and ‘80s, it was largely dominated by Kenner action figures, and though Star Wars merchandising has remained a massive force — in 2011 alone, the license made an estimated $3 billion — this year is poised to be exceptionally large, thanks in no small part to The Force Awakens, the first new Star Wars film since 2005’s Revenge of the Sith. The hot new items from those Force Awakens trailers? A cross-guard lightsaber and a really cute soccer ball with a robot head. It’s a big enough moment in Star Wars fandom that Disney has made a global event out of unboxing all the tie-in toys — an event that is being branded as ""Force Friday."" But while this kind of fanfare is maybe old hat for Hasbro and Lego, it’s a fairly new feeling for Sphero. The company was founded in 2010 (then called Orbotix) and has released a handful of products since: the titular Sphero (an orb you can control with your phone), the cylindrical bot Ollie, and a few variations of each — all intriguing ideas, but nothing that found mainstream commercial success. With the BB-8 toy, that’s all about to change. Sphero’s collaboration with Disney began last summer when it joined the Disney Accelerator program. It’s a rather odd move for a four-year-old company with commercially released products, but it was clearly a smart one. As chief creative officer Rob Maigret tells us, one of Sphero’s mentors was none other than Disney CEO Bob Iger, who has shown a knack for acquiring strong (read: profitable) talent, including Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. (Maigret himself was the other mentor, joining the company after the program.) At their first meeting, Iger (reportedly) showed the Sphero co-founders a picture of BB-8 and challenged them to make a working version, which the duo (again, reportedly) managed to conceptualize in about 24 hours’ time. (The version on film, however, is more puppetry than robotics.)   As with past Sphero products, your smartphone is essential to interacting with BB-8: all interfacing (and indeed all of the sound effects) happens via an iOS or Android device. BB-8 can be imprecise — I dare say ""moody"" — in how it responds to manual driving. That’s especially true when you first get it moving; there seems to be a preprogrammed maneuver where it goes backwards for a few seconds too long, as if it’s ""winding up"" to move (and to be fair, this thing's top speed is pretty damn fast). Once it’s in motion, however, steering becomes fairly intuitive. BB-8 also has several patterns you can trigger, such as a figure eight, but more importantly, it can be prompted to convey several ""emotions"" like nodding yes, shaking its head no, and something that’s either joy or panic, I’m still not sure which. You can reportedly use voice commands to drive it as well, although we couldn’t get it to work in the early build of the app we used. Then there’s patrol mode. Left to its own devices, BB-8 wanders around the room without directive. It doesn’t have a camera (again, the head is just plastic), so for the most part it’ll just drive around until it hits a wall, act pissy (that’s my interpretation at least), and then go another direction. I wouldn’t recommend letting it on tables or other elevated surfaces, but if you do, it's worth noting that the thing's been pretty durable so far. (Its effectiveness on carpet is variable, pending your floor fabric of choice.) Sphero makes a lot of bold claims on the packaging, chief among them ""holographic communication,"" but really it’s just an augmented reality video — either of an X-Wing model or some small video you record with a front-facing camera — that you can see by pointing. It’s cute, but you’ll probably only try it once. But for all the added bells and whistles, the BB-8's primary directive is really just to be a ball of cuteness — to make you feel something and ascribe emotion to an algorithmically driven device. Even when you’re not using BB-8, the droid will start looking around, as if it’s impatiently waiting for you to give it directions. The first time I set it down in its charging stand, it suddenly began ""looking around,"" twisting and moving its head erratically as if it’s trying to ascertain its environment. It was a jarring moment for myself and a few other co-workers, too, but it speaks to Sphero’s renewed focus on giving its products personality.   ""We think this is probably the first step for Sphero,"" said Maigret, reflecting on the company’s rather ambitious goals for the future. ""We think that ultimately there will be a robot in every house — that everyone will own a companion."" Maigret knows those dreams are a ways off, but you can see the very, very early roots of those ideas in BB-8. As a new tier of Star Wars merchandising, the droid stands out as a desirable and capable. There’s something earnestly fascinating about seeing it go off on its own. I can’t say how long that novelty will last, but I could easily see myself turning it on autopilot and enjoying the occasional moment where I catch it doing something weird and cute. It's kind of like a cat, in that respect. But BB-8 also represents something new for Star Wars merchandising. Sure, other tie-ins over the years have hit or even exceeded the $150 mark, but in many ways, this feels like a different kind of luxury item — one, perhaps, for the generations that remember seeing Star Wars in theaters (be it Original Trilogy or the Prequels) and have a bit of disposable income now. This isn't a static action figure; Sphero's BB-8 is designed to move and emote even when you’re not actively engaging with it, which ultimately is the reason to consider it. And who knows? By the time Episode XXIV hits theaters, maybe we will have autonomous robot friends. For now, though, it’s just a ball of cuteness — a weirdly interesting ball of cuteness, though.

It’s become a major part of the organization’s media advocacy over the last decade — and after this year, it’s being replaced. When GLAAD published its first Network Responsibility Index (NRI) in 2007, it was with the understanding that the medium hadn’t always done a great job depicting the lives of LGBT people. They were ignored for years, then treated as pariahs, tokens, and caricatures for decades. The mission of the NRI was to  ""evaluate the quantity and quality of images of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people on television,"" and it consisted of a report on five broadcast networks and a one-page summary of representation on cable. At the time, ABC led all of its peers with 15 percent of its total primetime programming being rated as inclusive; the great majority of all LGBT characters were white, male, and gay. The recent improvement in TV's inclusivity is staggering When this year’s results are compared to those figures, the improvement is staggering on multiple fronts; a fascinating snapshot of an industry that’s become much more inclusive over the last decade. The least inclusive broadcast network (CBS) was at 27 percent, almost twice as much as ABC in 2007. The highest-rated networks, FOX and the CW, managed to render almost half of their programming LGBT-friendly. The scope of GLAAD’s coverage has expanded, too: it has added 10 selected cable networks and 16 other minor cable channels and streaming services to its report. According to its findings, all of the networks are more diverse along lines of gender identity and race, and they’re starting to incorporate trans characters in small proportions. They’re also less reliant on stereotypes than they used to be: instead of using LGBT people as vehicles for people’s hatred, joke fodder, or one-trick ponies, they work as doctors, professors, and policemen. At their best, they’re fully realized characters whose sexual orientation or gender identity just constitutes one piece of their personal puzzle. The NRI has reflected tremendous change over the last decade — and has helped to convince networks of the validity and value of LGBT-inclusive programming. So why is GLAAD leaving it in the past? GLAAD is focusing on reports that are ""more detailed and granular."" ""Over the years, we’ve seen a remarkable increase in LGBT representation on most of the TV networks we track in our report,"" says Matt Kane, GLAAD’s programs director for entertainment media. ""We may have the numbers, but [networks] still aren’t quite representing the LGBT community in a way that’s accurate… There are still people who are starved for representation in popular culture."" Having achieved some progress on a quantitative level, GLAAD is focusing its efforts on broadening the kinds of LGBT people depicted on TV, namely people of color and transgender people. The NRI is a macro-level analysis, one that’s not particularly well suited for those tasks; the organization can get more done with reports like Where We Are on TV and Transgender Images on TV, documents Kane calls ""more detailed and granular."" The NRI is also ill-equipped to deal with both new technology and the impact of LGBT inclusivity on a given show’s performance, two objects of interest for GLAAD. Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu are all mentioned in passing in the 2015 NRI, but they merit more intense coverage given the scale of their original programming arms; together, they also produce some of the most obviously inclusive shows currently airing, including Orange Is the New Black and Transparent. ""That’s one of the things we’ve been thinking about, and I don’t think the NRI is useful when it comes to addressing what’s on streaming services,"" says Kane. ""We’ve been impressed by the majority of the LGBT-inclusive programming we’ve seen on those services."" The NRI also fails to shed light on the existence of a relationship between LGBT inclusivity and ratings, data GLAAD could use when dealing with networks. Finally, the NRI can’t account for the tone or content of storylines involving LGBT characters or performers. A good example from this year’s reports involves televisual whoopie cushion Two and a Half Men: the show is counted as part of CBS’s inclusive portfolio because of a storyline in which Walden (Ashton Kutcher) and Alan (Jon Cryer) pretend to be a married gay couple to facilitate an adoption. Many of TV's best shows are impossible to imagine without LGBT components The NRI may have outlived its usefulness, but it has served as a valuable metric and catalyst for network action over the last decade. After flipping through all nine reports, I couldn’t help but feel excited about the progress that’s been made in terms of LGBT representation; I felt hopeful about my TV becoming more diverse and richer in trans characters and stories in the years to come. Some of my favorite shows are impossible to imagine without LGBT components. An Empire without the relationship between homophobic patriarch Lucious Lyon and his son Jamal would be a soap opera without a heart; an Orange Is the New Black without inmates of every race, gender identity, and orientation would be sterile and sleepy. And even after a decade, GLAAD has just one simple request for TV creators: ""Use some forethought and care when you’re including a LGBT character,"" says Kane. ""It’s not enough to check off that box. They need to be fully realized, multi-dimensional people that all audiences can find some commonality with.""",0.8829408826794416,0.1170591173205584,0.8235295263966554,927,5.1736785329018335,487,6.4086242299794662,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Report, TV"

(Its free version, also called Hulu, will continue to exist alongside its premium subscription options.) The split has been rumored for months, with a July Wall Street Journal report nailing both the potential price and release date of Hulu's ad-free tier. The company's decision to split their premium business into two different options is arriving in the midst of a major drive for new content — and a subsequent increase in complaints about the service's mandatory commercials.

It’s like creating a new card game: those 52 cards are something that everyone understands, the trick is to use them in new ways.   Mario Maker does something that will probably annoy a lot of people: it locks much of the game creation tools away at the beginning, and forces you to play regularly in order to access them. At the start, you have goombas and mushrooms and basic platforms, but if you want warp pipes or boo ghosts you’ll need to play at least five minutes each day for a week to unlock it all. This isn’t as bad as it sounds. The limitations actually keep you from being overwhelmed by choice. Making a level is hard and time consuming, and Mario Maker’s structure forces you to learn the basics before you mess around with the more complicated toys. By the time you get to the really good stuff, you'll be prepared to use it properly. The iPhone introduced a whole new world of people to video games, and one of the key reasons is its touchscreen, which makes on-screen interactions more intuitive. Mario Maker definitely benefits from this as well. There’s really no easier way to make a level than to simply drag and draw objects where you want them. And when you simplify that process, it frees you up to try crazier things; I made all kinds of elaborate platforming sequences, and it was incredibly easy to put them together. Of course, it still takes time to get things perfect, but the process has been streamlined a lot, so tweaking a level doesn’t feel like a chore.  Mario Maker doesn't make you wait until your level is finished to play it: at all times there’s a ""play"" button in the lower left corner of the screen, and tapping lets you play whatever you’ve built so far, no matter how incomplete it is. This helps you test things that might not work. If you need to know if a jump is too high for Mario, you can try it right away. If the number of enemies looks like it might be overwhelming, it will take you just a few seconds to test that out for yourself. The same goes for the different themes. You can make your level look like any number of classic Mario games — from the NES original to New Super Mario Bros. — and switching the visual style happens immediately, letting you test different looks painlessly.   Mario Maker is a game about making things, but it’s also about playing. Because of this, the whole experience of building a level from scratch is incredibly playful. It’s all in the little touches: the undo button is a cute dog, and when you drag enemies from the menu to the actual level you’ll see their little legs wiggle in the air. If you try to use the eraser on Mario he’ll start to sweat. Every so often you’ll see bugs on the screen, and if you tap them you’ll be transported to the ""Gnat Attack"" mini-game from the NES classic Mario Paint. These tiny, wonderful details turn what could’ve been a boring series of menus into something much more approachable. Even playing levels made by other people has a design benefit, as it gives you new ideas for how to use the tools at hand.

But then, just like it did above the gaping maw of the Sarlacc in Tatooine's Dune Sea, it all went wrong for Fett. Director Josh Trank left the project earlier this year, leaving Boba's biopic floating in space, waiting for someone to kickstart the engines and take the helm. Eric Demeusy could be that person. The filmmaker has produced a Fett fan film, a 90-second trailer that shows how stylish the spinoff movie could be. In the clip, Fett has escaped from the horrible sphincter-mouth of the Sarlacc, crawled out of the Great Pit of Carkoon, and is keen to make his way back into the galaxy. He's not looking bad for a man who's spent three decades being injected with neurotoxins and marinating in stomach acid — thanks, probably, in part to his famously hard-wearing Mandalorian armor. A Boba Fett movie was reportedly scheduled to premiere in 2018 Where many other fan films reuse footage from previous episodes, the trailer for the unofficial New Republic Anthology looks and sounds almost as good as the trailer for The Force Awakens, using movie-grade computer effects to show off both the Sarlacc and Fett's Slave One spaceship. Demeusy has experience in the field — he's worked on visual effects for Pacific Rim and helped produce the iconic Game of Thrones intro sequence — but while his graphics are great, his story might need still need some fine-tuning. Demeusy's take on the Fett film would be set 30 years after Return of the Jedi, around the same time as the upcoming The Force Awakens is set to take place. It's a clever idea to tie Fett to the Sarlacc at the start of the movie. Fett falls into the pit three times in the old expanded universe (suggesting that that perhaps that he's not the kind of man who should be trusted with a jetpack), but slightly less believable is that the apolitical Fett would, as Demeusy suggests, go on to help found the New Republic.

You can check it out for yourself by opting into the beta channel in Steam’s preferences, but here’s the main change in the tweaked Big Picture mode: a much-improved way to navigate your sprawling library of games that you will probably never get around to playing. The new Library section, and much of the rest of the interface, seems to take influence from living room media center software such as Plex by using a left-aligned column to sort everything into simple categories. The first thing you see when choosing Library from the largely unchanged Start screen is a page called “Resume and Explore,” which gives you a quick way to access games you’ve recently been playing, as well as games in your library that your friends are also into — though the bar seems to be pretty low, as many titles that only one or two friends own popped up for me.  Elsewhere, there are reformed search modes for both your library and the store, which pop up potential results as you type, sort of like predictive text for PC games. Individual game pages have also undergone a reshuffle, with a similar left column to the Library view letting you access DLC and other options. Overall, browsing your library is much smoother and logical than the previous version's unadulterated stream of content, and it might just help you find something new. The new interface is still a little buggy — that’s what the beta channel’s for, after all. I saw UI elements rendered halfway off the screen in the Windows version, and while the Mac client seemed more visually stable sometimes it’d load as a black screen or crash altogether. The UI is also clearly targeting 16:9 TVs above all else, as it shows black bars on my 1920 x 1200 monitors. But it’s clear Valve is thinking hard about how to make PC gaming easier from the couch, and hopefully the issues will be ironed out in time for the Steam Controller’s launch. A Steam Machine may not be a wise purchase for now, but more and more people may find that it's not the worst idea in the world to just hook up a PC to your TV.

Update: Read the iPhone 6S review. But where does the extra heft come from? You might suspect that the stronger, aerospace-grade aluminum alloy used in the 6S is to blame, but you'd be wrong. The exact mixture of Apple's customized aluminum alloy is unknown, but the 7000-series alloys are only very slightly more dense than 6000-series mixtures, the type which was reportedly used in the iPhone 6. The difference between the two is the alloying elements: 7000 series is primarily alloyed with zinc, compared to magnesium and silicon in 6000 series aluminum.   New aluminum alloy is just about as dense as before According to Apple, the aluminum in the 6S Plus only weighs 2 grams more than the aluminum in its predecessor. The aluminum in the 6S weighs a gram less than that in the 6. So, the new aluminum might keep iPhones from bending in half, but it's not to blame for the weight gain. It turns out the extra heft comes almost solely from that new 3D Touch display. The display assembly now weighs over twice as much as before. In the 6, the display used to weigh 12 grams — it now weighs 29 grams. That's because Apple had to add an entirely new layer to its display assembly to measure pressure. There's a new capacitive pressure sensor built into the backlight of the display; as rumored, it makes the screen slightly thicker and quite a bit heavier.   At the end of the day, the 6S and 6S Plus only weigh 14 and 20 grams more than the models they replace, respectively. That's not going to make a major difference day to day, but it's nice to know where that extra weight is coming from. Now, if only Apple would add a bit more weight in order to bump up the battery life — that's a tradeoff we'd all be willing to make. Thanks, Anonymous!

The key is that Microsoft is trying to experiment with a lot of different ideas on mobile instead of betting the farm on some big concept (like it did with Windows 8). So it has its own lock screen on Android that focuses on showing contextually relevant apps and faster access to stuff like making conference calls. Echo is slightly different, it lets you only wake the screen for prioritized apps and snooze those notifications for later. Both are sets of good ideas for your lock screen, but combining them could end up being a mess. But that's not the goal anyway. Instead, Microsoft apparently wants to see how users interact with these apps for its own research — not just to create the One True Android Lock Screen App (yet). What it learns there could make it back to its core products, like Windows 10 or Outlook.

I’m not talking about the purposely-added shake you see in Bourne Identity fight scenes — rather, the little bumps and wobbles that DSLRs and phone cameras are so bad at hiding. They're the kind of thing you may not even explicitly notice, but it's the easiest way to tell if you're dealing with footage shot by a pro or an amateur. That’s why our entire staff — video team included — was so excited when we found out that Instagram's Hyperlapse app actually did an incredible job of stabilizing video. Now, a company called SteadXP is looking to sell a third-party solution that brings the smarts of Hyperlapse to almost any camera you’d like to use. What makes the stabilization so good is how it works — more specifically, how it works differently from stabilization software like you'd find built into Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere, or other stand-alone stabilization applications.  Those all analyze a scene after it was shot, meaning the software has to latch on to many parts of the image to figure out what motion should be smoothed out. Hyperlapse — and now SteadXP — are recording data in real time with the footage being captured, meaning there's no guesswork involved. In the end, you wind up with much more accurate stabilization. If that still doesn't make sense, here's our video explainer when we got our hands on Hyperlapse last year:  SteadXP is essentially a tiny box that houses an accelerometer and gyroscope, and when you attach it to your camera it can record your camera's movements as you shoot. You then take the footage to your computer, where SteadXP's software matches up the stabilization information. The company has actually created two models: one that plugs right into the back of a GoPro (Hero 2 and higher) and another that can hook into the hot shoe of a DSLR or professional cinema camera. There are different stabilization profiles for filming fast action, one for locking onto the horizon, a mode for shooting hyperlapses, and ones calibrated for things like handheld or shoulder-mounted footage. SteadXP has a number of sample videos available on the Kickstarter page, and the results look pretty wild. But it’s important to note that image stabilization is a feature that many of the biggest camera companies are rushing to build into their cameras. Sony already has 5-axis image stabilization working on a couple of its full-frame A7 cameras, including the video-first Sony A7s II. Many others are close behind. SteadXP's stabilization only happens along three axes, and while it looks like it could be a decent solution in the short term, it has tough competition waiting on the horizon. for vid people this is the most important kickstarter prob ever https://t.co/HXC7vPCs5Z i want this so bad. ya'll have no idea  You could say that Ryan Manning, one of The Verge's video directors, is excited.

AMD greatly inhibits Flynn's eyesight, limiting his view to just his peripheral vision. ""I'm unable to put the numbers in for my card when paying in a shop or at the bank, and although I was a keen gardener, I can't tell the weeds from the flowers anymore,"" Flynn told BBC News. The system works by providing electrical stimulation to the damaged retina Flynn is part of a clinical trial at Manchester Clinical Research Facility that will implant the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System into five patients with age-related macular degeneration. The Argus II — developed by US-based health care company Second Sight — has been used before to help those suffering from a rare condition known as retinitis pigmentosa. But Flynn became the first patient ever with AMD to receive the Argus II after a four-hour surgery at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital last month.  The system works by providing electrical stimulation to the damaged retina. Flynn must wear special glasses with a built-in video camera that rests in front of his right ear. The visual information gathered by the camera is wirelessly transmitted to the implant on the eye, which then uses electrodes to stimulate the retinal cells. That allows the eye to send the necessary visual signals to the brain for interpretation. Two weeks after surgery, Flynn tested out the implant by looking at a series of black and white bars on a computer screen. With the Argus II system, he was able to tell when the bars were patterned vertically, horizontally, and diagonally. While Flynn can't see things as crisply as he did before his diagnosis, he'll now be able to make out distinct shapes like door frames. With the success of Flynn's surgery, the researchers hope the device will help others suffering from AMD to see again. But with a total price tag of more than $230,000, it's doubtful the Argus II will be a realistic option for patients any time soon.",0.4796444426704618,0.5203555573295382,0.8772486770614204,441,4.8730158730158726,246,5.8292682926829267,0,0,Science

The Real-time Anti-Poaching Intelligence Device (RAPID) was developed by Protect, a British nonprofit focused on conservation and animal welfare. The device is already being tested in South Africa, where rhino populations are under threat from poachers seeking their valuable horns. The system, which was spearheaded by biologist Paul O'Donoghue, relies on heart rate monitors embedded under the skin of rhinos. If the animal's heart rate suddenly elevates or plummets, RAPID will send an alert to operators at a control center, who can then remotely activate a tiny camera implanted into the rhino's horn. A leather collar around the animal's neck also tracks its GPS coordinates, allowing park authorities to quickly deploy anti-poaching forces if the live camera footage suggests that it's being attacked. The hope is that once the system is widely deployed, poachers will learn to avoid any rhino wearing the distinctive GPS collar. ""It acts as a deterrent so that poachers realize that any animal that’s got one of these collars or units attached to it is basically off the list,"" says Steve Piper, a director at Protect. ""There's no point in attacking it, there’s no point in killing it, because you're never going to get away with the valuable parts of the animal.""   Rhino poaching has risen sharply in recent years, particularly in South Africa, home to the largest rhinoceros population in the world. More than 1,200 were killed in South Africa last year, according to government figures, equating to one rhino every eight hours. Criminal syndicates target the animal for its horn, which commands high prices in Asia for its perceived medicinal benefits. Some governments have de-horned rhinos to deter poachers, though that requires constant monitoring, and it hasn't always proven effective. More recently, conservationists have begun using drones and microchip implants to enhance surveillance of threatened populations. The missing link? RAPID provides a ""missing link,"" Piper says, because it allows authorities at national parks and reserves to instantly pinpoint the location of a rhino under threat. The system's three components communicate wirelessly, and the heart monitor's battery would only have to be replaced a few times over the course of a rhino's lifetime. The embedded camera also poses no risk to the rhino's health, and can be implanted painlessly. ""You're looking at a fraction of a second from a rhino getting stressed or upset to the alarm being raised,"" Piper says. ""So there’s really no opportunity for poachers to cut off [the horn]."" Protect will deploy more prototype systems over the coming months, in the hopes of launching it more widely by late 2016. In the meantime, it will explore ways to explore alternative ways to power the heart monitor battery, including solar and kinetic energy. The organization says RAPID could also be adapted to other threatened species such as elephants, lions, or even whales. A version for tigers, Piper says, is already in development.

The camera is centered on Central America, with much of North and South America blanketed in cloud, and the shallow seas around the Caribbean showing up as turquoise streaks in a deeper blue.

Sunburst Sensors won both of the grand prize purses for affordability and accuracy — worth $750,000 each. Team ANB Sensors took home the second place prize for affordability, receiving $250,000, and Team Durafet was awarded the second place prize for accuracy, also receiving $250,000.  The XPRIZE Foundation aims to cultivate technologies that fulfill a beneficial need for humanity Sunburst Sensors LLC is a small Montana-based company that makes sensors for marine and freshwater applications. Their products work by drawing in water samples and then mixing them with purified dyes. The sensor then shines a laser on the mixture to determine the water’s pH. It’s a process known as spectrophotometry — a way of figuring out the structure of a substance by measuring its capacity to absorb light. James Beck, CEO of Sunburst Sensors, says the double win came as a complete surprise, and he's excited to put the funds toward developing new technology. ""We're a 10-person company, so we don't have the resources of a lot of these teams,"" said Beck. ""So we're going to be able to do some things we haven't been able to do."" The XPRIZE Foundation is a nonprofit that hopes to foster innovation and technology development through public competitions. The organization aims to cultivate technologies that fulfill a beneficial need for humanity. The contests offer monetary rewards from backers including Google and Qualcomm to people who create the best technology that fits within each competition’s guidelines. The Wendy Schmidt Ocean Health XPRIZE tasked teams with developing the most accurate and most affordable technologies for measuring widespread ocean acidification — a problem that has grown substantially during the 21st century.   James Beck is the CEO of Sunburst Sensors, LLC. (XPRIZE Foundation) The problem The competition was launched in 2013 as a way to address decreasing pH levels in the world's oceans. This ocean acidification is a byproduct of more and more carbon dioxide being added to the atmosphere each year. Around a quarter of added carbon dioxide dissolves into the ocean and forms carbonic acid. This influx of carbonic acid changes the chemistry of the oceans, resulting in more acidic waters. The Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii estimated that at the start of 2015, the global concentration of CO2 reached a total of 400 parts per million (ppm) — the highest levels in recorded history. And the higher these levels increase, the more acidic our oceans get. Scientists estimate that since 1800, 48 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions stemming from fossil fuel burning and cement manufacture have dissolved into the oceans. For the past 300 million years, the ocean’s pH has averaged out to 8.2. Today’s average hovers around 8.1, resulting in a loss of .1 pH. That small factor translates into a 30 percent increase of ocean acidity. It’s not just CO2, either. Another phenomenon called coastal acidification is also a growing concern. That occurs when nutrient-dense pollution — such as sewage or fertilizers— runs off into coastal waters, causing large blooms of algae. Microorganisms then feast on this algae — sucking up oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide at the same time. This also lowers pH levels.     A sea butterfly (pteropod) shell placed in increasingly acidic seawater slowly dissolves over 45 days. (David Littschwager / National Geographic Society) Of course, raising the ocean’s acidity harms sea life. Numerous species of plants and animals build their shells and skeletons out of a chalk-like compound called calcium carbonate, but acidic waters actively break down this important ingredient. ""This is everything from scallops and clams to corals and lots of different types of plankton you’ve never heard of,"" Scott Doney, chair of the marine chemistry and geochemistry department at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, tells The Verge. ""Acidic conditions make it harder for those organisms to build their shells. It’s still possible, but the plant or animal has to devote more energy to it."" Because shell production is more energy-intensive, younger shellfish are having a tougher time growing — and surviving. It's a trend that's causing widespread deaths of marine plant and animal life, endangering coastal communities that rely heavily on these creatures as a source of food. Acidification’s effects also devastate the livelihoods of more than 470 million people working in the seafood industry, which is starting to experience lower yields of fish and other marine life. ""Oyster hatchery businesses on the West Coast in Oregon and Washington state, they saw their stocks basically collapse,"" says Doney. ""The water was too acidic that they were bringing into the hatcheries.""   Testing the XPRIZE teams' sensors (XPRIZE Foundation) A better thermometer Regulatory agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency are working to cut carbon emissions by placing new standards on the fossil fuel and automobile industries — big producers of CO2. But marine communities and businesses still need to determine just how acidic the oceans in their regions have become. The traditional way of figuring this out is laborious and time-consuming: You must go out to sea, collect small samples, and send them to a lab for processing. This is both expensive and ineffective at providing wide-scale measurements, according to Doney. Current methods also mostly analyze waters at the ocean's surface, leaving deep sea pH levels unmeasured. The world's oceans are sick, and we don’t have a very good thermometer In other words, the world's oceans are sick, and we don’t have a very good thermometer. That makes it incredibly difficult to know which waters are the most affected. ""Without the measurements, we’re sort of blind,"" Doney says.  ""It’s very hard to manage something that you don’t measure."" That piqued the XPRIZE Foundation’s interest. Paul Bunje, senior director of the Wendy Schmidt Ocean Health XPRIZE, said the organization saw a critical need for affordable technologies that can measure ocean pH in real time. ""The tiniest amount of change in pH can mean the difference between life and death,"" says Bunje. ""If your blood pH changes that much, it’s the difference between life and death."" Bunje says the competition was meant to capitalize on emerging sensor technologies that can provide accurate results without the need of extensive lab analysis. Many of the submitted sensors use existing pH-measuring technology, such as measuring the water's electrical potential or chemical compositions. But the sensors needed to be incorporated into designs that could be used easily out at sea and survive deep ocean depths. The nonprofit also wanted to foster the production of not only accurate sensors, but ones that can be purchased much more cheaply. ""Current technologies can cost upwards of $15,000, so that’s a lot. If you're going deep sea, it’s not the device you're going to buy,"" says Bunje. ""The affordability purse had a threshold cost of $1,000; that’s very low. There, we awarded a significant number of points the cheaper you got below that level.""   The five finalist teams (XPRIZE Foundation) After a year and a half, the XPRIZE Foundation was able to slim down the 24 teams to five finalists hailing from four different countries. The finalists had to endure various stages of real-world testing, including tests of their sensors in coastal waters as well as the daunting final stage: the deep sea trials. In May, all five teams boarded the R/V Kilo Moana, a US Navy research ship, and sailed off the coast of Oahu, Hawaii. There, the sensors were submerged to a depth of 1.87 miles to see if they could withstand 300 atmospheres of pressure and still provide accurate results. Though Sunburst Sensors took home both of the grand prizes, Bunje says the real winners of the competition are those involved in the ocean community. Now, a once-sparse technological domain has a diverse range of sensor technologies for marine biologists, oceanographers, and others to exploit. ""We're proving there’s a lot more ingenuity out there that wants to be applied to these problems,"" says Bunje. ""There is real value in creating even better devices, and there are markets for it. Aquariums and small science centers have been calling us up constantly, asking us, 'When are these technologies going to be ready?'""",0.7644961562738924,0.23550384372610755,0.839171744951695,1393,5.2548456568557071,704,6.5085227272727275,0,8,"Science, Report"

That's a significant drop, compared with rates seen in the late '80s. And the teen birth rate has dropped by 57 percent since 1991. That said, teenagers still aren't using the most effective contraceptive, the IUD. And the US teen birth rate remains higher than that of other developed countries. There were 273,105 teen births in the US in 2013. And unfortunately, teen childbearing can have some pretty negative effects on parents and their kids. For example, kids who are born from teenaged mothers are more likely to suffer from health problems, or drop out of high school; and only half of teen mothers receive a high school diploma before they turn 22. In addition, teen childbearing costs the public a total of about $9.4 billion a year, partly because of the cost of health care services and foster care. That's why figuring out when teenagers start having sex, and what contraceptive methods they're using matters; it's the kind of information that can be used to tailor interventions toward those who need them the most. 273,105 teen births in the US in 2013 In the study, scientists surveyed a little over 2,000 boys and girls aged 15 to 19, between 2011 and 2013. To increase the size of their sample, the researchers also asked 1,770 young adults between the age of 20 and 24 about their teen sex life. The results showed a pretty large decline in the proportion of teens who had had sex by the time they turned 20. Overall, 47 percent of boys and 44 percent of girls aged 15 to 19 reported having sex at least once — down from 60 percent of boys and 51 percent of girls in 1988. For both boys and girls surveyed, the percentage of teens who reported having sex was slightly higher than in the CDC's 2010 report, but that difference wasn't statistically significant. This means that the proportion of kids having sex before they hit their 20s is pretty stable right now.     Of course, because these numbers are polled together, they don't tell the whole story. For example, 18 percent of boys and 13 percent of girls said they had experienced sexual intercourse before their 15th birthday. And by the time teenagers turned 19, a little over two-thirds of unmarried teens have had sex at least once.     Only 3 percent of teen girls used an IUD The study also showed that teenagers still prefer condoms over other contraceptives; 97 percent of teens reported using them. That said, the use of emergency contraception — also called the ""morning-after pill"" — by female teenagers increased to 22 percent in 2013, from 8 percent in 2002. As for the IUD, the proportion of young women who had ever used the device stayed largely the same compared with data from 2010, at around 3 percent. That's unfortunate; the IUD is the best contraceptive for teens, according to the CDC. Unsurprisingly, age had a pretty large effect on contraceptive use. Only 77 percent of girls who had sex before they turned 18 used contraception, for instance — compared with 93 percent of 18- to 19-year-old girls. And about 82 percent of boys age 17 or younger said that they used contraception, compared with 99 percent of 18- to 19-year-olds. Thus, a 17-year-old girl is five times more likely to have given birth if she didn't use contraception the first time she had sex, compared with a girl who did. That's why making sure that teenagers have access to contraceptive methods early on is so important. We already know teens are having sex at an early age; more targeted interventions could help them avoid unwanted pregnancies.",0.45778274842495514,0.5422172515750449,0.6683421781960573,650,4.6646153846153844,312,5.4358974358974361,0,4,"Science, US & World"

Previous research — in placebo-controlled trials — showed that the treatment didn’t work, mainly because participants didn’t take their pills. A recent study of 5,000 women in Zimbabwe, for instance, showed that less than 40 percent of the blood samples taken in the study contained detectable levels of the drug. As a result, some scientists speculated that false rumors about the drug's safety and lack of social support — combined with the possibility that the women had been assigned a placebo — may have discouraged the women from taking the drug. Many scientists hoped that this trend would change if women were guaranteed that the drug was the real thing. Now, it appears that these suggestions may have been correct. Today's CDC-led study showed high levels of the drug in the participants' blood, including in the women. A total of 229 heterosexual individuals in Botswana were enrolled in the trial, a little over half of whom were men. The participants in the trial already knew a lot about the drug, because they had all participated in a previous, placebo-controlled trial. The researchers followed the participants for a period of 12 months, and at the end of the trial no one had contracted HIV. The participants who stayed in the trial and had their blood sampled — 120 total — had a high level of oral PrEP in their blood, and 58 percent said they took the drug regularly.  ""These results are very exciting and encouraging as to the real life use of PrEP in women,"" says Erika Aaron, an adult nurse practitioner at Drexel University who didn't work on this trial. ""It may be that there is an increased awareness of the risk factors for women and the use of PrEP in these communities."" It follows that this information would lead to improved adherence, she says. The population studied was ""highly selected."" The population studied raises some questions about how reproducible these results might be. For one, the study was small; the researchers only collected blood from 120 participants. For another, all of the participants were familiar with the drug, having already gone through a previous trial. ""This is a highly selected group of people that were retained in the life of the original study and that clearly must have indicated that they wanted to stay on the drug and planned to be adherent and less mobile,"" says Stefan Baral, a physician epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. So what the study may really be saying is that women who are well-informed about the drug, and who think they’ll benefit from it, are more likely to take it routinely. That may actually be good news, since a woman who requests PrEP from her doctor may share those characteristics. Unfortunately, the ""exorbitant costs"" associated with PrEP will prevent many women from accessing the drug, Arron says. If the drug — which is effective — costs less, that might make the HIV prevention strategy more prevalent in the developing world. Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that ""a total of 299 heterosexual individuals in Botswana were enrolled in the trial."" That number was wrong.

True, being a lesbian threw some complications into the mix, but her years of work with Sepal Reproductive International meant she was familiar with the world of assisted reproduction. However, Berman quickly discovered that her available options as a consumer left something to be desired. Physician-assisted intrauterine insemination (IUI) costs anywhere from $500 to $1500 per attempt, a rather steep price for a procedure with a success rate that maxes out at around 20 percent. At-home insemination is cheaper, but using a syringe or turkey baster to initiate conception wasn’t quite the intimate, romantic experience Berman wanted to begin a new life with. Using a syringe or turkey baster to initiate conception wasn't quite the romantic experience Berman wantedThe first artificial insemination was in London in the 1770s, when Scottish-born surgeon John Hunter advised a cloth merchant with severe hypospadias — a condition where the urethra is on the underside of the penis, rather than the tip — to collect semen spilled during intercourse in a warmed syringe and inject it into his wife’s vagina. The technique has since spawned an entire industry, one that’s enabled countless individuals to conceive. But as we’ve used technology to expand our reproductive options, we’ve lost intimacy in the process — and it’s that very intimacy that Berman sought to recreate when she invented the Semenette, a squirting dildo that mimics male ejaculation, allowing her to impregnate her wife the same way a heterosexual male would. Berman is not the first person to invent a sex toy capable of ejaculation — several companies, including sex toy giant Doc Johnson have explored the niche with various toys, creating toys that allow individuals or couples to experience ejaculation independent of a flesh-and-blood penis. But Berman is one of the few to create one with insemination specifically in mind — and that mission has provided the Semenette with a number of features that set it apart from competing products. Most squirting dildos were low-end toysPrior to the Semenette, most squirting dildos were low-end toys, made of cheap materials that weren’t always easy to clean. The Semenette is 100 percent medical grade silicone (meaning it can be easily sterilized), and unlike competitors, which permanently embed the dildo’s tubing into the product, the Semenette offers a removable, replaceable tube that can be discarded after each use. It was also designed with the wearer’s comfort in mind, with a chamber in the back that allows the tubing to tuck in and lay flat. Perhaps best of all for aspiring parents, with a retail price of $139.95 (and $45 for a pack of five replacement tubes), the Semenette is dramatically more cost effective than doctor-assisted IUI, especially for repeat users. Though users are still responsible for supplying their own semen, the Semenette provides everything else they need to create an intimate, loving conception experience in the privacy of their own home.  In the years since it first hit the market, the Semenette has made inroads with the lesbian couples Berman originally envisioned as its audience. But it’s also found its way to a number of other groups as well. Semenette fans include trans men, men dealing with erectile dysfunction or disabilities, and couples that include an HIV+ partner, to name a few. For many of these users, the Semenette’s appeal is as simple as it is revolutionary, offering them access to something so basic that many heterosexual couples take it for granted. As Berman explains the Semenette does little more than ""[recreate] what heterosexual couples are doing on a daily basis."" For trans men in particular, the Semenette holds promise beyond its reproductive capabilitiesBut assisted reproduction isn’t the only thing that draws people to the Semenette: for some users, the attraction is something else entirely. For trans men in particular, the Semenette holds promise beyond its reproductive capabilities, with a realistic, ejaculating dildo easing gender dysphoria for some users. Based on user feedback, Berman estimates that only about 50 percent of trans users are seeking to become parents — and the notion that the Semenette has potential to do more than just assist in reproduction has inspired her to explore other potential markets for the product. Berman sees a number of other non-reproductive applications for the Semenette. Couples into pegging or BDSM can make use of the product’s squirting abilities to engage in enhanced gender play. Solo users turned on by the sensation of ejaculation might find the Semenette’s squirting abilities intensify their pleasure during solo play. The Semenette was intended to revolutionize IUI, but in the process, Berman seems to have stumbled onto a product poised to carve out a whole new niche in the adult industry. In the meantime, Berman’s happy to focus on the Semenette’s existing success stories: Berman herself is a proud Semenette parent, with a 15-month-old child serving as a testament to the product’s ability to aid conception with a mix of fancy new technology and good old-fashioned intimacy.",0.6483588762058083,0.35164112379419166,0.8450096116728476,835,5.3029940119760477,442,6.4457013574660635,1,0,"Science, Report"

An enhanced-color image of Nix makes the moon look something like a pinkish jelly bean, while the image of Hydra shows a lopsided moon with various curves and dips. These moons stand in stark contrast to the mostly spherical moons that dominate our Solar System.  The photographs were both taken by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft on July 14th with the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), the probe's high-resolution imaging instrument. New Horizons snapped the image of Nix when it was 102,000 miles away from the moon and captured Hydra when it was 143,000 miles away. Despite their blurriness, the photos are a big step up from the first heavily pixelated images we got of Nix and Hydra. ""It's a surreal experience to see [Hydra] become an actual place."" ""Before last week, Hydra was just a faint point of light, so it's a surreal experience to see it become an actual place, as we see its shape and spot recognizable features on its surface for the first time,"" said NASA mission science collaborator Ted Stryk of Roane State Community College. NASA researchers estimate that Nix is 26 miles long and 22 miles wide. In reality the moon is mostly a gray color, but the exaggerated tint highlights a reddish region on Nix's surface. NASA thinks this area is probably a crater. Additional data already gathered by New Horizons will help NASA researchers further characterize this area, but that information has not been downlinked to Earth yet. The image of Hydra brings into focus its size and awkward shape, which NASA likens to the outline of Michigan (though I actually see another famous dog). The New Horizons team also spots at least two large craters on Hydra's surface, and the moon's shifts in darkness from top to bottom suggest that its surface is made of different materials. NASA estimates that Hydra is similar in size to Nix, measuring 34 miles long and 25 miles wide. We've only known about the existence of Nix and Hydra for a short time. The two moons were first discovered in 2005 in images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Pluto has five moons totals, which are believed to have chaotic orbits around the dwarf planet and its largest moon Charon. We'll get better images of Pluto's other two moons — Styx and Kerberos — sometime in October.

Its library’s special collections house everything from 1920s “dime novel” reviews to T-shirts that were auctioned off in protest of the 2002 Farscape cancellation. In 2012, though, it acquired one of the most valuable resources yet: the library of James “Rusty” Hevelin, a lifelong science fiction superfan and prolific collector of books and fanzines dating back to the 1930s. Last year, the Hevelin Collection was chosen as the first target of the university’s Fan Culture Preservation Project, a massive effort to digitize some of the most vulnerable and ephemeral pieces of science fiction history. Now, that effort is starting to take shape. In July, UI digital project librarian Laura Hampton officially began the long process of archiving the Hevelin Collection. The library is partnering with the fan-run Organization for Transformative Works to collect more zines for eventual digital archival, but Hampton is currently focused on material from the 1930s to 1950s, spanning the rise of zines and the Golden Age of science fiction. The vast majority of the images will stay offline, but an accompanying Tumblr has given outsiders a peek into the roughly 10,000 zines that Hevelin donated — and into the communities that helped create science fiction as we know it, from fandom clashes to fan fiction. It’s impossible to talk about the history of sci-fi, or modern popular fiction more generally, without talking about fandom. H.P. Lovecraft, Ray Bradbury, Robert Heinlein, and many other seminal authors were shaped by and participated in fandom, whether through letters, early science fiction conventions, or fanzines. Zines were home to some of these writers’ first stories; later in the 20th century, they were central to the rise of fan fiction. But for a variety of reasons, they were usually meant to circulate through a community, fade away, and fall apart. Fanzines feel almost designed to resist archival. ""Creators were working with what they had, often within pretty tight budgets, and producing fantastic images with relatively cheap materials,"" Hampton tells The Verge. Many of Hevelin’s zines were hectographed — copied by pressing paper to an inked gelatin pad. The medium produced brilliant purples and blues that can still be seen in some of the illustrations. But it favored cheap, highly acidic paper, and images could fade within hours under direct light. ""There are rusty staples, tape — all these material things that make a fanzine a fanzine are also what make them difficult to preserve."" Each zine is photographed page by page as quickly as possible, supported by a specially designed cradle, until it can go back in storage. ""All these things that make a fanzine a fanzine are also what make them difficult to preserve.""  A few hectographic images are showcased on Hampton’s Hevelin Collection Tumblr. They’re the epitome of bizarre 1930s pulp: a metal claw-handed giant bat (apparently) breathing fire on the Capitol Dome, a robed man being (again, apparently) attacked by an alien octopus while trying to inject something into the arm of a semi-nude woman. Other Tumblr posts are strikingly timeless, like illustrator Alva Rogers’ 1940s covers for Lovecraft tribute zine The Acolyte. And some photos highlight the writing of early fandom, including snippets of short stories and nonfiction columns. ""One of the things that surprised me most about the fanzines is their personal nature,"" says Hampton. ""While some editors primarily published fiction, so many of the fanzines are personal accounts of cons, events, reviews of other publications, reviews of pulps.  There is a dialogue that emerges, between publications and across years."" The 1930s was a foundational period in science fiction, and as communities tried to define what the genre stood for, that dialogue wasn’t always friendly. The first World’s Science Fiction Convention, held alongside the 1939 New York World’s Fair, was also the site of a feud between two fan groups: the Queens Science Fiction Society and the rival Futurians. According to later accounts, their struggle for control culminated in an aggressive leafleting campaign and the banning of several prominent Futurians from the convention, including future award-winning author Frederik Pohl. (They showed up anyways, hobnobbing with attendees — including a teenage Ray Bradbury — outside the official venue.) The fight is referenced in one Hevelin Collection photo, which captures a con-goer’s recollection of ""a number of nasty things."" Digitizing the Hevelin Collection is a long-term project, but it’s merely a part of the University of Iowa’s whole fandom archive. And the archive itself captures only pieces of fandom history. Zines still exist, but future archivists will face the challenge of collecting stories, videos, podcasts, and art spread across hundreds of fan sites and larger repositories. They’ll have to decide what to preserve and how to present it — the equivalent of fanzines’ personal conversations might now take place in a LiveJournal comment section, or the reviews of a story on FanFiction.net. Fandom itself has been dealing with these questions for years, and the Organization for Transformative Works runs its own fiction archive and fandom wiki. But libraries have to work with longer-term solutions in mind, ones that aren’t dependent on outside hosting services or current computing platforms. ""This is one of the central questions of the profession today, and answers are varied and ever-changing,"" says Hampton. Even with these limits, the Fan Culture Preservation Project is stopping a key part of fandom history from disappearing. But in doing so, it’s using the zines in a way that their creators may never have envisioned or intended, and the effort hasn’t sat well with everyone. As the project progresses to newer material, it will also shift into more sensitive territory. Where early zines might have published gossip and reviews, later ones circulated the first slash fiction — stories, often explicitly sexual, about romances between male characters. ""I don't want my fanzines included in any way,"" wrote one commenter on the Organization for Transformative Works’ announcement post. ""I keep in print those I want to keep available, and some have purposefully been taken out of print and allowed to quietly fade away. If I wanted them made public and accessible, I'd have done it."" Practical concerns exist: an erotic fanfic author might not want to risk being outed to family or friends, and an author who fears copyright crackdowns might worry that companies will see the archives as a form of public distribution. But there’s also more general discomfort with a niche hobby suddenly coming under academic or public scrutiny. ""There is a vast difference between publishing to a fairly known community and having your work suddenly available to a very different community in both outlook and number,"" another commenter wrote. ""Post-internet authors have an understanding that their work will be found now. Pre-internet authors did not."" Some of the complaints hinge on how accessible the zines will be. While the archives are being digitized, only small pieces like the Tumblr photos are being put online. A group of volunteers will transcribe the text and upload it into a searchable directory. If researchers want specific material, they can visit the library or request scans of limited portions, a standard archival practice. To some people, that’s enough; to others, it’s tantamount to letting someone photocopy and redistribute their zine. Hampton says that anyone who is uncomfortable with their work being digitized can contact the library, and they’ll try to work out a solution. But she also says that there hasn’t been much resistance to the project. She hopes that some creators might even want to make their zines publicly available, something the university is in a uniquely strong position to do. And for every hesitant author or editor, there was one enthusiastic about the project. ""Sure, I'm slightly embarrassed, in an amused way, by the zines I published up to 50 years ago,"" wrote a fan who said they’d seen at least one of their old zines in UI’s library. ""But I published them — typos, grammatical infelicities, naiveté, and all — for people who might enjoy them, and that still holds.""",0.793792666457379,0.206207333542621,0.655485998431223,1359,5.2965415746872697,713,6.6297335203366057,0,16,"Culture, Web, Report"

They may very well be, but an unlikely competitor is gaining a surprising amount of traction. Hydrogen fuel cells — which use compressed hydrogen as their fuel and release only water vapor as their emissions — have been in development for decades. But only recently have they become livable, with performance and range numbers good enough to replace an average driver's gasoline-powered car. Now BMW, which has been engaged in a hydrogen R&D partnership with Toyota for several years, has announced at an event in France that it will begin testing fuel cell vehicles on public roads starting later this month as it ramps up for a commercial vehicle ""some time after 2020,"" reports Automotive News, citing comments from BMW's Matthias Klietz.  One of BMW's hydrogen-powered prototypes is a highly modified i8. BMW's moves come at a time of rapid change for the nascent fuel cell business: Volkswagen Group's Audi recently announced that it was effectively ready for a commercial hydrogen vehicle, and Toyota is months away from launching the first ""mass market"" fuel cell car in the US, the Mirai. Honda, meanwhile, has released hydrogen vehicles in limited numbers before. The company, along with Nissan and Toyota, just announced a joint partnership to build out hydrogen infrastructure in Japan. When this many of the world's top-10 automakers are throwing weight behind hydrogen, it's impossible to ignore. And as a fuel source, it's every bit as ecologically friendly on the road as a battery electric like Tesla's Model S is. But hydrogen isn't without controversy: Elon Musk has famously called hydrogen fuel cells a ""bullshit"" technology, arguing that distribution challenges alone make it less efficient than pure electricity. Efficient large-scale hydrogen production can be a problem, too, which Toyota has tried to smooth over by noting that it can be produced quite literally from bullshit.  A hydrogen station in Japan. (Toyota) But even in the best case, Musk is right that hydrogen needs to be physically delivered to stations in a way that electrons do not. And right now, those stations don't even exist at any useful scale. As part of the Mirai's extremely slow roll-out — Toyota only expects to sell a few thousand by 2017 — the company has partnered with suppliers to build out small networks of hydrogen refueling stations in California and the US Northeast that will make regional travel possible, if not convenient. Cross-country trips, however, will be beyond the Mirai's reach for the foreseeable future; meanwhile, Tesla has over 450 Supercharger stations globally. Level 1 chargers are practically everywhere, and faster combo chargers will bring Supercharger-speed charging to EVs from a variety of brands. Customers are just following the money To speed adoption, Toyota has opened its hydrogen patents to competitors, with the logic that the only way infrastructure will get built is if a variety of major automakers are in the mix. But as long as fossil fuels are around and reasonably priced, it's possible that none of this will matter: evidence suggests that a majority of car buyers simply follow the money when the time comes to buy a car. In an interview with The Verge, Ford CEO Mark Fields agreed: ""In 2010 or '11 there were probably 10 or 12 electrified vehicles, either conventional or plug-in hybrids, and they made up about 2.5 percent of the total industry. Year to date, there are over 55 electrified vehicles in the industry, and year to date, through the first quarter [of 2015], they take up... 2.5 percent of the industry,"" he says. But once gasoline becomes scarce or expensive — which it inevitably will sooner or later — the advantage may simply go to whichever technology is more affordable and more accessible. With vehicles like the Tesla Model 3 and Chevrolet Bolt in the works, both of which are promising usable range and a sticker price $35,000 or below, EVs certainly appear to have the leg up on hydrogen. The Mirai will list for over $58,000 before rebates at launch, and will have access to precious few refilling points. Unlike an EV, you can't just plug it in when you get home. This explains why most automakers are hedging their bets across multiple technologies: BMW, for instance, sells electrics, hybrids, and diesels in addition to its efforts in hydrogen development. And Klietz doesn't pull any punches about hydrogen's prospects in his comments to Automotive News: ""By around 2025 to 2030, we expect fuel cell cars to have an established presence, but there are challenges that remain, like building the refueling infrastructure.""",0.7222277412262166,0.2777722587737834,0.42754723186268456,771,5.1076523994811929,441,6.1678004535147393,0,4,"Transportation, Report"

UberPop, which connects users with non-professional drivers, has come under increased scrutiny from French regulators and taxi unions, who say it gives the San Francisco-based company an unfair competitive advantage. A law passed late last year requires all chauffeurs to hold costly professional licenses and insurance, which UberPop drivers are not obligated to obtain. French authorities have repeatedly called for a ban on the service, but Uber has appealed it in French courts and at the European Union. Uber says suspension is in the interest of safety The service had been allowed to continue during the appeals, but the French government has moved to crack down on it in recent days, after taxi unions staged a nationwide strike in protest of the service last week. This week, two Uber France executives were taken into police custody and later charged with operating an illegal taxi service. They are slated to go on trial in September. In its blog post, Uber France said it was suspending the service not because of ongoing legal disputes, but because of increased hostility between UberPop chauffeurs and taxi drivers across France. On at least two recent occasions in Strasbourg, taxi drivers posing as Uber customers reportedly ordered rides to remote areas and attacked Uber drivers, as part of an ambush operation. Other drivers reported being attacked and intimidated during last week's protests.

The project was developed by the team behind the traffic and mapping app Waze, which Google bought in 2013 for more than $1 billion. According to a report from Israel's Haaretz, Waze will provide the mapping and traffic data, while actual rides will be hailed with a new app called RideWith. The service will connect passengers with nearby drivers headed to and from similar locations. However, unlike Uber, drivers will not be able to make a living from RideWith: they'll be limited to offering two rides a day, and will receive only a small payment from passengers based on distance traveled and a nominal car maintenance fee. Each journey can be paid for via the app with Google collecting 15 percent of the fee, reports Haaretz. A carpooling service, not a taxi replacement This focus on carpooling rather than a taxi replacement will presumably help Google and Waze avoid some of the regulatory problems that have plagued companies like Uber. Earlier this month, for example, Uber was forced to suspend its UberPop service in France (which uses non-professional drivers) after a nationwide strike from taxi drivers. Google's carpooling service is set to launch in three cities initially — Tel Aviv, Ra’anana, and Herzliya — with the company reportedly planning to expand the pilot to other parts of Israel if initial tests are a success. According to Reuters, the RideWith app will use data from Waze to learn the routes drivers take to work and then match them with passengers going in the same direction. A spokesperson for Waze told the news agency: ""We're conducting a small, private beta test in the greater Tel Aviv area for a carpool concept, but we have nothing further to announce at this time.""",0.3283626288689888,0.6716373711310112,0.886473545724308,328,4.9512195121951219,207,5.7681159420289854,0,0,"Google, Tech, Transportation, US & World"

Borschberg has now been aloft in the solar-powered plane for more than 80 hours without refueling or touching down, breaking the 76-hour record set by Steve Fossett in 2006 on board the Virgin Atlantic Global Flyer. And Borschberg isn't done yet — the pilot and co-founder of Solar Impulse has another 40 hours in the air before he's due to reach his destination in Hawaii. The solar-powered plane took off from Nagoya in Japan on the eighth stage of its 13-stage round-the-world trip earlier this week. The journey to Hawaii was previously set to begin in Nanjing, China, but bad weather conditions forced Borschberg to land in the Japanese city and postpone his record-breaking attempt. The entire circumnavigation of the globe was to be broken into 12 manageable stages, but with the unscheduled touchdown in Nagoya, is now set to be completed in 13 chunks.  After Hawaii, Borschberg will take a well-earned rest from the cockpit, allowing co-pilot Bertrand Piccard to fly the solar-powered craft on to Phoenix, Arizona. From there, the pilots will tag-team their way across the United States, cross the Atlantic into Europe, before finally touching down in Abu Dhabi, where their journey began.   The plane still has 40 hours to go before it lands in Hawaii In taking the longest leg of the flight so far, Borschberg volunteered to sit in an unpressurized, unheated cockpit for five days straight. ""The first 24 hours were very technical"", he said from his position high above the Pacific ocean, ""but the second day was really getting me into the mission. It took me a while to create a relationship of trust with the airplane, which allows me to rest and eventually sleep by periods of 20 minutes with the autopilot. The experience of flight is so intense that I can only focus on the present moment and discover how to deal with my own energy and mindset."" In addition to breaking the solo flight record, the 80-hour journey has already broken all distance and duration records for solar aviation, helping Solar Impulse's stated desire to spread the word about renewable energy sources. ""Can you imagine that a solar powered airplane without fuel can now fly longer than a jet plane!"", Piccard said in response to the record-breaking flight. ""This is a clear message that clean technologies can achieve impossible goals!""

It was a rather grand conclusion to an exceptional first season for Formula E, and the EV series looks destined for more. But I can’t stop thinking about the series’ first race. I stayed up until 4AM on a Saturday morning last September to watch the debut of Formula E from my couch. The brand new racing series was making its debut in Beijing, and an overnight broadcast wasn't going to deter me. I've loved racing since I was young, and I had to see what this crazy new series was like. And by the end of the race I had forgotten the close quarters of my New York City apartment and was in full throttle, screamy sports fan mode, because on the very last turn of the very last lap of the first race in the history of Formula E, something incredible happened.   The race, until that point, had just been pretty good. But the last few laps were intense. Nico Prost, who led from the start, had Nick Heidfeld breathing down his neck around every corner. Heidfeld had an ace up his sleeve: he saved just a little more battery power than Prost did throughout the race. Maybe it was because he wasn't in front pushing dirty air, maybe it was because he used the car's regenerative braking more effectively; either way, he had an edge. He used that extra power to push by Prost before the pair got to the final corner — a move he tried and failed at the lap before. Prost saw the attempt in his mirror, hesitated, and by the time he tried to block the attempt, Heidfeld was almost by him. He cut hard to the left, clipped Heidfeld's car, and sent him careening into the wall of the final turn. Neither man won the race.  Formula E isn't shy about posting highlights and large chunks of its races on YouTube and Facebook, a practice Formula One has been slow to adopt. I leapt to my feet during all of this, shouting loudly enough to wake the neighbors above and below me. But the most surprising part of this was my brother, nowhere near a sports fan, yelling alongside me. He had made it home from his shift at the local beer garden right before the race started and, for some reason, listened to me when I convinced him to join me in watching. ""This is history! They're completely electric! It'll be over quick, you can't go to bed!"" He shrugged, cracked a Budweiser, and obliged me. One hour later, he was right there with me, mouth agape at the fantastic racing happening on our screen. The duration is important, and it's one of the foremost reasons I believe the series is headed for healthy success: it has an opportunity to attract an entirely new demographic of fans who are short on time and attention. Formula E races last, at most, one hour. If I had tried to convince him to watch one of NASCAR's four-hour marathons or even a relatively trim two-hour Indy Car race, he would have just gone to bed. For that, I have a reason to thank — not curse — the limitations of battery technology. The 200-kilowatt batteries in each Formula E car can only last around 25-30 minutes, which necessitates shorter competitions. Even better, the brevity improves the experience at each track. Formula E doesn't demand an entire weekend's worth of travel, camping, and time spent baking in the sun on molten-hot bleachers. Hell, for some races they didn't even charge for admission. The FIA knew it needed to bring as many eyeballs to Formula E in its debut season, and it made some shockingly wise decisions on how to do that the right way. That's a shock because, in many respects, the FIA’s flagship series is a bit of a mess. Formula One is constantly involved in one controversy or another, whether it’s smaller teams literally begging for help because they can't afford to compete, or Red Bull, a main team sponsor for years, threatening to quit. The turmoil also comes at a time when rumors are flying that a group of investors is planning a takeover of the series.   The common complaints about Formula E from traditional race fans are immaterial, like the fact that the drivers have to switch cars in the middle of the race. That's just a temporary limitation of the battery tech — right now it's just too unsafe to try to quickly swap the car's battery. Besides, the two-car approach provided a lot of great drama this year. Drivers who may have banged up their first car kept pushing hard, knowing there would be a fresh one waiting in the paddock in just a few laps. Chances at redemption were built into each race at a core level. Then there’s Fan Boost, where the top three drivers in a pre-race fan vote win two short bursts of power during a race. It’s one of the first complaints from traditionalists about the new series, but in truth its impact was minimal in the first season. The street courses are so tight that drivers often didn’t have room to use them and, when they did, it often put too much stress on their entry into a corner or it gained them little ground. Perhaps the biggest thing standing in the way of Formula E is that the popularity of many major racing series is suffering. NASCAR's ratings are down, its attendance is in freefall, and while the races are still fun, the series can't stop itself from alienating fans every year by continuously changing all the rules. IndyCar is struggling to keep up with what popularity NASCAR does have, and its own attempts to stay relevant keep backfiring. Formula E making a great debut right now is a bit like showing up to a dinner party and discovering everyone already ate. When I covered the Formula E race in Miami, I asked the drivers if they thought the series would ever appeal to the hardcore American racing fan, the one complaining about the lack of engine noise and the absent smell of burning fuel. Scott Speed practically cut me off before I finished the question. ""No,"" he said. ""It’s a global series. This thing is different."" Team owner Michael Andretti agreed with him. ""We have to look at this as a different type of racing,"" Andretti said. ""You can’t come in with the same ideals."" Then, Lucas di Grassi echoed the case that series CEO Alejandro Agag has made since Formula E was born — that it's all about kids. ""When [the younger generation] thinks about buying their first car, they'll think about buying an electric car,"" he said.   Formula E also holds an electric kit car competition before its main races in an effort to get kids involved.  The argument is that if kids grow up with fewer fossil fuel-powered cars, it seems likely that they'd be turned off by the idea of a racing series that glorifies them. They'd gravitate toward a series like Formula E. By then the series won't be so experimental, and should be even better. And while the worldwide shift from gas to electric is changing at an immeasurably slow pace, the adoption of electric vehicles at least seems possible thanks to companies like Tesla. Richard Branson put this all more bluntly during the press conference in Miami. ""Unless you have sports like this, we’ll never get to a world that’s carbon-neutral by 2050,"" he said. ""I hope 10 years from now, 20 years from now, the smell of exhaust will be as much a thing of the past as the smell of cigarettes in a restaurant.""   Branson, predictably, hasn’t shut up about Formula E. At this weekend’s season finale, he told the media he believes Formula E will overtake Formula One's popularity in four years. This is where the real fun begins. Branson’s comments riled up many inside Formula One. The 2009 series champion Jenson Button fired back at Branson, saying, ""Formula E is a good addition to motorsports because that will be the electric series and the rest of us can get on with motor racing."" Infiniti Red Bull’s team principal Christian Horner said the Formula E cars ""look slow,"" and that they’re more of a competitor to one of F1’s feeder series’ like GP3. Whether you agree with them or not, Branson’s bravado got them both talking about Formula E. Having people like Branson and even Leonardo di Caprio involved is another reason to believe in Formula E, but more importantly the sport already has a lot of support from established automotive names. The Andrettis, the Prosts, the Renaults, and the McLarens of the racing world aren't going to waste their time with a series they don't believe in. The idea that Formula E is ahead of its time, that it's a series the people of tomorrow will love and embrace, if all of that really is the case, then it just has to hang around for a while. That seems completely possible. Formula E has money behind it, and putting a team together is nowhere near as expensive as it is in Formula One. The series held races in beautiful and diverse venues, running street courses in places like Sao Paulo and Russia. They even competed on hallowed racing ground with an event in Monaco. And mayors of other cities around the world are begging to host a race. More importantly, the competition in Formula E's debut season was excellent. The races were thrilling, and only three drivers won more than once. The first season's points championship even came down to the last lap of the last race, with Nelson Piquet Jr. beating Sebastian Buemi by one point. That competition has hooked some of these drivers, which might be the most important part of Formula E's near future. Just watch this interview with Buemi after the final race in London. He's dejected. He's pissed at Bruno Senna for blocking, because that one position cost him the trophy. Buemi is a WEC champion, has competed in Formula One, and run the 24 Hours of Le Mans, but he hates that he lost the first championship in this new series that might not amount to anything. Now watch the interview with Piquet. He's elated. He's speechless. Piquet has hopped from series to series his whole professional career, but he raced in all 11 Formula E races. He survived all except one — not an easy task, almost every regular driver had at least one DNF — and you can tell he's proud that it won him the title.   Formula E is young, but it already has the makings of a lasting series. The competition is great, and it has a killer rotation of young drivers who already care about winning a race. (Even Button agreed with that. ""The drivers are making that series,"" he told The Guardian.) It has a global interest. It has high-profile cheerleaders like Richard Branson. The battery technology that makes it all happen is only going to get better, and is already innately cool. Watching a Formula E race is awe-inspiring — even after 11 races I found myself wondering, ""How is this even possible?"" Formula E is also simple. The races are short, and the cars are evenly matched, which naturally breeds competition. That leaves less of a learning curve for new fans, and the sport doesn't require any major investments of time or money from those who are curious. Now it just needs its fans to keep watching, and maybe a few more brothers or sisters will join them on the couch. Correction: This post originally stated that an investment group is interested in buying FIA. The group is actually rumored to be buying Formula One.

Now, it’s turning its attention to a line of watches — just regular, plain-old watches — that it sells under the Minus-8 brand. (The name is a subtle reference to San Francisco’s time zone, Greenwich Mean Time minus eight hours.)  Minus-8’s line currently consists of four models, ranging in price from $198 for the simple Zone to $598 for the Layer 24, a full four-dial chronograph. They’re big, heavy, wholly unapologetic timepieces. It’s almost as if they’re sending a middle finger in the direction of the wearables industry that’s trying to kill them.   So why do they exist? Why now, in the shadow of Android Wear, the Apple Watch, and countless fitness bands? Part of it is old-fashioned indulgence on the part of Astro. ""From a pure design standpoint, it’s sort of like doing that classic chair, that piece of furniture, that eyewear, the bag, the shoes. I mean, there’s sort of a designer hit list that you kind of want to go through over the years. So watches sort of fell into that,"" says Brett Lovelady, Astro’s founder and CEO. ""We shared [Minus-8] with the design community and got a lot of traction and ended up in a bunch of publications and things, so we basically decided to manufacture a certain number of the products."" Still, it’s surprising. It’s not that Astro doesn’t have experience with wearables or smartwatches; the firm was behind the design of the Nike FuelBand, one of the first widely popular connected wearables. It just turns out that a dumbwatch (if you will) can still attract some attention, as long as it’s done correctly. While the concept started in an Astro conference room, Minus-8 is owned by PCH International, a company that handles the ins and outs of turning ideas into actual products. PCH’s bread and butter lies in Asian-manufactured electronics. These watches are decidedly not electronics, but the DNA comes through: they employ a ""layered"" manufacturing technique, for instance, which Lovelady tells me was inspired by the layer-by-layer construction in the electronics industry. For Minus-8, this means a stack of stainless steel slices on the cases of the Layer and Layer 24 models that are bound together; by changing the colors of individual slices, Astro has a lot of flexibility in tweaking the design. And like many modern gadgets, the Minus-8 watches are assembled in China. The cheaper models use Quartz movements; the larger, heavier, more expensive ones use self-winding mechanical ones, but they’re all Japanese — not Swiss, like you find in most higher-end timepieces. ""We felt like our customers would appreciate Japanese movements as well as, you know, Swiss or other movements. Especially at the price points that we’re talking about,"" Lovelady says. It’s an interesting line that Astro is walking, pairing the design sensibility of a nice watch with the manufacturing sensibility (and the price) of a typical gadget. While handcrafted ultra-luxury watches get away with charging tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars — unaffected by the sea changes in technology that are happening all around them — Minus-8 is made and priced no differently than the wearables it goes head-to-head against. Lovelady is still bullish about his prospects, because watches fill a role in the wardrobe that smartwatches and other wearables simply haven’t been able to. ""I think the reason you’ll still see traditional watches do really well is because they’re also still involved in traditional relationships of apparel and fashion and expression and all those things,"" he says. ""I don’t know how much of a watch junkie you might be, but a lot of people have multiples, just like they have different kinds of shoes and they want to wear that watch on that day."" He says that the Apple Watch, with its high level of customization and personalization, is taking some strides in that direction — but for now, the theory goes that the watch still has its place. That’s not to say the studio is spurning smartwatches altogether; Lovelady acknowledges that Minus-8 could eventually move in that direction. In fact, some of its current models have an NFC chip molded into the band that can trigger a programmed action on an Android phone (launching the camera app, for example). ""It’s more of an easter egg,"" Lovelady says. ""It’s a nod toward technology."" Otherwise, though, these are just good-looking timepieces that don’t cost a ton of money, trends be damned. ""We’re not worried about following anybody else."" ",0.5554412497711709,0.44455875022882907,0.20915562262817666,852,5.089201877934272,489,6.3006134969325149,0,12,"Design, Report"

Drawing is about the only thing he ever imagined doing; Rebelka's illustrations have been featured in comic books and video games, but he says his favorite piece is whatever he's working on at the moment. ""I am experiencing my illustrations only while creating them,"" he explains, ""after I forget about it."" Growing up in Poland, Rebelka drew inspiration from a huge range of sources, everyone from iconic French comic artist Moebius to Akira artist Katsuhiro Otomo to Polish painter Stanislaw Szukalski. But the big names weren't the most important influence on his career. ""My father is an amazing artist,"" says Rebelka, ""he taught me all."" This broad range of influences has led to a distinct look, one that jumps between different styles at ease; his work can feel like a classic painting by way of Japanese and French comic artists. Like many artists, he uses a combination of real world techniques — in his case, acrylic paints and water colors — in addition to digital tools like Photoshop. His late night illustration sessions are fueled primarily by music and audiobooks. ""I spend a lot of time behind the desk drawing,"" he says. Outside of comics, Rebelka's work has also been featured in several video games, which includes contributing to animated sequences featured in games like the fantasy RPG The Witcher 2 and strategy game Anomaly 2. But he doesn't have grand aspirations of building his own games or movies. Instead, it's the intimate relationship with a comic writer he prefers.

After getting his start working in 3D modeling for video games, Dart has since moved on to do illustration work for some of the biggest names in the industry. He's worked on movies like Disney's Big Hero 6, Paranorman, and next year's Pixar flick Inside Out, as well as animated series like Powerpuff Girls and Steven Universe. He even helped create an animated sequence for Neil Degrasse Tyson's TV series Cosmos. ""It was so awesome to be able to work on something so entertaining and powerful,"" says Dart. He also, alongside Mountain creator David OReilly, helped design the fictional video games for the movie Her, and he created a series of fantastic posters for Interstellar. When it comes to film work, Dart typically gets in very early in the process, playing with different ideas and helping define the look of a movie. With Big Hero 6, for example, he created a number of sketches showcasing different looks for villains and locations around the fictional city San Frantokyo. He also took multiple stabs at the movie's biggest star, the rotund robot Baymax. ""Occasionally the studios get in touch with me to do really early blue-sky development work and play around with ideas,"" he says. ""It's really fun being involved at the early stages of a film because there are no constraints or huge pressure to finish a $100 million film and you can really just explore and imagine stuff."" Whether it's a movie about inflatable robots or a cartoon about super-powered tween girls, Dart maintains a very specific style, one influenced by everything from 1960s advertising to classic spy flicks. That style is perhaps best exemplified by his own personal project, Yuki 7 and the Gadget Girls, about a team of Tokyo super spies. While he plans to continue Yuki's adventures and keep working in animation, Dart's experience with Cosmos also made him want to explore different kinds of projects in the future.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the Fashion Entertainments startup behind that crowdfunded watch is in fact a subdivision of Sony, tasked with designing and experimenting with products that can define the next evolution in personal electronic devices. The watch is extremely thin and makes no pretense of being smart, relying on the chameleonic flexibility of its appearance and a clean minimalist shape to win over fans. Because it has no sophisticated electronics inside, it's also said to last as long as 60 days on a single button battery. The FES watch is just one of a number of prototypes that Sony has developed while investigating the viability of e-paper as an unusual material for wearable devices. The company is also looking into making bow ties (see video below), hat and shoe accessories, and paper holders out of electronic paper.

After spending some time in advertising — ""working for clients was usually pretty horrible"" — Ferland lucked into a part-time gig mocking up game concepts for a new studio. This ignited an unknown passion for game design. ""As a kid, I had no idea game design was even a thing,"" he says. He has since moved on to Montreal-based Tribute Games, the studio behind cult hits like Mercenary Kings and Wizorb, where he's able to satisfy his love for both art and game design. Though you may not recognize his name, there's a good chance you've seen Ferland's work. He's contributed art to a number of indie games, including cult PlayStation hit Johann Sebastian Joust and the upcoming PS4 game Close Castles, the next release from the designer behind Threes. He's also created album covers for musicians like Disasterpeace, and promotional art for games like Super Time Force. Ferland has done quite a bit of work in the indie scene, and it's primarily thanks to one game — and not one of the many he's worked on. ""A really big part of that 'I can make games' epiphany was playing the original Spelunky,"" he says. The game, which started out as a freeware title but is now available on a number of consoles, exposed Ferland to the world of indie games, and he dove straight in by getting involved in game jams and local community events. Since then he's partnered with a number of designers, big and small, working on everything from card games to console releases. ""All because Derek Yu made a tiny platformer game called Spelunky and released it for free online,"" he explains. Now that he has a full-time job in games, Ferland doesn't have as much time to dabble in side projects, especially when it comes to making new games. He does have a personal project in the works, though, which he describes as a ""small book about tiny adventures, melancholy, helplessness, love, and other very broad subjects."" It features a tiny black bird-like creature, has very little in the way of dialogue, yet the early images he's released so far are wonderfully dark.

Some write fan fiction, while others get into cosplay. Dayton Allen, meanwhile, builds stunningly detailed sculptures of his favorite sci-fi movies. Until 2012, that work was reserved for recreating characters and scenes from Star Wars; he's built beautiful figures of everyone from Darth Vader to the Yuuzhan Vong aliens from the expanded universe. But more recently he decided to tackle his favorite film, one that never really had proper action figures of its own — the original Alien from 1979. ""Alien is an art film,"" he says of his fascination with the sci-fi horror classic. ""Its origins come from artists and designers that shaped what we consider modern science fiction today."" Unlike the first Star Wars, which had a wealth of action figures featuring virtually every character in the film, the first Alien never had a proper toy line of its own. Though one was planned back in 1979 and prototypes were built, Kenner ultimately cancelled the idea before the toys went to manufacturing. (Toy company Super7 released its own figures in 2013 based on the original prototypes.) For Allen, this made Alien an ideal project to tackle: not only was it his favorite sci-fi movie, but he'd also be helping to fill in a gap. ""One of things I most enjoy about the hobby is creating figures and environments which the current toy industry would never consider producing,"" he explains. It's still a work in progress, but Allen's Alien project is a wonderfully detailed and complex recreation of the film, at 1:18 scale. Built in his spare time — Allen is a graphic designer by day — so far he's managed to complete several characters, most of the terrifying xenomorph, and a good chunk of the interior of the Nostromo spaceship. ""Since I'm not on a payroll to complete the work on a deadline,"" he says of the project, ""I take my time and enjoy the ride."" The process starts with a lot of reference material — screencaps from the films, behind-the-scenes-photography, and other production-related imagery. Allen has even gone so far as to talk to some of the original production crew to suss out some of the finer details. After that, he gathers the right materials — he builds figures and sets out of everything from epoxies and clay to laser-cut MDF board — which is followed by the pain-staking process of modeling and sculpting the figures. ""This being a Ridley Scott film,"" explains Allen, ""nothing is without complexity."" Many of the figures still need to be painted, and the ship's interior is still missing a few areas. Allen hopes to complete all of the characters by next year, though the ship will likely take a bit longer. It doesn't help that he's already taken a few detours — he recently started another set based on the Alien: Isolation video game, and is working on a new model from Alien 3. ""The project simply doesn't end with the first film,"" he says. ""But it is the most important to me.""

(Photo courtesy of EPIC) Cook's comments appeared to be directed at companies including Google, Facebook, and Yahoo, which offer advertisers platform for targeting their users with increasing sophistication. Cook also made what sounded like an oblique reference to the new Google Photos, questioning whether Google would ultimately use it for ad targeting. (It currently does not, and Google says it has no plans to.) ""You might like these so-called free services, but we don't think they're worth having your email or your search history or now even your family photos data-mined and sold off for God knows what advertising purpose,"" Cook said. ""And we think someday, customers will see this for what it is."" ""Someday, customers will see this for what it is."" It's worth noting that Apple has an ad business of its own: iAds, which runs inside iOS apps and on iTunes Radio. The ads enable companies to target customers by cross-referencing their email addresses and phone numbers anonymously against other data obtained by marketers. (It is possible to opt out of iAds personalization.) But the pointed nature of Cook's comments indicate the way trust and privacy are becoming a battleground for major tech companies as they increasingly encroach on one another's terrain. Google decided to move its Photos product out of Google+ in part because it found people didn't want to store their pictures in a social network, where they might be actually shared. Meanwhile, Apple's reputation is still recovering from the theft of hundreds of nude photos that were stored in iCloud accounts. As tech companies increasingly compete for personal data, the one that customers trust most will have an important advantage. Cook also used the speech to reiterate his opposition to creating a ""back door"" for law enforcement that would enable authorities to bypass encryption on user date. ""If you put a key under the mat for the cops, a burglar can find it too,"" he said. Chip Pitts, a human rights attorney and chairman of EPIC's board, said last night's award to Cook marked the first time the organization had honored a business leader. ""Recognizing that privacy is related to human rights like identity and nondiscrimination — it was an act of personal courage and values-based leadership,"" Pitts told The Verge.",0.6418205131928311,0.35817948680716893,0.8494236746916699,555,5.0684684684684687,332,6.0512048192771086,1,2,"Apps, Business, Tech, Report"

Yet it announced yesterday that it would roll out free shipping to all its customers on items that weigh 8 ounces or less with no minimum order size. At a glance, it seems like yet another move by Amazon to tighten its death grip on the $304 billion online shopping industry at the expense of the bottom line, but that might not be the case soon: if the company can manage to make its Prime Air drone delivery program a reality, delivering lightweight goods could actually become a weirdly profitable part of the business. Granted, there are still many technological and regulatory hurdles Amazon will need to surmount before Prime Air takes flight, even taking into consideration the progress we’ve seen in the industry and from the FAA over the last year. But let’s set those obstacles aside for a second to consider an interesting hypothetical: in a world where the FAA trusts semi-autonomous drones to fly over populated cities, do the economics of drone delivery make any sense? An analysis from Tasha Keeney at investment firm Ark offers a compelling argument that drone delivery could provide a path to substantial profits. 86 percent of Amazon deliveries could be carried by drone Amazon is on track to generate roughly $60 billion in revenue across North America this year, and the average order size for two items is around $60, so Keeney make a rough estimate of 1 billion orders and 2 billion items shipped each year. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has said that 86 percent of Amazon deliveries are the under 5-pound weight limit a commercial drone could reasonably carry. Keeney cuts that number down considerably, estimating just a quarter of orders will be both under 5 pounds and within a 10-mile range of a drone base station. One human pilot managing a small fleet of drones That works out to roughly 400 million packages a year eligible to be delivered by drone, a number that is likely to grow before Prime Air drones take flight. How much would it cost to put this program together? Keeney guesses $50 million on infrastructure for the Prime Air program to retrofit existing fulfillment centers with additional space, equipment, and software. The drones themselves, based on what Amazon has shown, are cheap quadcopters, costing around $1,000 to $3,000. Let’s start with 30 deliveries per drone per day, assuming they can’t operate at night or in bad weather, and each delivery takes roughly half an hour. It would take a fleet of 30,000 to 40,000 drones to move all that merchandise. Give them two batteries each at $200 a pop for a grand total of $80 million in equipment. That’s $150 million in overall capital expenditures, not a prohibitive expense for Amazon, which has billions in free cash flow. The real savings of drones, of course, is that unlike delivery trucks, they can operate without a human pilot. Keeney works on the assumption that even if the drones are allowed to fly without a human piloting them, there will need to be experienced operators who are keeping an eye on things, or helping with critical moments like landing in your front yard while avoiding the neighbor’s very agitated dog. Let’s say 6,000 drone minders at $50,000 a year, for labor costs of $300 million each year. She adds another $50 million each year for charging costs and fleet maintenance, and $350 million a year to deliver 400 million parcels is roughly 88 cents per package, which Keeney conservatively rounds up to $1 to simplify the comparison. Keeney’s research shows that stacks up incredibly well when compared to the cost of traditional same day delivery for FedEx, USPS, Google Express, and Amazon. Based on these margins, Amazon would recoup its investment in Prime Air after one year and generate substantial profit thereafter. (No wonder Amazon is pursuing Prime Air so aggressively.)   Again, there are many assumptions here and a lot of conjecture, but the assumptions are reasonably conservative. Amazon wouldn’t offer any comment, and some drone industry experts were skeptical. ""The economics are based on 400 million packages,"" says Colin Snow. ""Logistics operations have to ramp to full volume over time, so you’d have to bend investment and ROI accordingly — which Ark didn’t do in this analysis."" But that’s mainly a criticism of how quickly Ark believes the program would pay for itself, not an attack on the broader picture of how profitable it could be. Why not charge a little extra And while Keeney is calculating the per order cost with a 15 percent discount to get a nice round number of $1 per order, it’s not hard to imagine rapid drone delivery as the kind of thing people would pay a surcharge for. The program they rolled out yesterday will acclimate consumers to getting small items delivered for free, but with a reported wait of four to eight days. If you could have that package of Advil or missing ingredient delivered to your front lawn or rooftop in under an hour, it might be worth more than the sticker price.",0.5787463423194958,0.42125365768050416,0.15998940435199485,889,4.8672665916760405,470,5.9063829787234043,0,2,"Business, Tech, Report"

The company has launched numerous grassroots campaigns asking for people to call local officials and sign petitions in areas where it's run into resistance. Perhaps we can view this as a similar form lobbying — just about letting Uber into our lives. It's unclear what spurred the ad, but not where it's going to end up.

He wanted to make a system that let people talk to computers casually, as if speaking to another human. That was not a new idea of course; 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey had a talkative computer as one of its main characters. But Mohajer believed such a thing was no longer science fiction and could become commonplace. The only problem? It might take 10 years to build it. This is what SoundHound was originally supposed to do Investors were enamored with the idea, but not Mohajer's timeline. They said, ""Ten years is a long time, can you show me something that will happen in three years?"" he recalls. With that, Midomi was born, a service that would let you hum the tune of a song to identify it. Two years later, in 2009, he launched SoundHound, which did the same thing for music overheard on the radio or in the background of a TV show. Now, nearly a decade after that pitch to investors, Mohajer's original vision is here in the form of Hound, a voice search app that can handle incredibly complex questions and spit out answers with uncanny speed. Right now, you have to ask those questions inside the Hound app, but the company hopes to get the technology everywhere — even your toaster. That may never happen, but the company's demonstration of Hound — which was fairly scripted in our case — is astonishing enough to make me believe it's a possibility. Mohajer started with a zinger. ""What is the population of capital of the country in which Space Needle is located?"" he asked briskly. It's an oddly worded question, but intentionally so, meant to show how well it can extract and process what's being said. Ask it on any other service (even Wolfram Alpha), and you'll get the digital equivalent of a head scratch. But here, a robotic voice instantly replied, ""The population of Washington, DC is 601,723."" There were two Washingtons there, and it got the right one. In another test, he asked, ""How many days are there between the day after tomorrow and three days before the second Thursday of November in 2022?"" The app nailed it again. Hound feels a lot like Google's Voice Search Hound the app functions and feels almost exactly like Google's Voice Search, but seems much faster at identifying words and delivering answers. In our demo, which contained several dozen scripted questions but also some impromptu ones, the words coming out of Mohajer's mouth popped up on screen nearly as fast as he was saying them, and Hound would pipe back with an answer faster than seemed possible.   Mohajer says the speed comes from SoundHound combining two technologies that are typically separated on competing services. Hound is doing both voice recognition and natural voice understanding in a single engine, whereas rival services break them up into separate steps, first transcribing your question, then extrapolating what you were asking about. That said, our test also took place over Wi-Fi, and in a perfectly quiet room, making it impossible to tell whether Hound maintains these speeds in the real world. This is a personal assistant without a personality Unlike Siri or Cortana, Hound doesn't have a personality. Instead, it's a sass-free robotic voice. One other area where it's different is the number of sources it's pulling from. From the outset, Hound will have about 50 domains, or services it's tying into through APIs; things like currency converters, news sites, flight status information, and navigation. Mohajer says the plan is to ramp that up into the millions. ""Siri launched with 10 domains, and three years later it's at about 22 new domains, so it takes a long time,"" he says. For example, with Hound's deal with Expedia, you can ask Hound to find you a hotel in Seattle that costs less than $200 a night, that has free Wi-Fi, parking, and a continental breakfast. It's the same information you could get on Expedia's site, of course, but here, there's no need to click on a bunch of filters. There are other simple tools it's linked up to as well, things like a mortgage calculator (from a real estate site Mohajer would not disclose) and a speech-based game of Blackjack where you can place bets with your voice. For everything that doesn't get picked and assigned to one of Hound's sources, the app defaults to Microsoft's Bing. That means web results, including videos and images, are all shown in an integrated browser. Sometimes that's just fine, but in similar tools like Siri and Cortana, web results are a sign the system couldn't keep up with what you're asking of it. Mohajer contends that by kicking people to web results, nobody ends up feeling disappointed, though I'd argue that if it happens enough you'll just stop using the app entirely and forget about it. I wasn't quite able to push the boundaries of Hound beyond our demo, something users will get a chance to do once the service launches today. This has been designed to replace Google, but it can't just yet That brings up one of the weaknesses of Hound in its current form: it's not available as a replacement to other voice assistants. Developers will be able to integrate it into their own apps and hardware creations through a development platform called Houndify, something Mohajer believes will be widely adopted. ""Our vision is that everything can be enabled to have this interface, from millions of phones to billions of other types of devices like consumer electronics and cars,"" Mohajer says. ""We can't be the company to build this for every company — we need to enable them to do this for themselves."" But until that happens, most will know Hound for its app, which will be available only as an invitation-only beta on Android to start, followed by iOS where it will exist as a stand-alone app. That's a lot like how Siri was a third-party app before Apple bought it, and how Google still is on iOS. It also means that you need to have a very specific reason to use Hound over those built-in options on both platforms. You still have to go out of your way to use this It's worth noting that Hound is arriving at a time when Google and Apple are stepping up efforts to add context to the things people are looking at on their phones, often using voice interfaces, which could almost entirely remove the usefulness of Hound for simple searches. Last week, Google unveiled Now on Tap as part of its upcoming Android M release, a feature that brings its Now service inside of every app and gives the company an incredible amount of context for why you're looking for something. It hopes it will be good enough that you never even need to leave an app to pull up something you might search for. Apple is also rumored to be working on a feature called Proactive that attempts to put relevant apps and information in front of users without them having to search for it in the first place. That hurdle of having to find and launch Hound could change if app developers build the voice search into their apps, or if SoundHound and its technology get snapped up by one of these larger players. In the meantime, Mohajer believes that Hound's performance and experience will be enough for people to go that extra step of launching it before they ask, what they've been doing with the company's audio recognition apps for years. ""Just because it's easier to get to something is not enough for me to choose it. I don't use Siri for food, I use Yelp, even though Siri uses Yelp data, because they have a better experience. I use Google Maps on iOS instead of Apple Maps, even though Apple Maps is more integrated,"" he says.

Facebook then ""clarified"" its policies after initially cracking down on hundreds of drag queens who were using Facebook under their real names. The company said users are required only to use their ""authentic names,"" meaning the name by which they are known to most people. It added new ways for users to verify their name, including a library card, that might not require a legal name change. ""We've reached our breaking point."" In a post today on the site, Facebook executives defended the policy as the cornerstone of a friendly, authentic community. ""When people use their authentic names on Facebook they are more accountable for what they say,"" they wrote. ""People can be assured that they're really connecting with their loved ones, and no-one can hide behind an anonymous name to bully, taunt or say insensitive or inappropriate things."" Here's what we think of your flawed policy. #mynameis #nobullies #facebook @cyanidecyn thank you everyone who showed up today. Our voices were strong. A photo posted by Dots (@dottielux) on Jun 1, 2015 at 1:05pm PDT  At this point, the protesters and Facebook are talking past each other. The changes Facebook made likely have helped some users continue using the service under authentic-but-not-strictly-legal names. But the reporting tools may be making it too easy for trolls to go after performers and protesters. Unfortunately, Ello's involvement here risks making the entire event looking more like a publicity stunt.

It was just after 3PM on a Tuesday afternoon in mid-May — right after I’d attended his B-Sides concert in New York, and about a week into researching his Tidal music service. A few minutes before Jay called, I got a call from someone at Roc Nation telling me he wanted to have a chat. And I… tried to reschedule. I told Jay Z’s people I couldn’t talk right now. And then hung up. What Jay Z didn’t know is that I was running late for a haircut. I had just come off a flight, and my hair was looking rough. It was time to make a life decision: talk to Jay Z — rap legend, musical icon, one half of the closest thing we have to an American Royal Family  — and look busted, or get a fresh cut and risk passing up a conversation with Shawn Carter himself. You don’t know how fast you can find a contact in your phone until it really matters. I called Roc Nation back, asked them to ignore my initial display of insanity, and eventually found myself discussing Tidal with Jay Z. Jay Z sounds just like you would expect Jay Z to sound: relaxed, confident, and contemplative — his words don’t feel calculated, but they’re also not off the cuff. Then there’s his laugh — that infamous, full-throated laugh. When we touch on a topic he’s passionate about, like Tidal, he comes to life, expounding on the subject. Jay wouldn’t go on the record when we spoke, insisting that my story was about Tidal, not about him. And in a sense he’s right. This story is about Tidal: its rocky launch and its perhaps quixotic attempt at charting a new path in an industry undergoing massive change. But it’s also about Jay Z, one of music’s most entrepreneurial spirits, trying to resolve the inherent tension between technology and music. Tidal’s next attempt begins again today: Lil Wayne has signed onto the service and is releasing an exclusive new single called ""Glory."" Tomorrow, new desktop apps for Mac and Windows will arrive, along with a ticketing feature backed by TicketMaster that gives subscribers early and exclusive access to concert and music festival tickets. And there’s new pricing for college students starting next week: $4.99 for standard and $9.99 for the lossless Hi-Fi service. There’s no guarantee that anyone can run with Apple or YouTube, but after talking to a host of Tidal executives and employees, it’s clear Tidal plans to be as aggressive as possible as the next generation of music unfolds. Vania Schlogel has been on a nonstop press tour for weeks. The senior executive of Tidal is eager to reshape the narrative around the company after its tumultuous launch. She admits Tidal’s rollout did not go as planned, and in interview after interview, she sells the streaming service as an alternative to established companies like Spotify and iTunes. If Jay Z pulled off a coup by getting 16 artists to sit down and agree to work together, his second biggest accomplishment around Tidal was getting Schlogel to be the company’s public face. A former principal with the private equity firm KKR and an investment banker with Goldman Sachs, Schlogel was a member the exploratory group Jay Z assembled last summer and has been leading the charge ever since. If Tidal has gained any ground in the last few weeks, it’s largely due to Schlogel schlepping across TV, print, and digital publications reiterating what Tidal should have said during its launch. Since Jay Z purchased Tidal back in March, the dominant narrative has been one of hubris. The company launched with a widely panned video featuring Jay Z saying Tidal would ""change the course of history,"" while putting down ""tech companies."" ""It’s about putting humanity back into a being an artist,"" Madonna followed up. ""Not technology. Art."" ""I talked to a lot of people outside of the industry, and everyone was like, ‘What took so long?’"" says Jay Z, punctuating the question with his hands. ""Like this thing was the thing everyone wanted, and everyone feared. If these artists can sit in a room together, the game changes forever."" Six weeks later, the game has not been changed forever. And Tidal’s messy first impression — made worse by an even more bombastic press conference — continues to haunt the company. Forbes called Tidal a money grab by a collection of already rich artists; The New Republic argued that it was a sort of wealthy ""worker cooperative,"" doomed to fail in part because, unlike other streaming services, it doesn’t offer a free music tier. Flavorwire pointed out that Tidal’s exclusives — like the music video for ""Feeling Myself"" featuring Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé — were quickly hitting YouTube and making subscriptions unnecessary. Just last week, Bloomberg called the service ""a complete disaster,"" and speculated that Sony Music could deal the service the ultimate blow by pulling Beyoncé’s catalog. (Sony has since denied the rumor.) ""For me personally I had this moment where I was a little down,"" says Schlogel. ""It wasn’t about people saying negative things, it was around the misperception that was frustrating."" Meanwhile, a new threat is fast approaching: Apple appears to be ready to launch a new streaming service of its own next week. From a distance, Apple and Tidal appear to be making similar moves: Apple acquired Beats (co-founded by fellow rapper Dr. Dre) last year, and multiple sources indicate Beats’ other co-founder Jimmy Iovine is lining up exclusive artist deals and eschewing free all-you-can-eat services in favor of paid subscriptions. The difference is that Apple already reinvented the music industry once and is the world’s most valuable company, with over $100 billion in the bank and the runaway success of the iPhone to fall back on. Tidal is, well, Tidal. And even if Tidal can hold serve against Apple, surveys say teenagers mostly listen to music for free on YouTube. This is definitely not going to be easy. Tidal’s official headquarters and 100-person tech team are in Oslo, Norway, but the US operation is based out of the Times Square offices where Jay Z’s massively successful label / management / sports agency conglomerate Roc Nation makes its home. The tranquil, glass-encased setting boasts some of the best views in the city. Priceless Basquiat paintings line the walls. Tidal's share of the office is rapidly growing, expanding into the rest of the lofty space. Stepping out of the elevator, you wouldn’t know you’ve walked into a company most of the tech press has written off as doomed. Employees are upbeat, either impervious or oblivious to the public backlash against their employer. Over several weeks, I saw a steady stream of new Tidal employees every time I stopped by to visit: changing the game apparently requires quite a few people. Tidal as it currently exists began last summer, when Jay Z and his team sat down to assess the state of the music industry. ""Naturally we saw that it’s trending toward streaming, away from ownership,"" says Schlogel. ""That’s where we need to go, too, and that’s what we need to shape the future of."" But streaming had issues: Spotify, the dominant streaming service, was under constant fire for paying artists slim returns on licensing rights, with blame constantly shifting to and from the labels. Jay Z, whose success in business is on par with his success in music, recognized an opportunity to establish a different sort of streaming service that paid artists fairly. (""Fairly,"" of course, means ""more."") At first the group considered building an entirely new streaming service, says Schlogel, but time constraints came up. ""If we did this pure DIY, our time to be able to actually step in and reach the subscriber was at least 12 months or something like that. So we felt like stepping into a company that was already running was the next step."" So they went shopping. In November, the team found Tidal, a streaming service launched by the Norwegian company Aspiro. Tidal was essentially a rebranded version of WiMP, a streaming service that’s been available in Europe since 2010. For $20 a month, Tidal offered CD-quality streaming, far surpassing the average quality of MP3 downloads and Spotify streaming. It had been well-received by the niche audiophile market, but for most mainstream consumers, it was easy to write off as just another streaming service chasing Spotify’s throne. There was a nice bonus of 75,000 music videos, but unless you were obsessed with premium audio quality, there was little reason to sign up for it. It was an unassuming product, but for Jay Z’s group, it was the perfect opportunity. WiMP had been successfully operating in Europe for years, had the infrastructure to handle growth, and didn’t need a redesign. ""We were stepping into a relatively feature complete, mature product,"" says Schlogel. ""They had a great team there, really good tech guys… almost immediately we knew."" But good tech for tech’s sake isn’t really what Tidal cares about — part of the reason the company has struggled talking to the product-obsessed tech press. Like many in the media industry, Jay Z is frustrated by the enormous profits tech companies make against media consumption. ""I feel like YouTube is the biggest culprit,"" he rapped during his B-Sides performance. ""You bought nine iPhones and Steve Jobs is rich, Spotify’s $9 billion, they ain’t say shit."" Tidal, by contrast, is supposed to be a streaming service for artists, by artists. In the early 2000s, music companies wanted a cut of every iPod sold; now the artists want a piece of every song streamed. The battle lines might be new, but the conflicts are familiar, and the players are learning to find their leverage. ""We knew that just one artist alone can’t change an entire industry, or create a sustainable music economy,"" says Schlogel. ""We knew before we went for Tidal that it was going to have to be a group of people."" Using Jay Z’s connections, Tidal pulled in some of today’s top-earning artists, including Beyoncé, Kanye West, Madonna, Jack White, Jason Aldean, Nicki Minaj, Daft Punk, Alicia Keys, J. Cole, Rihanna, Usher, Arcade Fire, Chris Martin of Coldplay, Calvin Harris, and deadmau5. Each of them has taken an equal ownership stake in Tidal, rumored to have cost over a million dollars apiece. ""The artists are equal owners,"" Schlogel says. ""Jay’s provided funding to the company as basically a below-market interest rate loan."" Other artists declined to buy in: music industry sources say Apple’s Jimmy Iovine has tried to hire artists away from Tidal, including Jay Z himself. (Jay Z rapped ""Jimmy Iovine offered a safety net,"" at his B-Sides show.) Drake reportedly turned Tidal down at the last minute in favor of Apple, and Taylor Swift appears set to go with Iovine as well. In late January, Project Panther Bidco, a company owned by Jay Z, purchased Tidal for $56 million. Jay Z wouldn’t fully take control of the company until April 15th, but during the intervening four months, two events took place that created — and perhaps cemented — Tidal’s out-of-touch image. A week after the acquisition, Tidal’s 16 celebrity owners assembled for the first time at the Fig House in Los Angeles. Jay Z, Beyoncé, Madonna, Kanye West, Chris Martin, and others were there in person. Daft Punk showed up in full helmet. Alicia Keys, Usher, and Win Butler and Regine Chassagne of Arcade Fire attended via Skype feeds projected onto a huge screen. Champagne glasses clinked. The video cameras were rolling, ultimately creating the widely criticized video that made the summit seem like a room full of rich musicians congratulating themselves on changing the industry for their own benefit with few specifics to back up their claims. But Schlogel insists there was substantive discussion at the Fig House summit. ""I think at that point everybody felt like they didn’t want people getting between them and their fans,"" says Schlogel. ""And they worried about emerging artists and emerging songwriters."" This is the inaccuracy that clearly bothers her the most. ""If it’s all about wealth, you don’t care about the sustainability of something, you care about short-term gain. It’s completely the opposite of that."" ""You can’t make it to what we’ve accomplished without having that love of music be the foundation,"" Jay Z told the room. ""I think it’s one of the things that sets us apart from a tech company selling advertising or selling hardware. Right now they’re writing the story for us, we need to write the story for ourselves."" The group agreed to build an artist-controlled platform that could deliver a viable income stream for both new and established musicians. Tidal would pay royalties as much as four times higher than Spotify’s. And it would offer exclusive features and concert series to attract listeners. ""[The meeting] was about focusing on sustainability, which by definition is investing in emerging artists, and empowering artists to be closer with their fans,"" Schlogel says. ""At that time everybody was really into the mission statement of that, but it’s a business. We went into all the strategies around investing in emerging artists, giving artists greater creative control so that their fans actually see what the artist wants them to see rather than what a corporation wants them to see,"" Schlogel says energetically. ""How do we create a place where it’s commercially viable for artists to release something that might not hit a Top 40 outlet, or might not get corporate sponsorship, but it doesn’t matter because it’s creative and fans love it anyway? How do we create a commercially viable ecosystem around that?"" The iTunes Store wasn't built in a day. It took Spotify 9 years to be successful… We are here for the long haul. Please give us a chance to grow & get better. #TidalFacts There are many big companies that are spending millions on a smear campaign. We are not anti-anyone, we are pro-artist & fan. #TidalFacts When news of the gathering at the Fig House began to leak out, Tidal hastily scheduled a launch event for March 30th. The plan was to introduce the owners and lay out a vision, without revealing too many details. It turned out to be, broadly speaking, a train wreck. The Fig House video, which ran before the press conference started, felt glossy, bombastic, and purely promotional. Then Tidal’s celebrity owners came on stage to sign a mission statement and hype the moment — and hype they did. Alicia Keys said they would ""change the course of music history"" and dropped a Nietzsche quote. (""Without music, life would be a mistake."") Madonna threw her leg on the table while signing the declaration. Usher, the final signer, put down a thumbprint as a flourish. After they’d all signed, music’s hottest stars stood together on stage, laughing and talking, and seemingly not quite knowing what to do next. It was the quintessential launch event for an artist signing a new deal, or perhaps a Marvel movie. But in the tech world, it was seen as an out-of-touch group of musicians making sweeping promises about a new service while offering little to no detail; the self-important video and event were roundly mocked. Within days, Tidal was being called a flop across the internet. Artists like Death Cab for Cutie frontman Ben Gibbard, Mumford & Sons, and the perpetually upset Noel Gallagher criticized the company. ""I think they totally blew it by bringing out a bunch of millionaires and billionaires and propping them up onstage and then having them all complain about not being paid,"" Gibbard told The Daily Beast. ""This thing is going to fail miserably."" Schlogel admits that the launch — internally referred to as ""the 30th"" — could have been handled better. When I asked her if she would do it again the same way, she just says ""no."" ""I just did not anticipate that within 48 hours people would jump in so quickly and tell this story for us as if it’s gospel. That was so fast."" The plan had been to launch with the mission statement and then launch each new feature individually with some fanfare, but Tidal hadn’t counted on the speed of internet judgement. ""We weren’t even given a month of our own actions to tell the story,"" Schlogel says, somewhat pensively. ""Had we known at the time — had I known at the time — yeah, we would have filled that void more with our own words and then backed it up with actions. But at the time, we just thought, okay we’re going to back it up with action and that would be enough."" Launch disaster aside, Tidal pushed forward, introducing a trio of features over the course of April. Tidal X, a concert series and live-streaming platform that showcases established artists to subscribers, was announced on April 10th. Jack White, J. Cole, and Jay Z have all held concerts under the Tidal X banner, the last of which was viewed over 100,000 times during the live stream. Not huge numbers, but Tidal insists it’s beating expectations. But it’s Tidal Discovery and Rising that hint most directly at the company’s ultimate ambitions. Discovery lets unsigned artists upload music to the service and pick a preferred royalty structure without giving up rights to their music. Unsigned artists currently have ways to get onto Spotify and iTunes, but Tidal is making a point of promoting these artists, including a planned series of concerts around the US featuring the top streaming Discovery musicians. ""We’ve already had hundreds of artists upload through Tidal Discovery,"" says Schlogel. Tidal is more selective about which artists get added to the Rising program. Sveinung Rindal, who heads Tidal’s 15-person editorial team, says his crew ""looks for artists that can grow a bigger audience and be players in the music game for years to come."" Rindal’s team also runs Tidal’s digital magazine and playlist curation for the service. The plan is for artists included in Rising to get free PR and marketing support from Tidal, spending what Schlogel calls ""real dollars."" In some cases, they’ll be invited to perform live shows and be featured in behind-the-scenes videos and mini-documentaries. Lili K, a neo-soul singer based in Chicago, was one of the first artists to be featured in Tidal Rising. ""I honestly wasn’t quite sure what to expect,"" Lili K told me. Tidal filmed a mini-documentary starring the singer in Chicago and featured her content on its homepage, and Lili K’s music has now been streamed over 70,000 times on Tidal since being included in Rising. In contrast, Lili K’s YouTube page has only generated 36,000 views since 2010. ""I do know that because Tidal has supported me so much I think it has gotten me the most traction,"" she says. ""With Spotify and iTunes — I’m not saying they’re bad platforms or anything — but there is so much content, and a lot of times when you’re a smaller artist like me, you can kind of get buried underneath the bigger things. But with Tidal what’s really cool is my content is up there on the front page with the big superstars."" If this is beginning to sound suspiciously like Tidal is using the promotional power of its streaming service to act like a label, well, you’re not wrong. In effect, Jay Z, the former Def Jam CEO, is creating a talent pipeline, full of new artists to break. Between Discovery, Rising, and Tidal X, Tidal comes to resemble a full-fledged artist factory. ""Yeah it’s kind of the dream,"" Rindal says. ""It makes sense. You have to look into the future to see if it goes that way. For us [on] the editorial team, it’s all about covering all the different stages of a music career, from entering the stage [to] ending up as an established artist with a great audience."" This is where Tidal breaks with Apple and other music services most explicitly: while observers have predicted for years that Apple would leap into the music business by starting its own label, the company seems content holding the yearly iTunes Festival and collecting the fat margins that come from owning the dominant music service. Apple is famous for vertically integrating its products from chips to design to software; Tidal seems eager to vertically integrate artist discovery, distribution, and promotion. It’s hard not to note that Jay’s Roc Nation label nicely rounds out the stack, although Tidal is quick to note that Roc Nation has no special claim on Tidal artists. (And the major labels own stakes in Spotify.) Since the new ownership group acquired Tidal, subscribers have nearly doubled, jumping from 500,000 to 900,000 in just two months. That includes over 200,000 Hi-Fi subscribers, up from 12,000 at the end of 2014, according to the company’s public filings. Those numbers are tiny in comparison to other streaming services, but the company says they surpassed internal expectations. Spotify, which launched in 2008, didn’t reach 1 million subscribers until 2011 — though of course, that was a different time. But Tidal’s small subscriber base is apparently engaged with the service: Nicki Minaj’s ""Feeling Myself"" music video featuring Beyoncé hit 500,000 views in 10 days. That’s nothing on a service like YouTube, which has 1 billion users, but the company sees it as proof that subscribers are tuning in. The challenge now is to grow its user base in a streaming market that’s about to get extremely crowded by Apple. Tidal is releasing several new products and features now, a week before Apple’s supposed music service launch. Tidal has new desktop apps for Mac and Windows, reduced student pricing, new live-streaming features, and improved search and social features that let you know when an artist is live on the service, and listen to what they’re listening to. ""Our core identity is all about the connection between the artist and fan,"" Tidal CTO Rune Lending says. ""We are working hard to translate that into our social components going forward."" Tidal might have been borne of the tensions between artists and tech companies, but standing still on technology isn’t going to work when you’re up against the iTunes juggernaut. ""We’re increasing our tech department to make sure we’re able to push [out] all the kinds of things we want to do,"" Lending says. ""We already have a good pace of rolling out new updates quickly, and with an even larger team I think we can get even better at doing that."" But Tidal’s play isn’t just in adding tech features to reach parity with Spotify, Rdio, and Apple. The company is banking on its ticketing service and Tidal X concert series to separate it from the pack. The ticketing program gives subscribers early access to concert and music festival tickets, as well as exclusive access to Tidal X tickets directly on an artist’s page within the app. Live Nation — the massive concert promoter that puts on tours for a number of Tidal’s owners — worked with the company to integrate Ticketmaster into the app to power the back end of the ticketing service, and Tidal will receive a portion of the ticket fee revenues. ""There’s obviously part of the business that overlaps with Beats or Spotify, but we don’t consider ourselves just a music streaming company,"" says Schlogel. ""There’s going to be early access to tickets, to events that usually sell out very quickly, and exclusive merchandise."" Tidal also plans to continue adding independent movies like Daft Punk’s Electroma to the service. ""We also want to be a creative hub where indie filmmakers can release their films,"" says Schlogel. ""We’ll be putting more movies on there. It’s going to be more like an entertainment and cultural hub."" No one believes in Tidal. Okay, there are some fans, and stans, and audiophiles who use the service. But everyone else either hates it or hasn’t thought about it again since seeing that commercial. A month ago I didn’t believe it had a future either. But there are too many superstars backing it to write it off immediately. There are too many ways that Tidal can and likely will stay in the public eye: Jay Z or Kanye or Madonna will drop an album you can only get on the service; they might only sell tour tickets through the service; the only way for you to buy the next Yeezys may be through Tidal. These artists move product, and the product they want to move right now is Tidal. Tidal’s even managing to convince artists who were initially skeptical. ""The whole thing got blown out of proportion and taken out of context,"" Marcus Mumford of Mumford & Sons told The Philadelphia Inquirer about the band’s initial criticism of Tidal. ""I ended up having a conversation with Jay Z about it. He was gracious enough to give me a ring. And I get it much better now. He’s trying to create a sort of farmers’ market for music. It’s sort of an old-school record store. Which I like, now that I understand the vision."" I got a similar call, and I can confirm that Jay Z is a passionate and talented pitchman for his new service. Maybe he should just call everyone. But chances are, Tidal’s most powerful salesman won’t be calling you to personally expound on the merits of his company. And that’s Tidal’s biggest obstacle: changing perception. There’s the real chance that the public has moved on from Tidal and there’s just no going back. It’s possible that no matter what features they release and stops they pull out, the damage has been done. It’s also entirely possible that Apple’s service will dominate streaming music just like it did with downloads and iTunes. But when you speak with Tidal’s team, you don’t sense fear of what’s coming around the corner. They are still determined and confident that they can — for lack of a better phrase — turn the ship around. ""I’ll never forget I had this moment where someone had gone to the J. Cole Tidal X concert and tweeted, ‘thank you Tidal, this was the best night of my life,’ or something,"" says Schlogel. ""And I had this moment where — it’s silly, it’s not like corporations sit in a board room and look at one super happy fan and say, 'Yes our business is working' — but for me in that moment, I saw that person’s tweet and was like, we just gave this woman an incredible experience."" ""I’ve heard it from the mouths of the artists themselves: if they can give subscribers something like that, it means something."" Tidal office photography by Jo Straube.

The letter notes that although it's possible that the use of autonomous weapons could reduce human casualties on the battlefield, this itself could be a mistake as it would ""[lower] the threshold"" for going to war. ""Autonomous weapons are ideal for assassinations [and] destabilizing nations."" ""Unlike nuclear weapons, [autonomous weapons] require no costly or hard-to-obtain raw materials, so they will become ubiquitous and cheap for all significant military powers to mass-produce,"" states the letter. ""It will only be a matter of time until they appear on the black market and in the hands of terrorists, dictators wishing to better control their populace, warlords wishing to perpetrate ethnic cleansing, etc. Autonomous weapons are ideal for tasks such as assassinations, destabilizing nations, subduing populations and selectively killing a particular ethnic group."" A backlash against AI weapons could hamper research The letter ends by warning that the development of autonomous weapons could tarnish the field of artificial intelligence and create a ""major public backlash"" that would impede potentially beneficial AI research. The authors conclude that this ""should be prevented by a ban on offensive autonomous weapons beyond meaningful human control"" and are urging the UN to take action. The FLI is not the only organization campaigning in this area, but semi-autonomous weapon systems are already proliferating, with the US Air Force predicting that ""by 2030 machine capabilities will have increased to the point that humans will have become the weakest component in a wide array of systems."" Critics and proponents alike have also noted that it can be difficult to draw the line when it comes to what is and what isn't an autonomous weapons system. Other signatories to FLI's open letter include Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Skype co-founder Jaan Talinn, and Demis Hassabis, the CEO of DeepMind, a British artificial intelligence company acquired by Google last year. The FLI has previously published open letters on similar topics, including one in January this year calling on researchers to focus on the ""societal benefits"" of AI.

While the USA Freedom Act bans what's known as ""bulk collection"" of phone metadata, the NSA was given a six-month grace period to phase out the old program. When that period expires on November 29th, it will still have a large collection of old records (it was allowed to keep up to five years' worth) that are unrelated to any national security threat.

Typically, Nintendo hardware and software exist in harmony; the N64’s three-pronged controller made sense when you played Super Mario 64, and tens of millions of people understood the motion-sensing Wii remote the moment they pretended to swing a tennis racket. But, despite a number of wonderful games, the Wii U still doesn’t have a similar, system-defining experience. As much as I love Splatoon, I would be just as happy playing it with a Gamecube controller.  That problem has been solved at last. Nintendo is set to release Super Mario Maker, the first game for the Wii U that feels like it couldn’t exist on another console. It’s a fantastic experience for fans of classic Mario adventures, and it works so well with the Gamepad you’ll wonder why it took Nintendo three years to release it. At its core Mario Maker isn’t really a game at all; it’s a set of tools for making your own game, one styled after Mario’s earliest adventures in 2D. It’s not a new idea — games like LittleBigPlanet and Disney Infinity have similarly tried to make game creation a big part of the experience. But none of those games grabbed me like Mario Maker has. I’ve played a lot of LittleBigPlanet, but most of that time was spent enjoying other people’s creations, not building my own. In Mario Maker, it’s the exact opposite. Part of that has to do with the controller. A standard gamepad with analog sticks and a bunch of buttons isn’t the best tool for level creation. It makes placing objects and manipulating terrain fiddly and annoying; LittleBigPlanet has done an admirable job of streamlining the process, but it’s far from ideal. A touchscreen, on the other hand, is perfect. Adding platforms for Mario to jump on, or enemies to avoid, is as simple as tapping the screen. If you want to fill a secret area with coins, you can scribble them in with the stylus. It’s easy to wrap your head around, especially because there’s so little explanation needed; anyone playing this game knows what a goomba or piranha plant is, so almost all of the objects you’re working with are familiar. Building stages in Mario Maker is like learning a language when you already know most of the words. Mario Maker gives you a few dozen objects to play around with — from power-ups to moving platforms to Bowser himself — and you can style your level in any of four different ways, each based on a classic Mario adventure: the original Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, and the more modern, 2.5D New Super Mario Bros. Each has its own distinct look and feel, and it’s fun to construct a level and then quickly see what it would look like in a different style. (It’s more than an aesthetic change too, as certain game elements, like Mario’s ability to wall jump in NSMB, will change depending on the theme.) You can also choose different level types, so you can make your dream level underwater, in a haunted house, or in your own take on Bowser’s castle. You won’t be able to play around with all of those tools from the outset. Mario Maker hides much of its content initially, and the only way to access it is simply to play. You don’t have to achieve any specific goals, but so long as you mess around in the creation mode for at least five minutes each day, a new batch of toys will be at your disposal the following day. It took me around a week to unlock everything. At first this was frustrating — my first idea for a level required warp pipes, which weren’t available for a few days — but in retrospect I think it’s for the best, especially for players who aren’t used to making games. I’m not a game designer by any stretch, and often when I play these kinds of games I’m overwhelmed by the sheer number of options. But in Mario Maker I started out building a really simple stage, and then as I unlocked content I was able to iterate on that core idea, revising the original concept into something more refined and complex. The timed structure comfortably eased me into what would otherwise be an intimidating experience. I’ve had a lot of fun building my own levels. There’s something satisfying about constantly tinkering with an idea, and being able to see (and play) the changes immediately. (This also makes the game a great fit for the Wii U’s off-TV play, since you can tinker with an idea on the Gamepad while catching up on episodes of Bojack Horseman on your TV.) If nothing else, playing Mario Maker gives you even more appreciation for the effort that goes into designing a Mario game. But I do wish there was more. When I think about why Super Mario World was so great, I don’t necessarily think about individual levels, but instead the ways those levels came together to create something bigger and more impressive. There’s a sense of progression to a Mario game that you simply can’t recreate in Mario Maker, because you’re only making individual levels, and not entire games. There’s no way to link levels together or have progress carry over from one to the next. (This has the added effect of rendering coins and 1UP mushrooms essentially useless.) So far I’ve made a trio of levels that ramp up in difficulty with purpose (at least that was my goal!), and it’s disappointing to know that when I upload those levels, they won’t be experienced the way I intended. It's the difference between making songs and making an album. That’s the other side of the Mario Maker experience: the online sharing component. In addition to making your own levels, you can also check out creations that other players have built and uploaded. It’s hard to really say how the community will respond once the game is out, though. Right now, those who are playing the game early seem primarily focused on creating gimmicky levels. One of the most popular stages, for example, is like a Rube Goldberg machine, where you simply press right on the d-pad and watch as Mario makes his way through an elaborate set-up, bouncing on blocks and riding moving platforms with no other input required. Another recreates a Donkey Kong level (by scanning amiibo, you can unlock various Nintendo character costumes for Mario to wear) complete with lots of vines to clamber around on. Most of the player creations simply try to create a ROM hack-style impossible level that few players will ever finish. These are often cool ideas, good for a single play, but I haven’t really found anything that scratched that classic Mario itch. Maybe that will change once more players start crafting levels, or maybe Nintendo really is just that good at designing games. But even if there isn’t a steady influx of player-created levels to enjoy, I don’t see myself getting bored with Mario Maker anytime soon. I’m the kind of person who has lots of ideas for levels, but never bothered to go through the effort to learn to code or design so that I could actually make them. Instead, when I was young I would sketch out levels on graph paper and just imagine what it would be like to play them. Mario Maker feels just like that, except I actually get to play my creations and share them with others — and I still have a lot of ideas. Super Mario Maker will be available on the Wii U on September 11th.

The film, directed by Peter Landesman, stars Will Smith as a doctor whose research on the long-term effects of repeated brain trauma sparked an ongoing controversy over the safety of professional football. A trailer for the movie, released this week, pits Smith's character in direct opposition with the NFL, but internal emails suggest that Sony, Landesman, and Smith's representatives aimed to soften its script and marketing. Some ""unflattering moments for the NFL"" were deleted or altered, according to an email sent last August, and one of Sony's top lawyers took ""most of the bite"" out of the movie ""for legal reasons with the NFL."" Other emails detail discussions of how to market the film; press materials should mention Smith's personal affinity for football, executives suggested. Others were concerned with vilifying the entire organization, rather than a few individuals. ""We'll develop messaging with the help of a NFL consultant to ensure that we are telling a dramatic story and not kicking the hornet's nest,"" Dwight Caines, Sony Pictures' director of domestic marketing, said in an email to executives in August 2014. A Sony spokeswoman tells the Times that the consultant was hired to work with the NFL, and was not an NFL employee. ""There was never an instance where we compromised the storytelling."" In the film, Smith plays Dr. Bennet Omalu, a Nigeria-born forensic pathologist who diagnosed a degenerative brain disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in NFL players. His work raised widespread concern over the safety of America's most popular sport, forcing the NFL to implement new ways of treating and studying concussions. The league also settled a multi-million dollar lawsuit brought by former players who accused the NFL of a cover-up. The league has pressured other media organizations over coverage of its concussion crisis in the past. In 2013, it forced ESPN to abandon its involvement with a Frontline documentary on the league's response to the crisis. (Frontline later aired the film on its own.) Unlike other Hollywood studios, Sony Pictures has no major business ties to the NFL, the Times reports. In an interview with the Times, Landesman confirmed that Sony's lawyers cut some parts of the film, though he said the changes were made in the name of accuracy, denying that the studio acted under pressure from the NFL. ""We don’t want to give the NFL a toehold to say, ‘They are making it up,’ and damage the credibility of the movie,"" Landesman said. He added: ""There was never an instance where we compromised the storytelling to protect ourselves from the NFL.""

The version 3.00 update — one of the biggest in the console's lifespan — was detailed on Sony's PlayStation blog today. Core among the new features is the increase in online storage capacity, bumped from the current 1 GB to 10 GB as standard for all players when the update rolls out. The PS4 uses this cloud storage for save files, but at present, it quickly fills up. In addition to increasing the capacity, the update will also add a meter that allows users to monitor their online storage, making it easier to check when you're about to run out of space and delete files accordingly. PlayStation 4 players could already stream live over Twitch, but the new update also adds the ability to stream live over YouTube, with streams visible, as the blog post notes, on the new YouTube Gaming mobile app and channel. YouTube launched the own dedicated video game streaming service earlier this week, the site's attempt to make a play for the millions of viewers who've flocked to the wildly successful Twitch. As well as longer game streams, Sony is also finding more use for the PS4 controller's dedicated share button for shorter videos, adding the ability to post 10-second clips of game footage direct to Twitter. People will be able to watch your PS4 streams on the new YouTube Gaming app and site Interface tweaks and community additions round out the 3.00 update. In-game events such as double-XP weekends will be flagged up in a new dedicated events hub, and users will be able to create communities around games or interests, each coming with a messageboard, a place for shared screenshots, and an easy way to join parties with other members. If you play together with the same set of people a lot, you'll soon be able to designate it as a favorite group, making getting your Destiny raid squad together much easier than it currently is. It'll also be simpler to jump into a friend's game from the Now Playing screen on console startup, and you'll be able to request to watch their session in action, should you want to do some backseat gaming. There's no set date for the update to arrive just yet, but Sony says people selected for the PlayStation beta program — which was expanded earlier this month — will get to try out the new features ""very soon."" The changes all sound welcome, but the company warns that it can't guarantee every feature described in the blog post will make it to your PS4 later this year, as some may be stripped out as feedback from the beta comes in.",0.6226818335487134,0.3773181664512866,0.8471104288247552,473,4.6701902748414374,262,5.5534351145038165,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming"

Miley Cyrus continues to be hilarious. But lo and behold, someone had to go and ruin my whole day. In an interview with the Daily Mail, new James Bond author Anthony Horowitz blurted out the kind of inanity worthy of Donald Trump — that Idris Elba is too ""street"" to play 007: ""For me, Idris Elba is a bit too rough to play the part. It’s not a colour issue. I think he is probably a bit too 'street' for Bond. Is it a question of being suave? Yeah."" Mr. Horowitz: Horowitz has been charged with writing the next Bond novel, Trigger Mortis, for the Fleming Estate. As such, it's probably reasonable to assume he knows a little about the James Bond character. But saying any accomplished black actor is too ""street"" to play a traditionally white role is the kind of thinly veiled racism that makes it so hard to advance any character in pop culture. Let's put the fact that Elba has stated he's no longer interested in playing Bond aside. Not suave? Are you kidding? What does that even mean? It can't be the iconic sophistication. Just look at him on the cover of Vanity Fair last year.   James Bond material. Is it his performances? Elba can be smooth and menacing at the same damn time:  James Bond material. Is it the affinity for alcohol? Because he already spent a few years as the face of Tanqueray gin:   James Bond material. Is it that Elba seems too rough? Too late; Daniel Craig already plays Bond like a barroom brawler. Particularly in Casino Royale, the movie Horowitz claims to love.  And for heaven's sake, what is ""street"" about playing a Norse god?  So what does ""street"" even mean in this context, if Elba exhibits all of James Bond's most iconic qualities? Given the context, Horowitz might have well have said thuggish. Horowitz is suggesting that Idris Elba has a presence that's little too lower class and a little too dangerous to play James Bond. His blackness isn't something white viewers can idealize, but instead comes across as unruly and uncultured — unlike someone like Horowitz's preferred choice, Adrian Lester, who is a fine black actor known for his Shakespearean roles. Horowitz seems to think Elba lacks the respectability needed to play Her Majesty's best murderer. Horowitz might as well have said thuggish This is bullshit. Horowitz might as well have hauled off and said, ""I'm not racist, but..."" which is one of the surest signs that you're, in fact, racist. It smacks of not wanting James Bond to wear a hoodie. That he's some stereotype waiting to besmirch the honor of MI6. And let's make something perfectly clear: casting choices for the next Bond is only a notch above arbitrary, and Horowitz is entitled to his opinion. But couching those preferences in the idea that seeing a large black man do violence is a little too off-brand for a sophisticated killer is nonsense and helps no one. Stop doing interviews, Anthony Horowitz. Just write your book and pray people read it.

Who knew? Welcome to This Month in Luxury, presented by Micah Singleton, The Verge's resident Luxury Director. In this monthly (or whenever we remember) column, I will take you on a completely superficial journey of opulence, pointing out one device, artifact, or service an upscale individual such as yourself would take pleasure in experiencing. Let the journey begin. As part of its ongoing effort to convince people with trust funds and personal shoppers at Barneys New York to use its new wearable, Apple has partnered with reputed French luxury house Hermès to create the Apple Watch Hermès, the first standalone collection for its smartwatch. While Hermès isn't exactly known for its watchmaking prowess, it is known as one of the premier leather goods manufacturers in the world. From the $1,675 compact leather wallets to $150,000 Birkin bags, Hermès has established itself as the leather goods supplier for yacht owners and leasers alike. Given Apple's dearth of skills when it comes to crafting leather — one watchmaker I spoke to described the leather loop band for the Apple Watch as ""rubbery"" and didn't believe it was even leather — having Hermès craft its watch bands is a shrewd move.   The question is do you want one? The Apple Watch Hermès isn't available in 18K gold like the Apple Watch Edition. (At least not officially, but that's never stopped anyone with bank accounts in countries they've never visited, has it?) It's your standard $500 Apple Watch, with Hermès' Single Tour, Double Tour, or Cuff watch straps along with special Hermès engravings on the buckle and on the rear of the watch case, and new watch faces featuring Hermès' custom font. Keeping the Hermès collection away from the overpriced Edition is one of the smartest things Apple has done with the Apple Watch. For every $100,000+ Birkin bag it sells, Hermès moves thousands of sub-$1,000 scarves, bracelets, and fragrances. While the ceiling of its price range may afford you a small Mediterranean cottage to house your teacup Pomeranian and store your overflow of Louis Vuitton luggage, Hermès makes most of its sales in a more affordable price bracket. Starting at $1,100 and topping out at $1,500, the Apple Watch Hermès is priced to sell, and with its limited availability — currently only available in 17 Apple and Hermès stores in the US — and stamp of approval from a legendary fashion house, it may just be the most luxurious watch Apple has made.

But there's confusion around whether the Moto X can actually utilize Wi-Fi calling on Fi, and some early tests seem to suggest it's only communicating with T-Mobile's network; the Nexus 6 intelligently hands off between T-Mobile and Sprint depending on which carrier has a stronger signal. So those quirks could definitely remove some of Project Fi's appeal.

And so here we are again, as preorders are now live on Apple's site. You can also preorder online with AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile (who makes you call in, which is insane), with shipments beginning on September 25th. As of this writing, you can't grab your new phone from Apple's website, which doesn't have a preorder option yet. An even better idea, as my colleague Chris Ziegler points out, is to do so through the Apple Store iOS app. The app is known to be more reliable than the website, which around now is being crushed by a mountain of traffic. Update: Read the iPhone 6S review. If you do use the Apple Store app, know that there may be a bit of wonkiness involved. Earlier today, Apple's site actually experienced a brief period of down time, and the store app also wasn't working. Before that, a ""Get ready to pre-order the iPhone 6S"" prompt within the app let you fill out your carrier settings and choose the device you want so when preorders are available, you only have a few buttons to press. Yet for some users, myself included, the pricing screen would only display one option, like the choice to use AT&T's Next financing plan or the option to only buy the device off-contract. It didn't appear to display more than one purchase option, so be sure to double check. For those who want to enroll in Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program, arguably one of the better deals around, you'll have to poke around the Apple Store app. Go to the ""shopping"" section, select iPhone, and then scroll to the bottom of the list. It's there below ""accessories,"" and will let you reserve the model of your choice and schedule a retail store appointment to pick it up. The Apple Store app is the way to go This year, Apple threw a bit of a curveball and moved the date from the standard Friday morning to Saturday, meaning poor East Coast residents eager to buy the iPhone 6S or 6S Plus are sitting here at 3:01AM. It's bittersweet because not having to work the next day makes the buying process notably less obnoxious, but having to sit at your computer or pull out your phone in the middle of the night is not a great way to kick off the weekend.   As far as prices go, Apple's iPhone 6S will cost you $649 (16GB), $749 (64GB), or $849 (128GB). For the iPhone 6S Plus, you'll have to plunk down an additional $100 over the cost of the 6S for whichever storage tier you want. AppleCare+ phone insurance and support now runs an additional $129, a $30 bump over last year. These prices may be a shock to those that are still accustomed to cellular carriers' two-year contracts and the $200 iPhone of years past. Yet most major telecom companies including AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon have begun following T-Mobile's lead and dropping support for these types of deals. Two-year contracts hurt customers in the long run and carriers have discovered that they also limit customers' ability to upgrade whenever they like. You can still get your hands on a two-year deal with certain carriers if you buy it from the company itself, like AT&T, but you'll save more money by picking up a month-by-month financing option like AT&T Next or Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program.",0.5319021880953557,0.4680978119046443,0.4627540928130955,593,4.5868465430016867,333,5.4714714714714718,0,2,"Apple, Mobile, Tech"

According to TechCrunch, Facebook is testing a new feature that allows people to temporarily set a new profile photo, which will then go away after a set number of hours, days, or weeks. Facebook tells TechCrunch that it's making the feature in response to the way that people often ""use their profile pictures to support a cause, root for a team, and commemorate milestones like birthdays and anniversaries."" The idea is that by setting a temporary picture, you can express how you're feeling at the moment and then have it revert back to normal when appropriate. Facebook reportedly wants to roll the feature out widely in the coming months. In the case of supporting sports teams or celebrating birthdays, this feature makes a lot of sense. It even seems like a fun way to show a bit more personality on a site that places so much value on the long term. But it's also easy to look at this cynically, since the most visible profile changes to spread across Facebook are done in support of causes, like to celebrate the Supreme Court's marriage ruling in June. If people were to put up rainbow-coated pictures using this temporary photo feature, there'd certainly be a lot less of them still around today. On the other hand, this feature may well make it easier for people to show support for different causes that they might otherwise let pass them by.

Various articles have been pointing out that Apple's new ""Hey Siri"" feature — which allows you to activate Siri at any time by saying that phrase — means that the iPhone 6S' microphone has to be on at all times. Likewise, articles have noted that Apple's new Live Photos feature — which captures just over a second of video before and after every photo you take — requires that the camera, when active, continually record your audio and video. Both features are able to be deactivated, but in order to make full use of the phone, it's expected that you'll have them on.  Apple says nothing leaves your phone until Siri is activated In a number of statements to TechCrunch, Apple is trying to clear up the concerns that people have around these features. For Siri, Apple says that all captured audio is processed locally. It isn't until your phone actually activates Siri that it'll begin sending audio off to Apple, which is what has always happened when Siri interprets (or attempts to interpret) your speech. ""In no case is the device recording what the user says or sending that information to Apple before the feature is triggered,"" Apple tells TechCrunch. Otherwise, it sounds as though the iPhone 6S will only store a few seconds of sound at a time and will continually write over — and therefore, theoretically, delete — what has been captured before it. Read next: The iPhone 6S review. There's very natural reason to be concerned about the fact that the iPhone 6S actively supports the ability to have — not to mention encourages the use of — an always-on and recording microphone. The privacy conscious may well not be comfortable with that. But the concern is not new, either. We've seen always-on voice assistant features in Android phones for a couple years now, typically with the same privacy models. Basically, if you're using a modern Android phone, it's likely doing much the same thing as what Siri is doing on the new iPhone. As for Live Photos, Apple tells TechCrunch much the same thing. Though the camera and microphone are constantly recording, nothing is saved until you actually take a photo — otherwise, it'll seemingly just be overwritten and vanish. ""The pre-captured images are not saved to the user’s device nor are they sent off the device,"" Apple tells TechCrunch. Apple has made a big deal about trying to be the company in Silicon Valley that cares about your privacy, so it makes sense to see it out there and trying to address these concerns. For the most part, these are pretty common sense answers paired with pretty expected behaviors. And really, they're not so bad — that is, so long as everything the iPhone captures actually does stay local to the device, and so long as that data is actually deleted unless you specifically want it saved. That said, it's worth keeping in mind that even privacy policies set with seemingly good intentions can fail.",0.509476756654279,0.49052324334572095,0.18600131372078144,525,4.8114285714285714,284,5.637323943661972,0,0,"Apple, Mobile, Tech"

Today, the space agency said that Philae hasn’t made contact since July 9th; efforts to re-establish communication over the following weekend were unsuccessful. It's possible that Philae has somehow moved. ESA scientists also don’t know exactly where Philae is on the space rock. The space agency is exploring the possibility that Philae has somehow moved on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the comet it landed on in November. Scientists believe that gas emissions from the comet may have altered Philae's orientation, meaning it might be in an area without sunlight. It also means that Philae's antenna may no longer be pointed directly toward Rosetta — the spacecraft that carried Philae to the comet. Rosetta remains in orbit around 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and the research team has been moving the spacecraft to different locations in order to get a lock on Philae. So far, they haven't had any luck.   67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is an object in the Kuiper Belt that is orbiting the Sun as fast as 84,000 mph. It was attractive to scientists as a landing target because its orbital path around the Sun made it easier for a prolonged survey and rendezvous with a spacecraft. Philae was the first spacecraft ever to land on a comet, as part of the ESA’s Rosetta mission (though we’ve slammed probes into comets before). But the landing wasn't exactly smooth; the lander suffered from a couple mechanical malfunctions, and Philae bounced off the comet's surface two to three times before coming to rest. The area where Philae finally settled turned out to be in the shadow of a nearby cliff or crater, blocking the sunlight needed to power the lander's batteries. So shortly after landing on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, Philae lost power and went into hibernation mode. ESA scientists said the lander would eventually reboot as the comet moved closer to the Sun, allowing sunlight to shine on the spacecraft's solar panels. The recent gap in contact suggests Philae isn’t receiving enough sunshine anymore. In June, the ESA announced that it had finally regained contact with Philae; the lander's solar panels were getting energy again. The Rosetta spacecraft picked up data from the lander and transmitted more than 300 data packets back to ground control. But the recent gap in contact suggests Philae isn’t receiving enough sunshine anymore. ""The profile of how strongly the Sun is falling on which panels has changed from June to July, and this does not seem to be explained by the course of the seasons on the comet alone,"" said Philae’s project manager, Stephan Ulamec, in a statement. It also looks like one of the two transmission units that Philae uses to send data is no longer working, and one of its two receiving transmission units is damaged. ESA is preparing several commands for Philae that will help the lander recommence operations with its faulty transmission units. But none of that will matter unless Rosetta can find Philae first.",0.33597130265668146,0.6640286973433185,0.7662508978163828,501,5.1437125748502996,274,6.0291970802919712,0,2,Science

Up until now, we've written about animals without telling you whether they suck or rule. We are now rectifying this oversight. Whiptail lizards are basically the Amazon warriors of the animal kingdom. All female, no filler Many species of whiptail lizards are all female. That's right: these badass ladies figured out how clone themselves, so they wouldn't have to bother having sex with males to maintain their species. This natural form of cloning is called ""parthenogenesis"" — and it isn't as complicated as it sounds.   Credit: bamyers4az / Flickr  First, let's talk about sex. During sexual reproduction, a sperm and an egg combine to form a fetus. For that to work, each parent supplies half the genetic material. So in female lizards that reproduce sexually, chromosomes — the packages that contain DNA — are duplicated inside cells, and then undergo two rounds of cell division. Each egg winds up with 23 chromosomes each, half the number that appear in normal cells. That way, when an egg and sperm cell merge, the right number of chromosomes combine to make healthy offspring. Female whiptail lizards don’t bother with sperm Female whiptail lizards don’t bother with sperm. They double the number of chromosomes in their reproductive cells twice before cell division begins instead — so at the end of the process, their eggs have the right number of chromosomes for a female clone. But here's the kicker: even though these species don't need to have sex to survive, female whiptail lizards still display mating behaviors, meaning that females sometimes mount other females. Scientists think this behavior is hormonally driven; high progesterone levels may cause females to mount others. But they probably don't just bump cloacal regions for funzies. Studies have shown that females who are mounted by another female are more fertile than those who go it alone, likely because the mounting behavior promotes ovulation. Did I mention that whiptail lizards are fabulous? They don't just bump cloacal regions for funzies Anyway, these lizards weren't always members of the ""no-boys-allowed"" club. Scientists think that they developed this mode of reproduction after a male member of one species mated with the female member of another species. The New Mexico whiptail, for example, is a hybrid that popped up after a Western whiptail mated with a little striped whiptail. Typically, hybrids are dead ends; they can't reproduce. But whiptail lizards couldn't care less about those silly biological rules. The females just started cloning themselves instead. (If males were generated from this union, they likely died off. Sorry, guys.)  Credit: Just Chaos / Flickr  And we have a lot of evidence for this idea because researchers were actually able to recreate this process in the lab by mating two different species of whiptail lizards in 2008. The resulting ""species"" — there's some debate over the use of this term — was called Aspidoscelis neavesi, after William Neaves, the scientist who first discovered whiptail lizards with four sets of chromosomes in 1967. By 2014, the scientists had amassed a colony of 200 lizards. Now, whiptail lizards aren't the only animals who can clone themselves. Unisexuality has been identified in more than 80 groups of amphibians, reptiles, and even fish. But many of those species do it under specific circumstances, like when males aren't available. Female Komodo dragons, for instance, sometimes engage in parthenogenesis. Whiptail lizards, on the other hand, clone themselves all the time. As a result, they're among the most studied parthenogenetic species; their evolutionary success has essentially turned them into the poster child for unisexuality. Unfortunately, the reason that they're so iconic might also end up causing their downfall. After all, sex has a ton of benefits! Sex is incredibly inefficient  Sure, sex is incredibly inefficient if you're looking to grow a species quickly; the fact that each individual needs to spend energy finding a mate and then convincing them to get it on is costly and extremely tedious. But mixing your DNA with another member of your species is a great way to build a diverse and resilient population. Whiptail lizards don't get to do that, and that's really risky. They end up having the same weaknesses — weaknesses that new parasites, diseases and predators are just begging to exploit. In addition, if something in their environment were to change drastically, they might not be able to adapt to survive the change. And in the long run, whiptail lizards won't get a chance to evolve into a stronger species. Unless something biologically crazy happens, this is it for them. But let's be honest, if all your species needs to populate a new habitat is a single individual, you're totally boss. Sure, you're going to be surrounded by a bunch of copies of yourself for the rest of your life, but if you can't love yourself, then how the hell you gonna love somebody else?

If there's one thing that cinema and Bruce Springsteen songs have taught us, it's that there's nothing freer than the open road. Or is there? Although it might feel that way, behind the scenes a huge array of technologies will end up controlling the progress you make along your route. The same goes for train and boat travel. And should you head to the airport, you will fly subject to the demands of air traffic control, monitoring other aircraft and the ever-changing weather. Welcome to the hidden world that controls our transport infrastructure, and it's getting more sophisticated all the time.  Behind the scenes a huge array of technologies will end up controlling the progress you make along your route Some of the subtle transport management techniques seem to be the stuff of urban myths — but they're very real. Take, for example, the ""green wave."" A green wave is when all the traffic lights into town conveniently turn green as traffic approaches, opening up an unhindered route to motorists. Synchronized lights It was a popular concept in Germany, where motorists were sometimes told that traveling at a certain speed would let them encounter consecutive green signals — a Grüne Welle. Today, green waves have become more sophisticated, with adaptive systems able to synchronize traffic lights when it is most advantageous and safe to do so. And it doesn't just stop at cars. In the Danish capital Copenhagen, the city has introduced green waves for its hordes of cyclists. Green waves have become more sophisticated, with adaptive systems able to synchronize traffic lights when it is most advantageous and safe to do so More accurate tracking of vehicles in real time is generally what makes this possible. In the UK, sensors hidden beneath roads such as Midas (Motorway Incident Detection and Automatic Signaling) allow traffic control rooms to monitor how congested a motorway has become. Midas detects the volume of vehicles passing over the tarmac in real time. At high volumes, traffic can be slowed down via variable speed limit signs, which allow cars to travel more closely together and therefore take advantage of the motorway's full capacity. This is often done ""upstream"" to prevent extreme cases of congestion which may already be forming. That's why seemingly smooth-moving traffic is sometimes gently forced to slow down, because that reduction in speed helps prevent congestion further behind. In towns and cities, a similar and widely used technology called Scoot (Split Level Offset Optimization Technique) can tweak traffic signals for particular types of vehicles, such as buses, or those which are arriving along especially busy routes. Nick Hounsell at the University of Southampton, an expert in transport research, says the dynamics of traffic movement are incredibly sensitive, which is why these clever, pseudo-intelligent systems are so useful. Hounsell points out one example, the ""butterfly effect,"" where a sudden slowing down — even something as simple as one driver braking a little too hard — can become amplified to a full-scale jam and even accidents happening further behind. River register ""Once a shockwave forms you will get stationary traffic,"" he says. ""The shockwave moves and the potential then for a nose-to-tail accident is quite high."" One classic cause of these shockwaves is ""rubbernecking,"" in which drivers slow down to look at accidents in nearby lanes. Easy solutions for this have been found, though. Britain's Department of Transport simply decided to hide them from view, using screens. Ideally, managing traffic using all these techniques would help to reduce crashes and fatalities in the first place. Paul Unwin at the UK's Highways Agency notes that since the introduction of a smart motorway system on one of the country's busiest routes, safety has improved considerably. ""We've not had a fatality on the M42 since 2006,"" he claims. Similar principles to these are found off the roads. The Port of London Authority (PLA), for example, has found that it makes sense to slow river traffic on the Thames so that vessels further up the river may turn sharply or berth. The PLA tracks which boats are where and what's on them — be it passengers or cargo — using a register known as Thames AIS, which stands for Automatic Identification System. It's particularly useful on a river like the Thames, which has both a lot of traffic and a lot of bends, making it hard for captains to see what's ahead and react accordingly. Having a complete overview of traffic is probably what you'd expect nowadays, but as recently as 1989 controllers had nowhere near this level of visibility. That year a Thames pleasure boat, the Marchioness, collided with a dredger and sank, resulting in the deaths of 51 people. ""All the investigations that followed changed forever the way we deal with safety and navigation on the Thames,"" explains Kevin Gregory at the PLA. ""Because we were determined that we would never have something like that happen again."" Up in the air Safety concerns are also behind the fastidious traffic control we see in the air. Tens of thousands of flights take off and land every day around the world and it's largely down to air traffic controllers to get them up and down again without accidents. Nats, which used to be known as National Air Traffic Services, handles about 5,000 flights a day in the UK alone. It has recently been trying out its own clever technologies to help increase capacity and safety. A recent addition to the air traffic controller's toolbox is iFACTS, which predicts aircraft trajectories and lets operators peer up to 18 minutes into the future to see where planes will be at that time. A ""conflict"" in air traffic control is when a plane is predicted to move within a certain distance of another aircraft. iFACTS allows controllers to prevent this ahead of time, and more confidently schedule planes through sectors of airspace. ""We had a 20 percent increase in overall capacity based on the introduction of iFACTS because the workloads on the controllers was that much less,"" says Stuart McBride, customer and network service manager at Nats. This happened because controllers didn't have to take the time to make such drastic adjustments to a plane's course when conflict was getting close. Instead, minor adjustments which are easier to do could be made further ahead of time. Another company, Airbus ProSky, has a product that calculates optimum arrival times for planes so that connections aren't missed and less fuel is used. In order to do that, the software has to calculate data on all the flights coming to and leaving from a given airport. The company's CEO, Paul-Franck Bijou, says the amount of information going into these calculations is gargantuan. ""For one airport, it's about the size of the database for a bank like Credit Agricole in France for example, the size of a national bank,"" he says. ""This is what we're talking about with regard to data we're handling at just one airport. Imagine what we're talking about for a whole country."" Natural solutions? That's the thing about traffic; the greater the volume, the sooner capacities are reached. But capacity can become flexible if vehicles and the systems which control their movements become smarter, and don't need to be constantly controlled by us. That's the thing about traffic; the greater the volume, the sooner capacities are reached In the future, the way all of this is done could look quite different from today. Researchers are increasingly looking to the animal kingdom for inspiration. Ants, for instance, have helped researchers create ""bio-inspired algorithms,"" which allow traffic to move in a similar way ants hunting for food; the insects automatically find preferred routes, without any central control. This approach allowed J.J. Merelo at the University of Granada to design a program that could tell the Spanish military how to route vehicles during a training simulation. Bats, too, could prove useful teachers to help manage tomorrow's air traffic. Rolf Mueller at Virginia Tech's Department of Mechanical Engineering has been studying Chinese bats in order to better understand how the animals are able to fly in such dense swarms even in tight areas. A 3D scan of their cave was taken and an array of infrared cameras captured the bats' movement. One day, Mueller believes a system similar to this could manage aircraft in busy pockets of airspace. ""The bats are not afraid of touching each other. They come very close but in a very controlled manner, they know what they're doing,"" he says. ""They don't have to get in touch with air traffic flow control and say, ‘Should I fly now to the right of that guy or the left of that guy?' They make those decisions automatically."" Mueller observed that this remained true even when his team placed unfamiliar obstacles in the cave. Unflinching, the bats simply flew around them and carried on. What if planes were just as safe to fly in? Nats' Stuart McBride says capacity could be increased if planes didn't have to be so far apart from one another. Man-made traffic has often reached a point where behind-the-scenes control is not just essential, but also increasingly automated In all these areas — road, sea, or air — man-made traffic has often reached a point where behind-the-scenes control is not just essential, but also increasingly automated. It means that the traveller is ever further away from knowing why the traffic around him or her flows the way it does. The sense of being a cog in a distantly operated machine may be disarming to some, but it's testament to the sophistication of systems that keep the world's traffic moving. The ""driver,"" simply, has become split up. He or she is part human, part vehicle, part road, and computer.

The SpaceX explosion on June 28th was caused by a failed strut in the rocket's upper stage liquid oxygen tank, SpaceX chief executive officer Elon Musk said today. The strut was one of several hundred inside the tank used to hold down the helium pressure vessels, which help to pressurize the rocket. According to Musk, the strut was designed to handle 10,000 pounds of force, but failed at just 2,000 pounds of force. ""This is the best of what we know thus far."" Nearly a month ago, SpaceX's Falcon 9 disintegrated during its ascent to the International Space Station. SpaceX has a contract with NASA to launch commercial resupply missions to the station; that rocket launch was the seventh of 12 planned missions. The Falcon 9 was carrying 4,000 pounds of supplies, including food and water for the station's crew and a new International Docking Adaptor. The IDA, meant to be mounted on the outside of the station, will allow future US crewed spacecrafts from commercial spaceflight companies to dock with the ISS. SpaceX and Boeing have contracts to ferry astronauts to the ISS beginning in 2017. At the 2015 ISS Research and Development Conference, Musk described the failure as a ""huge blow for SpaceX."" Until the June incident, SpaceX had an impeccable launch record. This recent rocket loss was the first major failure out of 19 total Falcon 9 launches. As a result of the accident, SpaceX has postponed its launches of the Falcon 9 for the next couple of months. Their potential next launch, which was originally scheduled for August 9th, was meant to carry the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Jason-3 Earth observation satellite to orbit. However, it's unclear what SpaceX's next launch will be. Musk said the launch postponement will result in hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue.

The project, known as Breakthrough Listen, will allow researchers to scan the skies for signs of alien life over the next 10 years, covering 1 billion stars closest to Earth and 100 galaxies beyond the Milky Way. According to The New York Times, two-thirds of Milner's money will be used to build equipment and hire astronomers, with the remainder used to rent out two of the world's largest radio telescopes, in West Virginia and Australia. Observation time at these telescopes has been limited for researchers, but Milner's funding will greatly expand their access. In an interview with Business Insider, Milner said the project will scan 10 times more of the sky than any previous effort, while covering a wider range of radio frequencies. He said it will also process data 100 times faster than before. Scientists will focus their search on electromagnetic signals sent by aliens, rather than evidence of non-intelligent lifeforms. ""We have a responsibility to not stop searching."" The team of researchers, based out of the University of California-Berkeley, includes Lord Martin Rees of Cambridge University, a former director of the NASA Ames Research Laboratory, and other leading astronomers. Frank Drake, the American astrophysicist who founded the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program, will also serve as an advisor. Milner, who made a fortune off of early investments in Facebook and Twitter, also announced a $1 million competition, called Breakthrough Message, to create messages that could be sent to aliens. The 53-year-old billionaire pursued a PhD in physics before going into business, and was named after Yuri Gagarin, the Soviet astronaut who was the first person to enter outer space. Breakthrough Listen, he says, was inspired by Hawking, whom Milner describes as the project's ""ideological leader.""

Favoring the study of pathogens that directly impact humans has an obvious immediate benefit, but research on other pathogens — those that don't infect humans yet — could minimize, or even eliminate, the risk of human infection before it occurs. In the study, researchers conducted a review of research on infectious diseases that are shared between wild animals and livestock, dating back to 1912. Thanks to an automated search and indexing approach, the researchers were able to classify 15,998 studies by disease, animal, and geography. Rabies and salmonellosis have gotten a lot of attention The analysis showed that out of 113 diseases studied, a total of 10 diseases — diseases like rabies and salmonellosis — received half of the research attention. ""These 10 diseases, almost all of which can be spread from animals to people, have dominated the research agenda since the 1960s,"" says Siobhan Mor, an epidemiologist at the University of Sydney and a co-author of the study. The study also showed that researchers tend to focus on certain main livestock and wildlife groups, like cattle, whereas less popular animals — bats and pigs, for instance — don't get as much attention. This might mean that diseases that involve cows are more important when it comes to transmission, but it could also indicate that scientists and the people who fund them have favorites, not to mention a limited understanding of diseases that impact less popular species. A lot of diseases don't start out as human diseases Unsurprisingly, diseases that can be transmitted to humans are more popular study subjects than ones that can't. Given that many diseases don't start out as human diseases, this indicates that scientists probably have to play catch-up whenever a new disease starts to infect humans. ""Take MERS for example: we now know that the virus was circulating in camels decades ago but that discovery only came to light when researchers started to investigate a human health problem in the Middle East,"" Mor says. ""That’s a pattern we’re seeing time and time again; a new disease appears in humans, and livestock or wildlife are implicated after the fact."" Finally, the study hints that intense media coverage of a given disease or wildlife-livestock interaction leads to better funding. This trend could mean that funding is ""driven by the perceptions of disease, rather than by the actual costs or consequence,"" says Christan Gortazar, an epidemiologist at the University of Castilla, in Spain, who didn't work on the study. The world has seen 186 confirmed cases of MERS — a disease that infected camels way before it infected humans — since May 20th. Of those, 36 cases resulted in death. And 842 people have been diagnosed with the H5N1 avian influenza virus since 2003, half of whom died. As a result, researchers have spent a tremendous amount of time trying to find interventions that can stop these diseases, or minimize their effects. Still, few studies have looked at the global patterns that these types of diseases create when polled together. That's why this study matters; it's a window into the diseases and animals that get research attention and funding — and those that don't. Funding is ""driven by the perceptions of disease."" ""Many new diseases in humans — such as MERS, SARS, and H5N1 influenza — have their origins at this interface, a trend which scientists say is increasing,"" Mor says. Yet ""we have a tendency to prioritize human health and only regard animal health as important if and when it impacts on humans."" If wildlife and livestock sectors had the resources to investigate and manage animal health issues before they became an issue for humans, they might be able to reduce the spread of diseases in animals, which would help minimize their economic impact — not the mention the likelihood of human infection.",0.34960542161917485,0.6503945783808252,0.3113291693611583,681,5.093979441997063,335,6.044776119402985,0,0,"Science, Report"

Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, Uber's general manager for Western Europe, and Uber France CEO Thibaud Simphal were taken into police custody yesterday in Paris, a few days after French taxi unions staged a nationwide strike in protest against UberPop. As AFP reports, the executives and Uber France have been charged with misleading business practices, complicity in operating an illegal taxi service, and illegal treatment of personal data. They will go before a correctional court on September 30th. French taxi drivers have long held grievances against UberPop, which connects passengers with non-professional drivers. Taxi unions argue that the service gives Uber an unfair competitive advantage, because UberPop drivers are not required to obtain professional licenses or insurance, as other chauffeurs are. An ongoing investigation French officials have said the service is illegal under a law passed late last year, which strengthens regulatory requirements for chauffeur services. Police raided Uber's Paris offices in March, as part of an ongoing investigation into UberPop. Uber has contested the law, and the service has been allowed to continue pending a ruling from France's constitutional court, but authorities have toughened their stance on UberPop following last week's taxi strike.

I couldn’t help but tune in for the final one with the now-disbanded cast, especially knowing that it was clearly going to be unlike any other. Yesterday, BBC aired it — and it starts with a literal elephant in the room. While the show has always been rife with controversy, this series has been particularly controversial. Series 22 — the last starring Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May, it would turn out —  started with a trip to Patagonia where the trio made numerous references to the Falklands War, a deadly 1982 conflict with Great Britain. This stirred up enough anger with Argentinian locals that the entire crew was forced to flee to Chile in the middle of the night. Throughout the series, Chilean flags have been prominently displayed in the studio and even worn on the presenters’ lapels. Clarkson had already come under fire for referring to a Burmese man by a racial epithet in the previous season's finale. The final straw was a fistfight Clarkson had with a producer over catering that ended in his suspension (and eventual dismissal) from the show.  Off-screen controversies set the tone for the series finale And off-screen controversies set the tone for this series finale. Richard Hammond and James May stand in an empty Top Gear studio in front of a life-size model of an elephant to fulfill the end of their contracts. May jumps in to set the tone by saying ""… and tonight’s program is not, as I’m sure you’ve guessed, a normal one"" before going on to introduce the first segment on classic motoring, filmed before Clarkson’s unceremonious departure. That first segment was a solid piece where the three bought old cars on a budget and fixed them up as producers interrupted them with envelopes directing them on their journey. This segment would have been a good final sendoff, as the parallels between three old cars trying to get by in a modern era were well done. The group went to a car meet-up with a bunch of kids in Japanese cars drifting circles around them and struggled through pub trivia about Top Gear; Clarkson wound up breaking down on the way to the final classic car and air show. But then the show started breaking down in the second half. The task was once again to buy used cars and run through a series of tasks — this time, SUVs to tackle outdoor lifestyle activities. Unfortunately, there wasn’t much substance to the segment, leaving the show to end on a particularly awkward note. Brief (and genuinely heartfelt) goodbyes from Hammond and May wrapped the show. Needless to say, it wasn’t a satisfying end for one of the most controversial and entertaining teams of personalities on television. The show will never be the same There was a Top Gear before Clarkson, Hammond, and May. There will be a Top Gear after, too, but the show will never be the same. While their politics and antics have been polarizing, their on-screen chemistry introduced car culture to an entire generation who might not have experienced it otherwise.

At 10:21AM ET Sunday, SpaceX’s uncrewed Falcon 9 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, en route to the International Space Station. Perched atop the rocket was the company’s Dragon cargo capsule, packed full of food, science experiments, and other supplies for the ISS’ crew. For over two glorious minutes, the vehicle looked magnificent as it ascended toward the heavens. And then it exploded.  The failure sent shockwaves throughout the spaceflight community — SpaceX, until now, had a reputation for reliability. This was the company’s seventh commercial resupply mission for NASA; the launch was otherwise routine. Out of 19 total Falcon launches, this is the first one to end in complete failure. As a nation, we are limited when it comes to getting cargo to the ISS Fortunately, the astronauts aboard the ISS are in no immediate danger of going hungry. The station is well-stocked until late October. A Russian Progress cargo craft is slated for launch on July 3rd, and the Japan-made HTV cargo craft is supposed to launch sometime in August.  Yet the explosion highlights just how limited our options are for getting cargo to the ISS. Since the retirement of the shuttle program in 2011, NASA has been dependent on Russian technology to get supplies and astronauts to the ISS. The existence of SpaceX, which can restock the station using American-made vehicles, has lessened that reliance. That’s important, since relations between Russia and the United States have been tense since the Ukraine crisis. Last year, NASA announced they would accept American companies’ bids to send astronauts to the ISS for the first time since 2011. SpaceX and Boeing secured spots to launch people from US soil in 2017. But it’s possible that yesterday’s failure could spell problems for SpaceX’s relationship with NASA. And that may mean the US remains reliant on Russian rocket engines. Russia's Space Grip Russia dominates the spaceflight industry; it’s the only country currently capable of launching people to the ISS. The Russian space agency’s Soyuz rocket is the sole ride to space for NASA astronauts, and it also sends the Progress resupply ship into orbit. These trips on the Soyuz don’t come cheap — NASA pays $70 million to send a single astronaut to the ISS. Without other options, though, NASA has to pay or its people don’t fly.   It’s not just the Soyuz. The Russian space industry consists of more than 100 different contractors and developers. Many major players in the American private spaceflight sector rely on Russian technology in some form, usually in their rocket engines. Orbital Sciences plans to use RD-181 engines in its latest version of the Antares, which are produced by Moscow-based company NPO Energomash. RD-180 engines, also produced by Energomash, are used in the United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V. ""We’re too reliant on Russia, and I think NASA regrets that and Congress regrets that; we’re funding an unfavorable government,"" Eric Stallmer, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, tells The Verge. ""...We’re a great space nation, and we should have a capable human spaceflight program."" ""We’re funding an unfavorable government."" That’s why SpaceX is so attractive to NASA: It promises rides to space with all U.S. hardware. The Falcon 9 is made in America by American engineers with American engines, avionics, and ground controls.  But if SpaceX halts its launches while it investigates this failure, there aren’t many other options for sending cargo into space on American-built rockets. (The company has already postponed its next scheduled launch.) NASA could turn to ULA, a joint venture between American companies Lockheed Martin and Boeing. And there’s still Orbital Sciences, the other winner of the commercial resupply contract, though the company can’t launch cargo just yet; after experiencing an explosion on the launch pad last year, Orbital has been sidelined as it works to replace its rocket engines. That’s all of the American options, though NASA could still turn to Russia or Japan to send up cargo.  SpaceX is also one of the cheapest options too. NASA paid SpaceX around $1.6 billion for 12 cargo flights. That’s about $133 million per launch, compared to an average launch cost of $225 million from ULA. SpaceX claims it will be able to launch humans for about $58 million per ride, beating Russia’s price by more than $10 million. ""It’s not a good thing for our country that we have really one low-cost launch provider,"" James Muncy, co-founder of the Space Frontier Foundation, tells The Verge. ""But before SpaceX, we had zero. So it’s really important that SpaceX succeeds, and we have other private organizations enter the competition. We’re not going to have the revolution in space we want to have unless we have more cheap access to space."" The Future Of Commercial Crew Sunday’s crash also has implications for the future of SpaceX within NASA’s Commercial Crew Program — the bid SpaceX won in 2014 to send people to the ISS. The lost Falcon was bringing up a new docking adaptor, one that would allow SpaceX’s Dragon crew capsule to attach to the station. ""I don’t think there’s any reason to believe they won’t move forward."" Sunday’s explosion may prove worrisome, though, since an updated Falcon 9 is meant to carry the SpaceX crew capsule — with crew — to space. However, NASA administrator Charlie Bolden says NASA will stand by the company, and Muncy agrees the space agency won’t waiver in its commitments. ""I don’t think there’s any reason to believe they won’t move forward. NASA and SpaceX have developed a really good relationship,"" says Muncy. ""They have made mistakes in the past, they’ve learned from them, exchanged ideas... NASA is going to have an eye over SpaceX’s shoulder as they conduct their review.""   However, regulators might not be so confident with the company, and politicians may see these recent failures as a reason to cut off funding or restructure the commercial incentive programs. Such political fallout has been seen before in the spaceflight world. In the wake of NASA’s Columbia disaster, an investigation board was formed to determine the cause of the accident and issue recommendations for moving forward. In a 2003 report, that board ultimately recommended to ""recertify,"" or update, the Space Shuttle in 2010. The following year in 2004, the Bush Administration modified that advice, calling for the cancellation of the Shuttle program instead. Yet both Muncy and Stallmer agree that the main takeaway from such incidents shouldn’t be skepticism towards spaceflight. Instead, these issues should embolden our resolve and show us how we have been falling behind in the private sector. ""Congress needs to increase the funding and not have this budget uncertainty hanging over the contractors’ heads,"" says Stallmer. ""Cutting the Commercial Crew budget — that’s no way to go about conducting a successful launch program. There will be skeptics, but you have to ask the simple question: What other alternatives are out there?""

As we found out back in September, it's a problem that Adobe has been actively working with Google to solve. The two companies have been working together for almost two years to bring Photoshop to the browser, and they finally have a working version called Photoshop Streaming that they're letting educational institutions apply to test over the next six months. Yesterday, I got a look at it in action when Adobe's director of engineering, Kirk Gould, remotely ran me through a brief demo of the program. Adobe will test it for about six months in the education sector The way it works is pretty simple. The application is downloaded via the Chrome Web Store, and when you open it up you're actually connecting to a server which is running the desktop version of Photoshop CC 2014. The UI of the desktop version is captured as a video and sent to your browser, where javascript relays your actions back to the server, completing the interactive loop. It's not much different from how a virtual machine setup works, but it means that the application could be run in the browser on any computer — even on Chromebooks. Adobe essentially wants to let you stream a pound-for-pound copy of Photoshop, and Gould said the company is about 90-percent there.   It does, however, have its limits. Right now, Photoshop Streaming works exclusively with files hosted on Google Drive, but Gould said Adobe hopes to add the ability to work with other cloud storage services down the road. There are core functions that don't work in the program at the moment, such as printing, or processes that require a GPU like Photoshop's 3D functions. Otherwise, everything from making layer masks to using the Camera Raw editor works, though it was difficult to judge the amount of lag over the screen sharing software. Gould was able to quickly open a 30mb PSD file and make some quick edits to it. Adobe will use the trial period to build out functionality and troubleshoot the overall experience from the feedback it gets. Many educational institutions are full of people working with low-end hardware — which is what Adobe wants to optimize the program for. Gould says that once Adobe feels comfortable with the experience it will open up the trial to a broader audience and — someday — a commercial release.",0.4603868984554772,0.5396131015445228,0.27915248506962137,423,4.874704491725768,253,5.7470355731225293,0,2,"Apps, Design, Photography, Tech"

For the past three years, State of Play, a small studio in London, has been building a 10-foot-tall miniature city out of paper, cardboard, and lots of little lights.  There are houses and gardens, and at the center there's an 8-foot-tall water wheel, powered by a custom set of motors and built using cardboard cut by lasers. It's a huge, intricate world, and starting next week it's one you'll be able to explore in a video game with the launch of Lumino City. ""I was enjoying the process so much at the beginning that I joked that I could work on this for three years,"" says creative director Luke Whittaker, who originally estimated it would take a little over a year to complete the game. ""I had no idea it would actually come true."" Lumino City is actually the sequel to Lume, a short puzzle adventure released in 2011 that was similarly built using real-world materials. It tells the story of Lumi, a young girl who follows a series of clues to restore power to her grandfather's house. It was a short experience, one that was always intended to be part of a much bigger world. But the team started small both because they didn't have the resources, and because they weren't sure if they could actually pull it off. ""But we had a hunch, and a small amount of spare time, and so we took the first part of the story we wanted to tell and turned that into Lume,"" Whittaker. When it came to the sequel, building the city involved a somewhat unique team. In addition to Whittaker, who worked on animation, design, and even built some models, staff members included an architect, a director of photography, and a model maker; all told, six people worked on the game. Building the sets and characters was naturally very time-consuming, but the trickiest part was making it all work and feel natural in a video game world. Getting the animation and lighting just right so that the paper looked and moved the way you'd expect proved to be an arduous task, one that helped double the expected development time. There are a number of games that use a similar papercraft aesthetic, such as Media Molecule's Tearaway on the PS Vita. But State of Play avoided that route for a few reasons. For one thing, using real paper made it much more feasible for a small team to create a realistic-looking world, as opposed to employing dozens of artists and developers to craft a virtual version. But it also added an extra, intangible feel to the overall experience. ""There’s such a sense of warmth you can give to a story using real materials,"" Whittaker explains. The resulting experience is a rarity, a video game that's literally handmade. The tiny details and charming animation lend Lumino City a distinct and wonderful personality; whether you're operating an old-school computer with a punchcard, or just watching lights twinkle in the distance, it all feels like a children's book come to life. And you'll be able to experience it very soon: the game launches on PC, Mac, and Linux on December 3rd. For Whittaker, he knew that the game was on the right track part way through development, when they finally finished building the huge waterwheel, the biggest object in the game. ""To others it probably just looks like a large bit of wood, spinning,"" he says. ""But to me it was almost literally a dream coming true.""

The problem is that unless you're building a home from scratch, most people are going to be adding these smart features in a piecemeal fashion. Each device has to justify its price tag over cheaper, more conventional appliances. The August Smart Lock brings a couple of enticements to the table, starting with its design. Crafted by the legendary Yves Behar, the August lock is a gleaming, modernist beauty. More importantly, it's social. Because the ""keys"" to the lock are just some code executed by a phone, you can use the app to send ""keys"" to anyone you like.

Our host Alexis Ohanian sat down with August to discuss the challenge of taking a hardware startup from an idea, to a prototype, to a finished product at a store near you. The rise of crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo has helped to provide hardware startups with seed capital from curious consumers who don't mind dealing with products still in beta mode. August decided to skip that step, raising venture capital the traditional way and relying on its well-known designer and a press tour to generate interest, awareness, and demand. After all, this wasn't a pain point that really needed explaining. ""The past two years I've been working on this, if there is a phrase I've heard more than anything, it's 'I hate keys.'"" That's how August co-founder and CEO Jason Johnson described the company's market research. Speaking from personal experience, the struggle is real. As Johnson notes, in New York City alone, two million people per year get locked out of their own homes.

It was hit with a massive security breach and announced that it was spinning out PayPal, a divorce precipitated by the overwhelming investor sentiment that eBay was holding PayPal back. Still, the company has shown steady growth and profit, giving it the breathing room it needs to try and reinvent itself. Its newest adventure takes eBay into the world of offline retail: a partnership with the designer Rebecca Minkoff for new ""smart stores"" in New York and San Francisco. With PayPal gone, eBay needs new growth areas Walking into the store, shoppers are greeted with massive mirrors that double as touchscreens. They can browse the aisles the old-fashioned way, or swipe through the store’s inventory. Rather than lugging an armful of clothes to the dressing room, you simply tap the items you want to try on. When everything is ready to try on, you get a text alert. Oh, and feel free to order a drink while you’re at it.  The dressing room has another mirror that doubles as a touchscreen. You can adjust the lighting to see how your outfit would look in different settings. If you like the style, but it's not quite the right fit or color, you don’t have to trudge back out to the floor or shout for your shopping buddy to bring you another option. All the clothes have RFID tags in them, so the room recognizes the items and knows what’s in stock. With the press of a button you can have a stylist bring you that look in another color or size. The dressing room recommends accessories that match The RFID tags also let the room recognize the outfit you’re trying on and suggest accessories to complement it. Whatever you try on is saved to your personal profile, so you can pass on something but easily purchase it later online. Along with this, eBay also hopes to offer shoppers personalized recommendations based on this offline shopping experience. Of course, once the fitting is finished, you can pay with a PayPal account without ever having to head to the register. Our sister site Racked has written about the new eBay smart store a few times and have been very skeptical it would be anything special or worthwhile.

The year was 1981, and Sony was on the cusp of a revolution — the first Walkman had been released just 18 months earlier. What better time to redesign a logo dating from the ‘50s? But the company didn't enlist a design team to come up with a new logo. No, Sony decided to make the redesign a public spectacle. It launched the so-called ""Sony International Logotype Design Contest,"" and it took in nearly 30,000 submissions from around the world. A committee was formed and viewed every single entry before narrowing the list down to 59. The finalists were shown to the board of directors, company executives, designers, and sales managers. As executives were looking through the finalists, Sony must have realized it had made a huge mistake. That's when Sony realized it made a huge mistake Redesigning a company's brand identity is a delicate and complex process that must be taken with care. It's not rare for companies to explore a redesign before discovering through that process that its old design is the best of them all. But by putting the entire affair in the public eye, Sony essentially obligated itself to change its logo. Worst of all, the company would have to choose a logo designed by an amateur to be the face of its brand. As you might expect, the designs weren't up to snuff. It's a lot harder than it looks to create a timeless logo. According to Sony's official history, co-founder Masaru Ibuka ""decided that none of the designs was better than the original one."" And so the company moved to gracefully end the whole affair: a panel of judges chose three finalists, and instead of awarding first, second, and third place prizes, it split the prize money equally. An ad was published in Time Magazine thanking everyone for their time and effort, and it quietly noted that ""until the time comes in the future that we decide to make a change, the Sony logo will remain the same."" The design contest then faded into memory. But thanks to designer Greg Prichard, who stumbled across the ad while perusing through a 1981 issue of Time, we can now see the top three designs. The logos are very much products of their time, and we can't help but thank Sony for sticking with its roots.

They’re simple, tame, and accessible icons that work wonders if you want convey basic emotions. But when it comes to sexting, they're pretty inadequate. Winky faces, eggplants, and bananas have their uses, of course, but if you want to be a little sexier, you’re going to have to use your words.  Fortunately, four designers in California have come up with a solution, and they're calling it ""Flirtmoji"" — sexy stickers designed to look like emoji that you can paste into messaging apps as needed. The project launched on Tuesday, so The Verge contacted Katy McCarthy, one of two artists attached to the project, to talk about the design process. This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. How did Flirtmoji come to be? It’s been many months in the making. All four of us had experience with jokingly and poorly substituting the existing emojis into text conversations to try to communicate sex, and it never worked. But the game-changer came because one of the guys in the group was having really elaborate texting engagement back and forth with a long distance girlfriend. We realized that we needed to do this, to draw up sex as icons, and make it completely comprehensive, funny, and diverse.    Well, I did draw them! And that’s so beautiful, coming from another woman, that she saw that. We had so much dialogue about [the drawings]. The boobs, in particular, were really hashed out. Everyone looked at them, everyone talked about them, everyone had their two cents, and then being the only woman in a group of guys discussing body parts, obviously there are moments that are a little hairy, but… …That’s an interesting choice of words.  Well yea that’s a whole other conversation, because how do you make hair in simple line strokes? Right, so I noticed that the free set of Flirtmoji don’t have hair, and I was wondering about that decision. Is that something your team discussed? I’m really glad you’re bringing that up because I feel like I’m being held accountable for that. Hair has actually been really contentious and funny and also a major design issue, all while being a major conceptual necessity to all of us. I support hair; I have hair. I think it’s really important, and actually making it come across has been incredibly difficult. But we do have a few new ones that have hair, and we’re working on it. ""Hair has actually been really contentious and funny — and also a major design issue.""   I’m not surprised that you discussed hair in that way because from what I can tell, Flirtmoji seems really sex-positive and diverse.  It looks like you put a lot of thought into including different races, kinks, and sexual orientations. Why was that important to you? Well, for obvious reasons. My friends and I are not accurately represented in emoji, and it’s frustrating. And particularly with sex, we felt that it was so crucial that everyone feel sexually represented. We wanted to be able to show this to all of our friends and have them all feel comfortable. We wanted them to be able pick their own body parts in the Emoji — within the limits of size and colors. So we invited a ton of people to come look at them and to provide feedback. We wanted them to tear it apart, or say ""yes, this is good and I feel safe."" It’s not supposed to be college frat humor, although part of being inclusive is making it funny. It’s just not that hard to have everybody feel represented. ""Particularly with sex, we felt that it was so crucial that everyone feel sexually represented.""  Some of these, like the vulva in particular, are really detailed and surprisingly anatomically correct. Did you have to think about ways to also make them sexy? Well that’s the meat of the project. That’s where some of the most heated debate came out. To pass our test, the drawings have to be sex-positive. Anyone has to be able to look at them and not feel offended. There’s definitely a ton that didn’t make the cut. But some people will probably find these offensive anyway. Well sex-positive and offensive... there’s definitely a judgment call on that. There are people who will be very deeply offended — people who are offended by certain sexualities — but we’re not worried about those people. I mean, get your shit together. People are having sex, and it looks like this. And yes, part of being inclusive is that it’s all sexy. Even if it’s not my thing, necessarily, I wanted the Flirtmoji to be sexy because it’s someone else's thing and it’s sexy to them.  When you started the project, did you also look up other adult emoji or stickers to see if there was anyone else trying to do what you’re doing? Yes, absolutely. We did a lot of research and tried to always stay connected, because we felt that what we were working on was so obvious and important that there’s no way that we’re the only ones doing this. But seeing what's out there was pretty surprising. People have put together bad collections, thoughtless collections, offensive collections... Actually one project that’s different, and that we admire is the Lesbian Emoji project. When that came out, we thought, ""Oh this is cool."" And it also scared us because we wondered if there would be room for everyone. But ultimately, I think they’re doing something very different — they're tapping into a lot more of a niche. What we're doing sits differently for me, because we’re making this really comprehensive little visual language that represents everybody and everything.   A lot of people have written about Emoji, and they've discussed whether they hinder conversations or enhance them. What do you think of that? When’s the right time to use emoji, or sex emoji? What’s really beautiful about sex, and emoji, is that sex is really playful and also really difficult. And at the core of good sex is good communication. So to that end, I think that whatever it takes for you to be able to communicate what you want or need, or what you don’t want and don’t need is fine. With other emoji, there's definitely a time and a place.  I don’t want to be broken up with in emojis. But I think with sex there are things that are really hard to say and hard to ask for, and that’s such a beautiful window to be able to provide someone with language. I like the idea of Flirtmoji, but I’m not sold on the name yet. Why did you decided to call them that, instead of something like ""Sextmoji,"" for instance? I think sex is obvious, and we also wanted them to be available to people who aren’t having sex. You can be flirting, it doesn’t have to be about intercourse. If it’s not so serious to you, there are flirty icons. There’s stigma around sexting, so part of this project is light and funny. I think naming them around the word ""flirting"" keeps it there. The Daily Dot wrote about Flirtmoji this week and they did so in a way that wasn’t entirely positive. The writer said that they could be misinterpreted and used in negative ways.  As a result, your team wrote a blog post to explain how you translate Flirtmoji. Do you want to talk about that? I'm going to let our blog post speak for itself. But, essentially, we felt grateful for the press, but disappointed that the author interpreted the icons with such negativity and violence and strife, and put women in such a position of receiving said violence and aggression. We designed the icons to be straightforward. We don't agree with The Daily Dot's interpretation that the icons have hidden, secret messages that are aggressive and dangerous. That said, the way she described the icons reveals a truth that the user can misuse these Flirtmoji, but they can also use them for good and sext positively. The deciding factor lies with the user, but we like to think we set them up for success by creating positive, inclusive iconography. Accessing Flirtmoji is very different from accessing other types of emoji on a mobile device. They aren’t in the iTunes store, for instance, so you have to go in your phone’s internet browser and copy them into a text message, or save them to your phone's photo album. Did you try to be included in app stores? We never actually attempted to be included in the iTunes store. We did our research, and we were sort of disheartened by what we found. There’s this really beautiful design project called Geometric Porn that was kicked out of the iTunes store for being explicit, and it’s beautiful. It’s anatomical, it’s funny, and it’s sexy. It’s also literally triangles and circles and fleshy colored objects, so the fact that they were rejected really bummed us out. There’s a lot of violence and games that objectify women in the app store though, so on that level, I’m pretty stoked to not be part of it. I know we’re asking people to use their phones in a different way than they are used to. But this a tiny project from four kids who care, and who went around conventional app stores. We could have built an app, tried and gotten rejected, but instead we're just not part of that system, and I think that's really cool. Some of the emoji are free, and buying other collections costs $0.99. How has that worked out so far? That’s still something we’re trying to figure out. I don’t know if we can get people to use their phones in a way that they’re not familiar with and to give us money to do it. And also feels complex to charge money for it, except that I’m an artist and I’ve been doing this for a while and…  I just want people to see it. I want people to sext. I want people to have more candid conversations. It would be so rad if this caused people to have real, deep, hard conversations about sex and various kinks. I want that for everyone.",0.5400014797205597,0.4599985202794403,0.3173142928443749,1741,4.6668581275129233,686,6.2026239067055391,0,10,"Culture, Design, Tech, Interview"

There's the famous Oculus Rift, made of somber black plastic with thick foam padding. There's Samsung's white, bulbous Gear VR and Sony's glowing, Tron-like Project Morpheus. There's Google Cardboard and any number of other cheap paper eyepieces. But I've never tried on anything like the cartoonish pink box that is Cordon Media's Pinć. Pinć (pronounced ""pinch"") is a 3D-printed headset that looks neither gritty nor futuristic. It's a brightly-colored iPhone 6 case with what looks like a pair of flat swim goggles inside, held in place by a thin elastic band. And it's part of a platform for virtual reality that's less about escaping into an alternate world than taking a quick jaunt through one. ""We almost approached VR as an accessory,"" says creator Milan Baic. The Pinć prototype is only a couple of times thicker than the iPhone itself, and it's meant to be as non-threatening as a headset can be, at a price point that's not precisely a bargain but still less than the Oculus Rift or Gear VR.   Cordon is also targeting a group that's increasingly enamored of the technology: advertising teams. ""We really feel the next killer app for VR, outside of gaming, is mobile commerce,"" says Baic. Pinć comes with an app that, in mockup form, includes a video section, simple paint app, shopping portal, keyboard, photo gallery, and camera — the headset comes with a fisheye lens that gives the iPhone camera a wider field of view and allows for simple augmented reality tricks, like the floating whale that's shown on startup. Baic imagines people using their phones normally, then popping Pinć on to look at something up-close or avoid distractions. Theoretically, this would leave shoppers feeling like they have a better idea of what they're buying than they could get with an unmagnified screen. Motion-tracking lets you work bigger, but not faster The real thing that sets Pinć apart, though, is its unique input system: a pair of LED-studded rings that your phone's camera can track, replacing the usual finger taps or an external controller. The rings, worn on the forefingers, let you interact in a way that's reminiscent of the Leap Motion controller. But Baic says they're far less of a battery drain than a full motion-tracking system, because all the camera needs to do is find a few bright lights, not detect the edges of an entire hand. You make selections by clicking a tiny button on the underside of each ring, which flashes a signal light that your phone can read. This small, low-tech solution also lets the whole thing run without Bluetooth or other wireless technology. Cordon is launching a crowdfunding campaign for Pinć today, and it's accepting pre-orders through its website for $99 Canadian (around $90 US, which is less than half as much as the $200 Gear VR but nearly four times as much as Dodocase's $25 disposable cardboard goggles). Headsets are set to ship in the spring of 2015. Right now, it's still solidly in the development phase, but I tried out an early version of the hardware and software. The verdict? It's promising, but very, very rough.   My first impression of the Pinć was maddening pain. Where most headsets are essentially ski masks, this one uses free-floating lenses anchored by stretchy plastic bands. This lets the device fold into a neat, self-contained packet, but the eyepieces have a tendency to dig into the face, like tight swim goggles. Every time I blinked, they pressed my eyelashes into my eyes, forcing me to adjust them every few seconds or resort to squinting. This doesn't seem like a permanent predicament — another prototype, made a week later, included soft rubber wings and felt much more comfortable. But it shows that the ergonomics, one of the most important elements of a VR headset, are far from settled. The interface itself will probably be described as Minority Report-esque, but only insofar as it uses motion tracking. It's really a blown-up phone UI, down to the two-finger interactions that let you, say, pinch and zoom into a photo. Instead of using your thumbs to tap the screen, you click them against your forefingers like tiny castanets. There are plans for a full-featured browser, map tool, and other apps, and the whole thing will be reworked as a final version in the Unity engine. A software development kit is supposed to be released early next year.   Like the glasses, the motion control is a work in progress. I managed to get the hang of it over the course of five minutes, but hitting the small buttons required careful precision, and the camera couldn't read the LEDs unless my fingers were held at a perfectly square angle. You can see things on a much bigger scale than you could on your phone, examining pictures in detail or entering environments like a virtual showroom, but you won't be working nearly as fast.   Short of seeing a final, improved version, this isn't a product I'd recommend for anyone but hardcore VR early-adopters. It's a proof of concept that's out of impulse-buy range, and it won't give you measurable benefits if you just want to play games or watch Paul McCartney in concert. Despite these problems, Pinć is one of relatively few VR prototypes that doesn't seem like it's pushing up against an inherent, immediate limit. The ring-based tracking system is in some ways less frustrating than the more mature Leap Motion, which can lose track of where you are and send your virtual hand flying across the screen at inopportune moments. The goggles stand a chance of being the rare VR device that's genuinely portable — and even in a clearly unfinished state, they're more approachable-looking than most stuff on the market. It's not always pleasant, but Pinć is a device I can look at and think that yes, this could get better. I just hope it does.",0.5152856554296096,0.4847143445703904,0.1807358754485191,1013,4.8400789733464959,568,6.151408450704225,0,8,"Design, Mobile, Tech, Hands-on"

OTG Management, a company that runs airport restaurants, has been redesigning airport facilities around the country using Apple devices and custom software to make travel less hellish. Now the company is turning its attention to Newark Liberty International Airport — one of the busiest international hubs in the United States. Over the next 18 months OTG will install 6,000 iPads on tables, bars, and stations near waiting areas throughout United Airline’s terminal at Newark. Flashing your boarding pass in front of the iPad’s camera pulls up your United profile, with flight information, travel updates, and frequent flier miles. The program, which is opt-in, learns your preferences from your past purchases and recommends things it thinks you might want to buy. If you never buy the orange juice, it will start showing you other options; if you keep buying steak frites, it will show you steak sandwiches. ""This is the game changer for personalization,"" says Albert Lee, OTG’s chief technology officer. It’s a $120 million project that will bring 55 new restaurants to the facility, some quite high-end for an airport. There will be sushi, bahn mi, steak, dim sum, barbecue, a french brasserie, and a ramen pulling station beneath a metal mesh tower. All of them will use the iPad ordering system. Beneath the glitzy new hardware, OTG is using iOS to automate its restaurants’ workflows. When you buy something, OTG’s software, called Flo, sends the order directly to an iPad in the kitchen. You pay either with frequent flier miles or with a credit card, swiped at a reader on the table. When the order is up, the kitchen notifies a server through an iPod touch each employee carries. If an order doesn’t get picked up in a timely manner, the system pings the entire staff. ""We have accountability every step of the way to make this a much more efficient process,"" Lee says. As more elements of restaurant and retail work have been automated, it's created new opportunities for employee monitoring — if software is telling workers what tasks to do, it's easy for it to also tell someone whether those tasks have been done. Managers like it because it provides data on individual performance and creates pressure for employees to pitch customers harder. Of course, it also raises concerns about surveillance of employees. Lee says the system is a win-win: waiters can serve more tables and get more tips, while customers don’t have to wait to place an order or get a check. ""We think this will elevate the customer experience without requiring them to hire more people,"" Lee says. By automating all the order-taking and bill-delivering, Lee says, they’re allowing waiters to ""have one job and one job only: to keep the customer happy."" He says that though the system will allow waiters to manage twice as many tables, this doesn’t mean OTG will be hiring fewer workers. Instead, he says, workers will have more time to focus on hospitality. ""We don’t believe in full automation,"" Lee says. ""We believe it’s a hybrid of people and technology."" OTG developed its system for airports, where harried and baggage-laden travelers make speed and convenience paramount, but it’s a preview of what’s to come in the quickly growing fast-casual restaurant industry. Panera and Chili’s recently installed tablet menus, and Chipotle, Taco Bell, and other fast-food companies have dedicated apps for ordering pick-up. Across the industry the trend is toward automating everything but the actual cooking of food, making the purchasing process ""as frictionless as possible,"" as Lee says. Next year, OTG will roll out its Flo system commercially for restaurants outside of the airport. ""A funny thing happened along the way,"" says CEO Rick Blatstein. ""We became a technology company."" He says OTG is in talks with several fast-casual chains about adopting its system.   OTG started managing airport restaurants in 1996, but the company hit its stride after the introduction of the iPad, growing 70 percent since it first started using the devices in 2011. It now manages over 200 restaurants in 11 airports, including terminals in New York, Minneapolis, Chicago, and Philadelphia. With the United terminal, the company says it will become the largest deployer of customer-facing iPads in the world, using more iPads than Apple uses in its stores. Newark’s terminal will be the single largest deployment in the world and will bring the company’s total number of iPads to around 13,000. OTG also says passengers spend 43 percent more at its terminals than they do on average. They’ll have employees distributed throughout the airport who can pick up goods and bring them to you, directed by their iPod touches — for now. Lee says you can ""connect the dots"" and see the appeal of an Apple Watch for directing employees to the next task. OTG is also testing iBeacon, Apple’s Bluetooth Low Energy devices that can precisely locate smartphone users in buildings where GPS doesn’t work. Other airports have been experimenting with using iBeacon to send travel information to passengers and help them navigate the terminal. OTG would use them to dispatch employees to deliver goods throughout the airport. It would turn airports into automated shopping malls, where you sit at your gate and employees deliver your purchases to you.

Thanks to films like Frozen and Big Hero 6, the company is once again at the forefront of the industry.

And it's artists like Victoria Ying who are helping lead the charge. Her fascination started young with a love of comics — ""mostly anime girly stuff,"" she says — and slowly blossomed into a career after she studied illustration at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. Ying started at Disney relatively recently, so she's been able to see the studio's transformation first hand. ""I started at Disney Animation just as we were finishing with Princess and the Frog,"" she explains, ""and morale was quite low. It's been exciting to see the studio turn around and become a name once again in the animation world. It's been a real interesting time because there has been a unique infusion of young talent into the studio and excitement over the types of films we have been working on."" Outside of her work on films like Wreck-it Ralph and Paperman, Ying has also worked on several children's books, including Curiosities, which smashed through its $4,000 Kickstarter goal back in 2012, raising close to $50,000. A second crowdfunded project called Lovely did even better. ""I would love to continue doing this and working on my craft,"" she says of working on books. Like many modern artists, she uses a combination of Photoshop and a Cintiq tablet for most of her work — ""it helps me get to a final piece very quickly"" — but she also dabbles in everything from watercolors to pencils. Ying's work is fueled by an addiction to podcasts and sitcoms that play in the background while she paints and draws.

Free same-day delivery will only be available for around one million items (compared to the 20 million covered by free two-day delivery), and is limited to 14 metropolitan areas, together covering a sixth of the US population. Orders also need to be over $35 and placed before noon to be eligible. Amazon says the ability to offer free, same-day shipments is thanks to investment in its fulfillment centers — facilities that combine the functionality of warehouses and delivery hubs. ""We can get items closer to customers, get more items in stock and be able to deliver as quickly as possible,"" Chris Rupp, vice president of Amazon Prime, told CNET. Amazon Prime is estimated to have 30 million to 40 million customers in the US Although the company doesn't release statistics for how many Prime members have signed up, analysts estimate that the figure is somewhere between 30 million and 40 million in the US, with an additional 40 million to 50 million members worldwide. Some researchers even predict that half of the US population could be signed up by 2020, each paying Amazon's annual $99 subscription fee for free access to music and video streaming, as well as speedy deliveries. The company continues to add new perks to Prime, offering one-hour deliveries in certain locations (though these cost extra) and expanding to deliver groceries and baked goods from third-party stores.

Japan’s most respected business newspaper, the Nikkei Shimbun, today raised the possibility that Nintendo’s mysterious upcoming system — codenamed NX — may be based on Google’s Android operating system. The report is curiously sourced to a single anonymous insider, and takes the form of a column, not a typical news story; moreover, the Nikkei has a spotty record with Nintendo in particular.  But that doesn’t make the proposition any less fascinating, and it’s one I’ve been considering myself for some time. Although it would be an unusual move for the Japanese giant, which is famously hesitant to cede control over any aspect of its products, there are a lot of reasons why it might make sense — and why it wouldn’t contradict Nintendo’s own philosophy. The most obvious reason for Nintendo to use Android as a starting point is that it would give the company a considerable leg up toward having its own credible, modern operating system. Anyone who’s used a Wii U will know how far behind Nintendo is in this area; the software is inexplicably slow, even after multiple updates and workarounds, and despite its tablet-focused approach, it doesn’t offer anywhere near the functionality of the most basic Android mobile devices. Nintendo is arguably the best developer in the world when it comes to making video games, but like many of its Japanese contemporaries, has failed to adapt to a world where software platforms are now paramount. Android is the most-used operating system in the world today, and the parts of it most important and useful to Nintendo would be available for free. Whatever your thoughts on the Android operating system itself, they wouldn’t be likely to have much bearing on any Nintendo implementation. The company's philosophy is to create unique console hardware as a canvas for its talent, and a move to Android at the system level wouldn’t lead to, say, Nintendo releasing its top-tier titles straight to the Google Play store for anyone to download, or relying on Google for media services. President and CEO Satoru Iwata has made it clear that the recent alliance with mobile gaming company DeNA is designed to drive interest in Nintendo’s dedicated systems, and announced NX the same day as the DeNA deal to push home the point. So I would expect a Nintendo Android console to run a much more dramatic fork of the OS than something like Nvidia’s gaming-focused Shield devices, which have access to the Play store and other Google-powered functionality. Nintendo could build its own user-facing layer, along the lines of Xiaomi and Amazon’s Android-based operating systems, while remaining in complete control over what software sees release. There’s no reason why Nintendo couldn’t include quirky, original features like Miiverse or StreetPass on this hypothetical system. But Nintendo ultimately wants more software on its platforms, having struggled to attract third-party content ever since the N64 in the ‘90s, and an Android-based NX could prove more appealing to developers than the often-awkward proprietary hardware. Although Amazon’s devices run Android at their core and should be easily compatible with most Android apps, some developers have decided against the seemingly simple task; the lack of built-in Google services means many apps have to implement Amazon’s own replacement APIs, which can be non-trivial. Many games and media services, however, only really need to run their own content, meaning that in theory there’d be fewer obstacles to getting them up and running on the NX. Nintendo would have to do some legwork, for sure, but a gaming-focused Android OS could afford to be less complex than a phone. Android compatibility could benefit developers inside and outside Nintendo And Android compatibility could benefit developers inside Nintendo as well. Iwata has long spoken of the need for Nintendo to better integrate its home consoles and handheld devices, and said early last year that the two teams were merged because technology had advanced to the point where both form factors could use the same architecture. The shared technology would let users run the same games at home and on the go, and allow for multiple form factors. Iwata implied that the next system could retain some similarity to the Wii U in order to speed up its development; Nintendo’s latest home console runs on PowerPC architecture not known for its mobile friendliness, but Iwata allowed that a successor would simply need to ""absorb the Wii U architecture adequately."" However, given that system’s eventual resounding failure and Nintendo’s spectacular about-face on the issue of mobile, it’s just as easy to see the company deciding to work with a hardware partner on an ARM or x86 processor and using the widespread Android codebase as a different yet equally simple path. By the time NX is available, which I would expect to be well over 18 months away, ARM processors will routinely match and outstrip the power of the Wii U, making them more than suitable for the type of games Nintendo makes. Intel has made gains with x86 on Android, too, and would be worth considering. I can’t say whether there’s any truth to this report or not, but I do think Nintendo could make it work. Imagine a suite of devices from set-top box to tablet to gaming handheld, all with input options designed by Nintendo. Each would run Nintendo’s own speedy operating system, yet would have access to countless compatible Android games and media apps. And each would play premium Nintendo games created specifically for the hardware and released nowhere else. (Heck, each could even play premium third-party games, too, in the implausible event that publishers would like to return to Nintendo platforms.) In this scenario, Nintendo could preside over an ecosystem it controls while providing an easy path for others to join — all without compromising on what people have come to expect from modern hardware. Who wouldn’t want to buy into that? The days of Nintendo’s proprietary advantages are long gone, but in helping to democratize the design of computing devices, Android might just offer the unlikely assistance Nintendo needs to return to the summit of relevance.",0.6528345744181847,0.3471654255818153,0.7111438327655759,1030,5.1815533980582522,508,6.3444881889763778,0,8,"Business, Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Google, Tech, Editorial"

""What?"" you ask. ""That's been a thing since 2010."" Yes, I say back to you. Yet here we are in 2015 and here comes a new thing called Android Pay. It lets you pay for things at wireless payment terminals using NFC, but it's also been designed to work within apps so that your payment credentials can follow you around. Google's own showcasing of this here at its annual developers conference in San Francisco was just about as limited as when Apple introduced its own payments service (Apple Pay) last year. There are two things you can try to buy with a test phone: a bottle of soda and small, themed Android figurines, purchased from inside of shopping app Wish. I obviously went for the chemical bomb that is a 20-ounce bottle of cola. Doing that required pressing an unlocked phone up to an NFC terminal. I didn't know their code, so they had to unlock the phone then handed it over to me. I held it timidly toward the NFC reader, and it made a little beep. A small screen on the machine let me know I'd paid in full and with which credit card (it was an American Express), so I hit a button on the front, and caffeine dropped down with a satisfying thud.   The other test felt less viscerally exciting. I went to a special Google I/O-themed page of shopping app Wish, and paid for everything with someone else's Android Pay credentials. The checkout information was already filled out for me, I only had to tap an on-screen button once. There was no fingerprint needed, just like using Google Wallet. You realize you're still just buying small things That's really the thing with Android Pay: even nice features like hiding your payment credentials from vendors, and getting to use a rewards card membership at the same time, ends up feeling just like the system it's emulating. You're still just buying things. But that experience won't seem so painfully familiar forever, at least if Google has its way. Google's plans to integrate fingerprint sensors into the next version of Android, Android M. Some phones like Motorola's Atrix, Samsung's Galaxy S5, S6, and Note 4 smartphones already shipped out with readers.

The studios named in the EU Commission's Statement of Objections are Disney, NBCUniversal, Paramount Pictures, Sony, Twentieth Century Fox, and Warner Bros. The Commission says that when Sky UK, a British pay-TV company, licenses films from these studios, it's required to geo-block access to this content outside of Ireland and the UK, restricting European citizens' access. Clauses within some of these agreements also stop other broadcasters licensing the same content in the same countries, further stifling competition, according to the EU. The EU wants to make digital content accessible across European borders ""The Commission's preliminary conclusion is that [these] clauses would constitute a serious violation of EU rules that prohibit anticompetitive agreement,"" said the EU in a press release. This Statement of Objections is the first step in a full antitrust suit, but will require a response from the companies named before it continues.

In a decision handed down Thursday night, the Constitutional Council ruled that all but three of the bill's provisions are in line with the French constitution, allowing the law to go into effect despite vehement opposition from civil liberties groups. The bill, which was passed by France's parliament in May, allows the government to monitor the phone calls and emails of suspected terrorists without prior authorization from a judge. It also calls for internet service providers to install so-called black boxes that sweep up and analyze metadata on millions of web users, and forces them to make that data freely available to intelligence organizations. Intelligence agents will be able to plant microphones, cameras, and keystroke loggers in the homes of suspected terrorists. ""wildly out of proportion."" Prime Minister Manuel Valls has championed the measures as essential to defending France against terrorism, though civil rights groups say the law gives disproportionate power to the government. Under the law, the government can authorize surveillance for vaguely defined reasons such as ""major foreign policy interests"" and preventing ""organized delinquency."" The UN Human Rights Council expressed concern over the law earlier this week, saying it lacks sufficient oversight. The bill was pushed through after armed gunmen orchestrated a string of attacks that began at the Paris offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January. It faced little political opposition, but was roundly criticized by French web hosting companies and international privacy groups, who compared it to the US Patriot Act. French President François Hollande asked the Constitutional Council to review the bill after it was definitively approved in June, marking the first time that a president has deferred to the courts before allowing a law to go into effect. On Thursday, the council struck down three of the law's provisions, including one that would have allowed the government to intercept any communications sent or received overseas. Another rejected provision would have allowed intelligence services to carry out surveillance without authorization from the prime minister when faced with ""urgent threats.""   #LoiRenseignement: la France a désormais un cadre sécurisé contre le terrorisme et respectueux des libertés.

The referral was filed by two inspectors general, though the Justice Department has not decided whether it will launch an investigation. The latest characterization of the DOJ's action disputes a New York Times report from earlier today that said the inspectors had requested a criminal investigation. The referral comes amid an ongoing State Department review of Clinton's private email account, which she used for government business during her four years as secretary of state under the Obama administration. Clinton has said that she used the account (and the private server that hosted it) as ""a matter of convenience,"" though it also exempted her from some federal transparency obligations. Revelations about the account have raised concerns over the transparency and security of Clinton's correspondence, sparking controversy as her 2016 presidential campaign kicks into gear. ""Hundreds of potentially classified emails."" Clinton has maintained that the account contained no classified information, though in a June 29th memo obtained by the Times, inspectors general for the State Department and intelligence agencies said the account included ""hundreds of potentially classified emails."" The State Department is currently reviewing 55,000 pages of Clinton's emails, after having released the first 3,000 pages to the public on June 30th. It's yet not clear whether any of the sensitive information was classified at the time, though officials have determined that some of the emails should be retroactively classified. In a June 17th memo, also obtained by the Times, the inspectors general wrote that at least one of the emails made public contained classified information. The memo also criticizes the State Department for the way it handled sensitive information on Clinton's account, noting that it did not consult with intelligence agencies to determine which emails should be classified. A federal judge this week raised concerns over the State Department's failure to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests from the Associated Press, saying that it ""has been, to say the least, recalcitrant in responding.""

After being handed the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard award by benevolent monarch Taylor Swift — a neat flip of their interaction on the same stage six years ago, when West stormed up to defend Beyoncé’s work at Swift’s expense — West spoke at length about celebrity, media hypocrisy, artistry, fatherhood, and the future. He capped off the speech by acknowledging he’d smoked a little something ""to take the edge off,"" announcing he’s going to run for president in 2020, and dropping the mic. And despite host Miley Cyrus’ best efforts — a parade of dancing drag queens! A phallic glitter cannon! A surprise album! — no remaining part of the telecast could generate the kind of electricity Kanye created the minute he came on stage. There’s obviously a ton to plumb here, Micah — that’s what happens when you give one of pop music’s boldest, brightest figures carte blanche with a microphone and a joint. Let’s get straight to the elephant in the recap, so to speak: do you think Kanye is actually going to run for president in five years? Micah Singleton: I don’t think so. I mean, it would be the greatest thing ever to happen in politics, but I seriously doubt Kanye actually wants to run the United States. I think he’s hellbent on conquering the fashion world as he did the music industry, and it’s going to take time before he’s mentioned in the same company as someone like his idol Ralph Lauren. These days, it seems like Kanye’s main desire is to remove the restraints on artistic (and general) freedom and to rid our society of the preconceived notions and #brands that influence our youth (even though he himself is a #brand and married into an even bigger #brand). He wants the next generation to aspire to be greater than even they would consider, which is likely why he said he’s running for president. But will he run and unseat President Trump? No matter how much I want it to happen, I doubt it. You don’t announce a presidential campaign with a mic drop. JC: Yeah, I don’t think so either. To me, it felt like the kind of thing someone says when they’re excited and a little inebriated and looking to go out with a bang. It made everyone in the room lose their minds, and it ensured that every news organization under the sun — even ones without a vested interest in entertainment — would cover his remarks in some capacity. Unfortunately, it also probably compromised the impact of his more precise and cogent points about celebrity and media. Most people are either joking about the concept of a Kanye presidency, seriously considering the feasibility of a run, or dismissing everything he had to say out of hand. I know it’s a lot of fun to play with, but I’d like to move on from the idea of a Kardashian-West White House. What was your favorite part of the speech? There's still a lot of work to do on racial relations in this country MS: When he spoke about the Sunday night in 2009 when he took the mic from Taylor Swift. He mentioned going to the grocery store with North and talking to other shoppers who ultimately realize he isn’t the raging asshole much of the press has made him out to be over the years. That night in 2009 had a profound effect on our society. The immense outpouring of hatred was one of the first major moments in our post-Obama America that showed we still have a long way to go before racial relations in this country can truly be fixed. What Kanye did was stupid without a doubt, but he didn’t deserve the kind of backlash he received. To hear that, six years later, he still gets joy from converting one person away from being a Kanye hater was endearing. I think it humanized him a bit. What was your favorite part of Kanye’s speech? JC: My favorite part of the speech — or the part I thought was most interesting, rather — was what Kanye had to say about artistry: defending it, rewarding it, empowering it. I think he touched on something close to his core when he said, ""I’ve been conflicted, bro! I just wanted people to like me more."" This is the conflict at his heart: he’s a renegade and a visionary, sure, but he’s also a populist. He wants to fight for what he believes — whether it’s Beyoncé having the best video of all time or Justin Timberlake making the best album of the year or, hell, George Bush not caring about black people — but he can’t reconcile that desire with his desire not to do harm. He makes boundary-pushing, avant-garde music, but he can’t help but spike his most challenging music with bits of radiant melody. (Think of the passage that closes ""New Slaves,"" or the placement of ""Bound 2"" at the end of Yeezus.)  I think it’s worth evaluating some of Kanye’s other comments and prevailing attitudes through this lens. He may not understand award shows, but it’s obvious he cares intensely about them — more than any other artist working, I’d say. That’s because he views them as vehicles for the popular recognition of his work, and he can’t keep himself from wanting that. It doesn’t matter if the Grammys are representative of an old white people cabal, or if the VMAs are instruments of advertising dollars and nothing else: Kanye grants them with meaning, imbues them with the voice of the people. And as for Kanye having ""died for the artist’s opinion,"" I think that’s the one statement where he crossed into self-aggrandizement — Sinead O’Connor ripped up a picture of the Pope and asked people to ""fight the real enemy"" a decade-plus before Kanye dropped The College Dropout, if you want to talk about artists fighting for the right to self-expression. But I think his expression of minor martyrdom fits into the idea I’ve laid out above. It’s why Kanye’s so rankled by being painted as a villain all the time: he’s the hero of his story, one in which he took a hit so that others artists gained the freedom to speak their minds. All of us can say the same, right? There’s something else I want to pick your brain about. Do you think it’s notable that Kanye didn’t mention his music or visual style whatsoever while speaking? I’m a little surprised — taken together, they’re the reasons he was receiving this award in the first place! Kanye has guided popular music for the last decade, if not longer MS: I was surprised he didn’t perform, but then again I don’t think he needed to. He’s arguably the most popular celebrity in the world. At this point there’s nothing left to say. He’s one of the top five hip-hop producers of all time without question and arguably one of the five greatest hip-hop artists. He produced The Blueprint. He’s the reason gangster rap isn’t popular anymore. He’s a reason EDM went from underground clubs to the mainstream (see: ""Stronger""). His work on 808s and Heartbreak paved the way for the sonic and lyrical work of Drake and The Weeknd. Kanye West has been the guiding hand behind popular music for the last decade, if not longer. When you’re that good, you really don’t need to talk about how you come up with music video concepts. JC: I agree that Kanye has nothing to prove, but I’m also surprised he didn’t perform — especially given the awards’ recent history. We know Kanye has tremendous respect for Beyoncé and Justin Timberlake, both of whom put together summative performances for the show. Why didn’t he attempt to create the same sort of musical moment? I think the answer’s pretty simple: he’s just not that interested in music right now. It doesn’t help that the songs he’s released from the upcoming Swish haven’t exactly set the world on fire. Perhaps there’s a parallel universe where ""All Day"" soared into the top 10 and gave him a shot of musical energy, but that certainly wasn’t the case in this one.  Before we close out, I want to hear from you regarding Kanye’s position in contemporary celebrity culture — first as a commentator, and then as a participant. Let’s start with the first: what do you think of Kanye’s read on celebrity and the media as expressed through the speech? He had some pointed things to say about public opinion and the specific hypocrisy of MTV. MS: American society has adopted the unrelenting habit of building celebrities and public figures up only to tear them down (it’s been going on for ages, but modern media has perfected it).  He was chastised for the Taylor Swift fiasco, but he’s also right that MTV promoted Swift presenting him with his award all week in the lead up to the VMAs to boost ratings. And when Kanye says he ""doesn’t understand"" award shows, he’s talking about the incessant need to appoint a ""winner"" within a group of people who are already living their dreams and didn’t sign up for a sporting event. The ""somebody must be the best"" approach we as a society take with celebrities is completely contradictory to the ""everybody gets a trophy"" approach we take with our children. But despite Kanye’s pleas, award shows aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. If MTV — a network that hasn’t shown a music video in 10 years — can’t continue to hold the preeminent music video award show, then America is a lie. How does Kanye fit into today's celebrity landscape? JC: I’m also curious about where you think Kanye fits into today’s celebrity landscape. It’s hard to believe — for me, anyway — but he’s 38 years old, a full decade and a half older than someone Miley’s age. Watching him talk about creativity and millennials and the Grammy Awards, I really started to feel that age gap. Do you think Kanye came off dated at all once the speech was finished? How does he fit into a celebrity climate that devalues so many of the qualities he holds dear: authenticity, artistry, uncompromising honesty? MS: Millennials don’t like to be put into boxes, and that mindset is the biggest thing Kanye West preaches, and practices. Even though he’s not officially a millennial, Kanye is one of our top artistic figures and one of the most influential people young people have today. He told a paparazzo he had nice shoes, and then they sold out. It wasn’t baby boomers buying those shoes. Kanye’s influence is undeniable on anybody that grew up with his music. More than any other generation, millennials are dreamers who will go out, push social norms, and attempt to make that dream a reality. They aren’t afraid of change, and they're willing to put the work in to reach their goals. Even if it means living in their parent’s house. And that’s completely in tune with everything Kanye West is about.",0.6470934622460076,0.3529065377539924,0.16640065577591098,1887,4.7244303126656071,855,6.1532163742690056,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Music, VMA 2015 "

An update to the company's mobile video apps for each platform — now renamed ""Amazon Video"" — lets Prime subscribers download the service's streaming titles for viewing, just as customers had been able to do on Amazon's line of Fire devices. The change takes one of the biggest inconveniences of streaming services and removes it from the equation entirely. Now, if you're in the middle of binging Downton Abbey and need to jump on a plane, you won't have to go without; you'll be able to download a number of episodes and take the Crawleys with you.  A shot across the bow of Netflix As part of the update, the company is also dropping the clunky ""instant"" from the name of its subscription streaming service, which will now just be known as Amazon Prime Video. The downloading feature is a clear shot across the bow of Netflix, which last year emphatically stated that it would never add offline playback. Why Netflix has held such a hardline stance has been a little unclear, but the reasons are no doubt varied. The licensing agreements the company strikes would need to incorporate the option of offline playback — studios would likely want to be compensated for revenue they could lose from travel-related movie rentals and sales — and Netflix's own infrastructure has been designed around the concept of streaming, rather than widespread downloads. Amazon, on the other hand, already has an appropriate infrastructure in place for those buying movies, and has proven to be quite aggressive when it comes to licensing. That said, for now only a subset of Prime Video titles will be available for offline playback, including (of course) Amazon's original shows like Transparent and Bosch, and programs coming from the exclusive licensing agreements the company has recently struck with the likes of NBCUniversal (Hannibal), CBS (Under the Dome), and Fox (24). Amazon is highlighting several movies as well, including Star Trek Into Darkness and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. If those names sound familiar, that's because they're some of the many movies that Netflix is set to lose as its deal with Epix draws to a close at the end of September.

I mean, everything's a setup in some way; gathering hundreds of the most followed people on Twitter under the hallowed roof of something called the Microsoft Theater is a setup within a setup, a canvas upon which countless profitable setups can be executed. On first glance, Viacom giving Miley Cyrus carte blanche on live TV for three hours seems like a gift, a cynical holiday bonus from a company whose dwindling relevance was temporarily decelerated in 2013 by her headline-grabbing twerk-like gestures and tongue gymnastics. But it's not as if MTV's parent company Viacom had nothing to gain from the transaction. Through Miley they could promise a night of extreme FCC button-pushing; she could be a mascot for a web-art damaged brand of internet-era irreverence that would make them look ""dope"" and ""edgy"" without being ""too weird"" or ""not GIF-able."" And in return, Miley would be given the stage on which to light her own career on fire.    ""You made it about you."" She set the groundwork for this days before the show, when she sat down for an interview with The New York Times to promote the awards show. The conversation came to the recent Twitter exchange between Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj, and Nicki's claim that the VMAs were quicker to reward female artists of a certain race (white) and a certain body type (model-thin). Swift read that general, completely valid criticism as a personal attack on her and her 2015 Video of the Year award-winning ""Bad Blood"" video; anyone who's been watching Miley closely for the past few years could easily predict that, if asked, she would read it as a direct attack on her and her 2014 Video of the Year award-winning ""Wrecking Ball"" video. ""It’s not anger like, 'Guys, I’m frustrated about some things that are a bigger issue,'"" Cyrus said. ""You made it about you. Not to sound like a bitch, but that’s like, 'Eh, I didn’t get my V.M.A.'"" here's a goddamned rant if i ever saw one pic.twitter.com/X460MiL5HJ It's not the greatest form of all time to editorialize about any nominees in an awards show you're about to host, no matter how crazy and unpredictable a reputation that awards show needs to uphold. 1But anyone could have predicted that Miley would take the bait. Because, of course, ""I'm frustrated about some things that are a bigger issue"" is exactly how Minaj has framed her argument all along. ""Making it about you,"" meanwhile, is something that Miley Cyrus (and Taylor Swift) have been excelling at for years. And this was the setup for Nicki's show-stopping call-out during her acceptance speech for her Best Hip-Hop Video award, a moment that put Miley on the defensive for the rest of the night. However orchestrated that moment may have been, it made Nicki look righteous, and Miley look woefully out of touch, sputtering in her defense (""we all say things in the press,"") from underneath a neon visor as two giant eyeballs drooped off of her breasts. She looked like the rich girl whose birthday party everyone’s parents forced them to go to, if that girl was also wearing white dreadlocks while defending herself from being implicated in systemic pop cultural racism. Here's where I have to say that the ""approach things from a place of love"" counterargument is the most privileged counterargument ever devised in Faux Hippy Rhetoric 101. Sunday night was a vivid reminder that Miley was brought up to be a child star. She almost can't help but suck up all the oxygen in the room like her very life depended on it. No matter how much molly she dances with, she will never quite shake that mugging, ""hiya folks!"" Disney-trained screen presence. She doesn't know how to cede the spotlight to the other performers on the bill, which is literally the job description of an emcee or host. I suspect MTV knew this even as they placed her front and center for every VMA promo they ran. But they had to get Miley in there somehow; she's been a reliable centerpiece of their past two VMAs, and after a year of relative radio silence (save for the occasional glitter-covered half-naked Instagram pic with Wayne Coyne) with no extant new music to promote or videos to throw moonmen at, there had to be some way to get her on screen. In that endeavor, at the very least, MTV and Miley were wildly successful. You know how sometimes you've got a refreshingly funny, appealing host on an awards show (your Tina Feys and Amy Poehlers, your Chris Rocks) and about halfway through the show you're like, ""Hey, where'd so-and-so-go?"" That was not a problem we had with Miley Cyrus at the VMAs. In a show where several major awards were given out on the red carpet, we somehow had time for an endless parade of unfunny skits with Snoop Dogg and Mike Will Made It, attention-starved costume changes, and pot jokes — lots and lots of pot jokes. (Miley is to black men as Taylor Swift is to other women — you can team up with her for a bit, but make no mistake, that bit will never be about anyone other than her.) In the end, with her raspy shout and her undying desperation to prove she was still edgy and crazy, Miley came off as more of a cool mom than a youth culture avatar. Her hosting persona, with its vaudevillian thirstiness and orchestrated nip slips, reminded me of Mama Bazoom from Showgirls, which should be a compliment but somehow is not. The real death knell for Miley came after Kanye West's rousing, stream-of-consciousness acceptance speech for the Video Vanguard award. It was a speech that one-upped Fiona Apple's famous ""this world is bullshit"" 1997 VMA acceptance speech, and questioned the very concept of awards shows and MTV's motives in creating the kinds of moments the VMAs are known for. Kanye undercut himself by capping off the profoundly candid with the outrageous because that's just how Kanye operates, it still felt genuinely thrilling, an increasingly rare instance in which an outspoken, yes-kinda-stoned artist tried his best to speak to the giant machine we were all operating in, whether we were in the theater or on our couches struggling to come up with funny tweets. Up until the presidency thing, it was a pretty ego-less moment, as Kanye moments go. The show could have ended after he dropped the mic. It had reached a peak that I don't think anyone was expecting when they first tuned into that evening's mostly dismal proceedings. But the first voice to cut through the roar of applause was Miley, wearing some kind of oversized sparkly coat, gushing about how crazy Kanye was, how much he made her laugh, as if he was a child or a YouTube star. I think she followed that up with another pot joke. Only someone completely blinded to anything outside herself can misread a moment to that degree. By the time Miley was shouting ""yeah, I smoke pot"" in her finale number as dozens of drag queens gyrated around her (another year, another minority group to glom onto and fill out your shell of a personal identity with!), she felt as irrelevant as the post-credits bumper for whatever scripted MTV show is on tonight that you've already forgotten the name of. And that's when I really started to wonder: had she been set up? Sure, she embarrassed herself all on her own, but she was given a tremendous stage on which to do so, and nobody seemed to be interested in stopping her from diving off. But why would MTV do that to Miley? The better question is why wouldn't they. She's releasing unlistenable SoundCloud albums with Coyne without her label's cooperation. She's not going to be on the radio. MTV doesn't need anything from her. If they wanted to sacrifice a career live on air for the sake of ratings — or, if you want to give them that much credit, to make a point about white privilege — who more high profile and expendable than Miley? It's not even unprecedented: like Britney Spears before her, MTV made Miley, and at the VMAs they unmade her just as easily. And who knows, in four years, she could be our new Bieber, flying and crying and begging to be let back into the celebrity economy. That is, if the VMAs — or Miley's career — still exist.

Since its original launch, the Nest Thermostat has undergone two hardware revisions, with the most recent coming out just a couple of weeks ago. The third-generation Nest Thermostat is very similar to its predecessors, though it now has 40 percent larger display with 25 percent more resolution. It's still a round, hockey puck-like device that mounts in the same location as a traditional thermostat and connects to your Wi-Fi network. It still monitors your activity and adjusts itself accordingly, ostensibly saving money on wasted energy for heating and cooling when you're not home. And of course, you can control it from wherever you are with Nest's smartphone app.  The bigger display is easier to read from across the room, and you can have it automatically display the system's target temperature or a basic clock. It will wake up when you approach it automatically. If you already have one of Nest's earlier models, it's probably not worth spending the $249 it costs for the new one, but new customers will appreciate the improvements. I've recently installed the new Nest Thermostat in my home,  and will be using it to control my heating system. (My home was built in the 1940s and lacks centralized cooling, so the Nest can only control my forced-air, oil-burning furnace.) It's still quite warm here in the northeastern United States, so for now, the Nest is a pretty decoration on my wall until heating season arrives. Installing the Nest was shockingly easy — it was simpler than replacing a lighting fixture. A lot of that has to do with my home's very simple heating system: all I had to do was drill the mounting plate into the wall and connect two wires. It took longer for the Nest to update its firmware after I plugged it in and got it on my Wi-Fi network than it did to actually install the device on my wall. (As my home is quite a few decades old, it's had a number of different thermostats, and the scarring on the wall from those earlier models isn't fully obscured by the Nest's mounting plate. Looks like I have some painting to do.) Nest claims that the thermostat can save up to 10 percent on heating costs, so I plan to put it to the test once the true heating season starts.

But that requires a lot more thought than simply putting a chip in something and calling it ""smart."" Yet for all its excess, sometimes the Internet of Things gets it right. I’ve accumulated a number of smart objects over the years. Some with the explicit intent of solving a problem, others out of professional curiosity. My Toon LCD thermostat from Dutch energy provider Eneco fits in the first category, acquired a few years ago to give me real-time insight into my daily energy consumption. My Philips Hue lights fit into the latter, weirdly popular bulbs I bought because it’s fun to automatically turn your lights purple when it’s about to rain.  Yesterday I fired up my thermostat after being out of the house for six months due to a renovation. After a quick software update, I was greeted with a faster, nicer looking UI that asked me if I wanted to add my Hue lights. Wha? Never before had I thought, ""wouldn’t it be nice if my thermostat was integrated with my lights."" But then it hit me as I stared at the message on Toon’s 7-inch touchscreen: that big LCD would make a perfect lighting hub. Now my intelligent thermostat is also a centralized panel from which my family can control the home lighting — no smartphones required. Now that's smart. Toon, like Hue, ships with a ZigBee wireless chip. That’s the same silicon you’ll find in Nest and even Google’s new OnHub router, in addition to hundreds of home automation devices that have been around for years. But the ZigBee chips found in the new generation of smart devices can often lie dormant (as was the case with Nest and now OnHub) while companies wait for their own product lines (and those of others) to mature. Sometimes you just get lucky. The promise of IoT is real —  we just need more examples like my own to cut through the hype. The contrasts between the original Star Wars trilogy and its prequels were stark. Where Episodes IV to VI were told economically, the prequels felt bloated. Where the originals used practical effects, puppets, and people to build its galaxy, the prequels leaned on computer effects to make a universe that felt fake. Where A New Hope introduced characters we wanted to root for, The Phantom Menace featured a cast of punchable irritants, led by a character so annoying his name is shorthand for ""the worst.""

SpaceX's new Crew Dragon capsule may be reserved for astronauts traveling to and from the International Space Station — but now you can take a virtual tour of the vehicle's insides.

The images offer our first glimpse at what the finished Crew Dragon will look like.

Instead, it was an apparently serious opinion piece published earlier today on the news site Quartz.

The authors argue that humans should hunt and kill predators in order to save prey animals from dying horrible deaths.

No winning streak goes on forever. But it would be hard to tell that from this week’s announcements from Apple. Even though the latest iteration of the company’s main product, the iPhone, didn’t change much externally, its gigantic annual fall product intro event seemed jammed with new products, features, and clever ideas. Read next: The Apple iPhone 6S review. From a gargantuan iPad to a new Apple TV, to the new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, there was plenty of hardware. But, perhaps even more interesting, at least to me, were some small, clever software innovations that made navigating such devices easier. This hardly means Apple is perfect. Its new Apple Music service is confusing; its cloud products stumble too often; its Apple Watch still has a lot to prove; and, in my opinion, the company needs to take a fresh, hard look at core apps like Mail and Calendar. Apple remains the world’s most influential tech company But this week’s event convinced me that Apple remains the world’s most influential tech company — even as we approach next month's fourth anniversary of the tragically early death of its genius leader, Steve Jobs. Many people love Apple, others despise it. But, even without Jobs, it cannot be ignored. There simply is no other company which combines such a high-quality hardware line with such well-regarded software platforms. A faltering Samsung has the former, but not the latter. A strong and admirable Google has the latter, but not the former. If you didn’t believe that before, this week’s event made it crystal clear, with once-bitter rivals like Microsoft and Adobe showing up on stage to boast about how well their products worked with new Apple hardware and software. Neither I nor my fellow reviewers at The Verge have had a chance to truly put Apple’s new hardware and software through its paces; those reviews will be along in the coming weeks. But here are a few initial thoughts: 3D Touch is impressive • Anyone who thought there was no more fundamental innovation to be wrung out of the smartphone is just wrong. The 10-finger multi-touch interface made mainstream by the iPhone 8 years ago has now taken a leap forward with Apple’s 3D Touch. This lets you view content in apps without opening them, quickly perform common actions, and generally manage your smartphone more smoothly by simply pressing a bit harder than usual on the screen. In brief use so far, I found this both highly useful and delightful — exactly the reactions Apple loves best. I expect to use it many times a day. • Apple has upped its direct competition with the phone carriers by starting its own version of  their new unsubsidized, hardware installment payment plans. The decline of subsidies threatened to emphasize Apple’s (and Samsung’s) high prices. Instead, Apple countered by launching its own installment plan, which includes a warranty. It not only makes the iPhone seem more affordable, and encourages annual upgrades, it’s a weapon against carrier power, since the phones it will sell are unlocked, allowing people to switch networks at will. Siri has quietly gotten vastly better • Voice control can do more than ever. Siri, Apple’s voice-controlled intelligent assistant, now can control your TV. Once the butt of jokes because it erred too often, Siri has quietly gotten vastly better, and, with the new Apple TV, it shows astounding versatility. Other set-top boxes, including those from Roku, Amazon, and Comcast, already use voice to find shows and actors. But Siri in the new Apple TV can instantly answer questions like ""Who directed this movie""? And if you ask, ""What did he just say?"" it’ll rewind 15 seconds so you can hear the missed line again. Siri on Apple TV worked as promised for me almost every time even in a noisy demo area. • The war for the living room is on. Rumors about Apple revolutionizing TV are long in the tooth, but the new set-top box is like an opening gun for the company’s real ambition — providing its own TV service to compete with cable. I have no idea what this will look like, but, by introducing a powerful, fast box open to outside developers, the company has launched a campaign to turn TV and movie delivery into a series of apps that can help it keep people on Planet Apple. By turning the modest Apple TV into a potent, sexy hardware and software platform loaded with apps and games, the company might even be able to increase its leverage with media companies that have been resisting its ideas about content distribution. • Apple is willing to copy Microsoft to rescue the iPad. Its new iPad Pro tablet, like Microsoft’s Surface, has a magnetically connected snap-on keyboard and a stylus. Steven Sinofsky, the former Microsoft executive who helped create the Surface, tweeted: ""iPad Pro has a magnetic fold-out keyboard...What an awesome idea!!""  (But Apple hasn’t loaded it down with two user interfaces and a PC operating system, like its rival did.) This new tablet is a crucial part of the Cook-inspired plan to save the flagging iPad by driving it deeper into the Fortune 500 with a new form factor, productivity add-ons, and distribution deals with IBM and Cisco. The flow of ideas from Apple is still strong I have no idea how well these latest products will sell. And I care nothing at all for what Wall Street thinks of them. But I think they show that the flow of ideas from Apple is still strong. Even in years when Apple isn’t taking the really big swings, like an entirely new product category or service, its control over the levers of both hardware and software allow it to iterate in more meaningful and important ways than anyone else.

They were exceptional cameras, even with a handful of notable flaws. Then, last year, the company announced a more video-minded version with the A7s, which could shoot 4K video and had truly unbelievable low light performance. Now, Sony is building on that with the brand new A7s II. The first new feature you notice about the A7s II is 5-axis image stabilization. Sony made waves when it added 5-axis stabilization to the A7 II back in November, making it the first full-frame camera with such a feature. But it makes even more sense here, considering how powerful the A7s II should be when shooting in low light. Last year Sony said the stabilization added 4.5 stops of exposure compensation to the A7 II, and there's no reason to expect it would be any different here. Speaking of that, the A7s II has the same, astronomical ISO range of 50 to 409,600 as its predecessor. But Sony says that the camera's image processor has been upgraded with a new algorithm that should make it even more capable in low light, particularly at ""the mid-high end of the ISO scale."" Any bump in performance would be significant, because the original A7s already offered jaw-dropping performance at high ISOs — just look at this video that was shot in nothing but moonlight:    As much as Sony's A7 and A7r cameras are aimed at photographers, the A7s line is made for videographers, and so the company has made some other improvements to the A7s II that will please minds obsessed with moving pictures. The camera can shoot 4K video at a higher bitrate than before, 100 Mbps, and now it can capture that footage internally. (Users of the original A7s needed an external recording device to capture 4K footage.) Sony also says the camera can capture this 4K footage without any ""pixel binning,"" which is when an image sensor combines the information captured by neighboring pixels to reduce noise, resulting in a slight sacrifice in quality. The A7s II can also record slow motion 1080p footage at 120 frames per second, which is five times slower than normal speed. Other improvements have been made to the A7s II, like an upgrade to the autofocus system that increases the AF point count to 169. Sony promises that not only will the autofocusing in the A7s II work better in low light — something that is always a challenge, regardless of who makes the camera — and it will be two times faster in video mode than the original A7s. The camera's electronic viewfinder has also been upgraded, and the camera's grip and shutter buttons have a new design as well. Improvements like these are always welcome, but it's hard to tell how significant they are without a real world test. The rest of the camera has stayed more or less the same. The 35mm-sized full-frame sensor still captures 12.2 megapixels. There's a tilting LCD screen on the back of the camera for lining up shots with it at your hip or over your head. The A7s II is also Wi-Fi and NFC-enabled, and you can control it with Sony's (pedestrian) PlayMemories mobile app. News about upgrades to the mediocre battery performance — one of the biggest sticking points with all of the A7 cameras — is conspicuously absent from the press release, but you should expect it to last about 350 shots. Sony says the new A7s II will be available in October for ""about $3,000"" in the US. The company also says that it will add seven new full-frame lenses to its lineup by early 2016, which means owners of the A7s II (and the rest of the A7 line) will have 20 native lenses to pick from.",0.5952196077148177,0.40478039228518226,0.1760819129576254,666,4.6186186186186182,331,5.8066465256797581,0,0,"Photography, Tech"

Data collected by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft reveals that the gas surrounding the dwarf planet extends as far as 1,000 miles outward into space. That's more than 13 times farther than Earth's atmosphere, which tapers off at around 75 miles above our planet's surface. Previous observations from Earth have only been able to record Pluto's atmosphere reaching 170 miles out into space. Pluto's atmosphere has an extended reach About an hour after its flyby of Pluto, New Horizons used its Alice imaging spectrograph to gather information about the atmosphere. The data had to be collected during a special time when New Horizons passed through Pluto's shadow and the Sun backlit the dwarf planet. It's an event known as solar occultation, and it allows the spectrograph to measure the wavelengths of the Sun's light filtered through Pluto's atmosphere. Changes in wavelengths help researchers figure out what gases make up the atmosphere. At the highest altitudes, the atmosphere is comprised mostly of molecular nitrogen. Closer to the planet, methane mixes in with the nitrogen, followed by hydrocarbons at the lowest altitudes.   A significant portion of this gaseous mixture is also escaping out into space — around 500 tons of material per hour. NASA New Horizons team member Fran Bagenal noted that the atmospheric gases are escaping thanks in part to the weaker gravity on Pluto. But she also said it's possible solar wind is colliding with the escaping atmosphere and carrying it outward into space. The New Horizons SWAP (Solar Wind Around Pluto) instrument found evidence of an ionized tail behind Pluto — a result of ionized particles from the Sun mixing with the atmosphere and pushing it beyond the edge of the Solar System. Right now New Horizons is 2 million miles past Pluto, and the spacecraft has sent back only 1 to 2 percent of its data back to Earth. Bagenal says they'll be able to discern more about Pluto's atmosphere as they receive more data from New Horizons other instruments. By next week, we should have about 5 percent of the spacecraft's data, and we'll get the full 100 percent over the next 16 months.

A study of polar bear metabolism contradicts a long-held idea that polar bears might be able to lower their metabolic rates to conserve energy during the summer, when their icy hunting grounds melt. Given the threat of climate change, the finding intensifies an already dire situation that led to the polar bear's 2008 listing as a globally threatened species under the US Endangered Species Act. Polar bears ""walk around on the surface of the sea ice, and wait to prey upon seals that come up to the surface,"" says John Whiteman, a polar bear ecologist at the University of Wyoming and a co-author of the study, published today in Science. That hunting method means that polar bears rely heavily on ice to survive — ice that has been melting at an increasingly rapid pace. Scientists thought the bears experienced ""walking hibernation."" The ice melt might seem like a pretty scary situation for the bears, but some researchers weren't so sure; they suggested that these predators might have a secret weapon that could help them weather the melt. ""There had long been an idea that polar bears can reduce their metabolism during the summer to resemble that of winter hibernation,"" Whiteman says; doing that would reduce their need for food during the summer. Scientists called this ""walking hibernation"" — a state where the bears remain active while also minimizing the physiological stresses of fasting. But the evidence for this response was limited, Whiteman says. And ""even though no one had studied polar bear metabolism in the way we tested it in this paper, the idea was perpetuated.""   University of Wyoming researchers Hank Harlow, left, and John Whiteman collect a breath sample from a polar bear on pack ice in October 2009. Credit: Daniel Cox  To figure out what was actually going on with the bears in the summer, Whiteman and his team of scientists shot darts from helicopters to chemically immobilize over two dozen polar bears. Then, they measured and weighed the bears before surgically inserting an implant into their abdomens. The implant then recorded the bears' core body temperatures once per hour for a period of two years. Some of the bears also received a collar equipped with a radio transmitter — so they could be tracked via GPS — and an accelerometer, which was used to determine how active the bears were. Thanks to these sensors, the researchers found that although bears lower their metabolic rate during the summer, it's a very gradual process that resembles what any mammal would experience in response to fasting; their reaction doesn't come close to what's seen in bears during winter hibernation. In short, whatever ability some researchers thought the polar beats might have to counteract the negative consequences of ice loss doesn't appear to exist — polar bears can't enter a ""walking hibernation"" state. No secret defense mechanism The data collected in the study wasn't perfect. The number of bears studied was small and they belonged to a very specific wild population that dwells in the Southern Beaufort Sea region. This means that they might not be representative of all polar bears. In addition, internal body temperature can vary depending on the tissues sampled, so it would have been better if the researchers had inserted numerous implants in different types of tissues, Whiteman says. But ""for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is ethical, that's not possible.""   University of Wyoming researchers John Whiteman and Merav Ben-David inspect a temperature logger implantation site on a polar bear on off-shore sea ice north of Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, in April 2009. Credit: Mike Lockhart  The study describes polar bear metabolism for the first time, which means that other groups will have to replicate the work to ensure that it's correct. But in the meantime, the study indicates that the bodies of polar bears won't adapt very well to melting ice. ""Currently, some subpopulations are doing poorly due to loss of their sea ­ice habitats, and other subpopulations appear to be doing well,"" says Eric Regher, a wildlife biologist at the US Fish and Wildlife Service and a co-author of the study. But ""nearly all polar bears are likely to be negatively affected if sea ­ice loss continues as projected by scientists.""",0.3618854844688302,0.6381145155311698,0.7991604096372805,739,5.0081190798376181,385,6.0545454545454547,0,4,"Science, Report"

We heard that following Orbital Sciences’ Antares explosion in October 28th, 2014, as well as the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo crash on October 31st.   It’s time to stop saying that. Because of course spaceflight is hard. As President Kennedy said, it’s why we pursue it in the first place. No one in their right mind could possibly think shooting cargo and people into lower Earth orbit at over 21,000 miles per hour is a simple task. Our aerospace engineers are brilliant, and the fact that we have a small population of people consistently living in orbit around our planet is nothing short of a miracle. But our species is characterized by our ability to make last year’s miracle seem like this year’s child’s play. Just over 50 years ago, color televisions were a novelty; now we’re working on fully immersive virtual reality. Smallpox killed 300 million people in the 20th century alone — we eradicated it with vaccination. We achieve the seemingly impossible and then move beyond that to accomplish the even more impossible — it’s what we do. Except in spaceflight, where we always let ourselves off the hook. Saying ""space is hard"" gives us a pass for our mistakes, like an adult comforting a toddler after a nasty fall. It’s a way of patting ourselves on the back when things don’t go the way we want them. ""It’s okay that you didn’t succeed; it was really hard."" If we intend to be serious about space, we should say, ""Yes, it was hard. Why didn’t you succeed?"" Saying ""space is hard"" gives us a pass for our mistakes We need a significant attitude shift in how we think of spaceflight. Rocket science is no longer fringe or experimental. It is marching into the mainstream, and it should be held to the same high standards as other pervasive technological systems. Accidents in the field are not okay — they’re embarrassments. That’s not because we are incompetent. It’s because we can — and should — make rocket failures a thing of the past. Spaceflight is not a novelty; spaceflight mistakes should be. Mistakes will never be eliminated, of course. They shouldn’t be routine — three resupply accidents in the last 12 months is frankly alarming —and they certainly shouldn’t be excused. ""Space is hard"" is an excuse. And it’s one we should stop using — because NASA has its sights set on Mars. That excuse won’t fly when human lives are on the line. If space is so hard that we cannot routinely send supplies to the ISS, how do we expect to get people to the Red Planet? What confidence can that possibly create in NASA’s ambitious programs for human spaceflight? We’re not amateurs anymore. We’re not cheerleaders, either. If private space companies can’t get these basic resupply missions right, why should we trust them to do anything else?

French business news channel BFMTV reports that the executives are suspected of ""inciting undeclared work."" The interrogations come on the heels of a nationwide strike staged by French taxi unions in protest against UberPop, which connects users with non-professional drivers. Taxi unions allege that the service gives Uber an unfair competitive advantage, because UberPop drivers are not held to the same regulatory requirements. French government officials have said that UberPop is illegal under a law passed late last year that requires all drivers to hold insurance and professional licenses. UberPop drivers are currently not required to hold either, but the service has been allowed to continue after a Paris appeals court declined to rule on its legality in March. A constitutional court is expected to issue a decision on UberPop's legality in September. Arrests made as part of ongoing probe Today's interrogations are not explicitly connected to last week's protests, though French officials have toughened their stance following the strike. France's interior minister has called on Paris police to enforce a ban on the service, threatening to arrest drivers and seize cars. Earlier today, the ministry announced that 200 police had been deployed across Paris to patrol the streets for UberPop drivers. In March, French police raided Uber's Paris offices as part of the investigation, in an act that Uber at the time described as a ""disproportionate action.""

""Just to be clear, you're Amar and I'm Cyril, and we're friends,"" he says. ""So that's what we'll say if we get stopped by the police, okay?"" I agree, and I understand his concern. Yesterday, some UberPop drivers and other private chauffeurs were attacked by unionized taxi drivers who went on strike across France, as part of a massive anti-Uber protest. Striking drivers burned tires, overturned cars, and smashed windows across Paris and other major cities on Thursday, while blocking access to airports and major train stations. France's interior minister has since ordered the Paris police to enforce a ban on UberPop, a low-cost service that pairs users with non-professional drivers, saying that all caught drivers would have their cars seized.  ""I've never had a problem with the police, because I'm very discrete,"" Cyril, 30, tells me as we drive across town on a muggy Friday morning. He's been working as an UberPop driver for about nine months now, but only during the mornings and evenings, when he's not at his full-time job delivering groceries. He earns an extra €1,300 to €1,400 a month chauffeuring Uber users around Paris, which he says gives him a much-needed cushion to support his wife and two young children. But he realizes that those days may now be numbered. A law passed late last year requires all chauffeurs to have a license and insurance. Cyril and other UberPop drivers are currently not obligated to have training or insurance, and do not have to pay licensing fees, which taxi unions say gives the company an unfair competitive advantage. (Taxi licenses in France can cost up to $270,000.) The French government has said that UberPop, as it currently operates, is illegal under the new law, but Uber has contested the decision and the service remains available, albeit in a legal gray zone. A constitutional court this week began hearing a case that will determine whether UberPop can continue to operate under the new laws, after months of heightening tensions between taxi drivers and Uber chauffeurs.   Recent weeks have seen a spate of attacks against Uber drivers and passengers in France. On at least two occasions in Strasbourg, taxi drivers posed as Uber customers to lure chauffeurs to remote locations and assault them. Cyril says he's never been attacked or intimidated by taxi drivers, but he's worried about falling for a similar trap, because he's not sure how much support he can count on from Uber. ""There's no phone number to reach them, everything's through email,"" he explains. ""If we were ever in a big conflict with a taxi, I don't think they would be able to respond quick enough. Physically, we have nothing to protect us."" Cyril says he understands why the taxi unions are incensed; many drivers have to take out significant loans to obtain licenses, and it can take years to pay them off. But he's also invested money of his own (""I wouldn't have bought this car if it weren't for UberPop"") and disputes the notion that amateur chauffeurs like himself are stealing business from taxis. ""I think there's enough work for both Uber and taxis,"" he says, adding that most of his clients are young and tech-savvy, while older customers tend to prefer taxis. But he also blames cab drivers for pushing many to Uber and other ride-hailing apps. ""There are certain taxis that just refuse to take people for no reason, even if their green light is on,"" he says. (I can confirm this is true.) Those who order taxis on their phone, he adds, have to pay for the time it takes them to arrive, so their trips always begin with a running meter. (Also true.) ""It's not logical. Technology advances, everyone has a smartphone. They just need to find a way to keep up."" At around 11AM, Cyril drops me off near the Porte Maillot, one of the major traffic circles along the western edge of Paris. Police have blocked off every street leading into the circle, where around 50 to 60 taxis are parked in rows for another day of protests. Other demonstrations are planned in other parts of the city, but the blockades that crippled traffic yesterday have now receded. The officers are decked out in full riot gear, but they seem to have overdressed. Groups of taxi drivers are chatting in front of a hulking convention center that overlooks the plaza, while others are lounging in their cars, feet dangling out of windows. There are no burning tires, no overturned cars, and no Uber drivers to confront. Some taxi drivers spent the night here at Porte Maillot. Others, like Perrotin Yuhong, a 46-year-old Chinese woman with bright red hair, arrived at 3AM. ""We're just asking the government to respect the law,"" Yuhong told me from the fully reclined seat of her taxi. ""The license fees are enormous, and [UberPop drivers] don't have to pay any of that. And living here is getting more expensive for everybody — we can't breathe."" Yuhong's taxi is parked near the end of a long row of cabs. Some are draped with a French flag; others are adorned with handmade signs that read: ""With Uber, I'll be sleeping in the street in six months."" A slogan spray-painted on a wall in the center of the traffic circle reads: ""Death to Uber."" Yet for all the flare and protest slogans, there's very little in the way of actual protesting — probably because there aren't many people around to listen. With traffic shut off, the unions' audience is limited to tourists and businesspeople, who shuttle rollaway suitcases in and out of the convention center with little more than passing interest in the crowd outside. Instead, the taxi drivers are figuring out how to manage their image now that their strike has been swept from the front pages. By the time I arrive, many are just learning of a terrorist attack at a factory in Lyon, where a worker was beheaded this morning by attackers. At around midday, a representative from one taxi union grabs a microphone to announce that some drivers have begun offering free rides to and from Charles De Gaulle airport, in an effort to show ""solidarity"" at a time of national crisis. The representative stresses that it's entirely optional for drivers to do the same, but the announcement doesn't sit well with many. A heated debate soon unfolds. ""If I'm on strike, that means I don't work,"" shouts one driver. ""What message does that send?"" Others merely shrug it off and return to their cars. No one, as far as I can tell, volunteers to participate in the PR campaign. Some drivers acknowledge that their public image took a hit yesterday, but they describe the violence as a product of government inaction. ""The government has been making promises to us for years, and they still haven't been fulfilled,"" says Salif, 29. ""We've had several peaceful protests during these years, and the government did nothing. Now, as you saw yesterday with the government's announcements, they finally did something because of the incidents, and they wouldn't have done anything if there hadn't been incidents."" ""The violence was necessary, because the government made it necessary,"" he adds. ""And you see that today there aren't any incidents, because we see that they finally take us seriously."" Others take issue with the way the media has portrayed their strike, saying it ignores the reality of their economic hardship. ""The media gives us a bad image, as if we're bad people,"" Yves tells me, standing in front of an anti-Uber protest poem he scribbled in marker on top of a bus stop advertisement for Tom Ford cologne. ""But that violence is just a call for help. It comes from hopelessness."" Yves, 32 and tattooed, has been driving a taxi in Paris for seven years, and he says he's seen a decline of between 20 and 50 percent in his revenue since Uber arrived in 2011. Like Salif, he thinks this week's strike was essential to affect change, though he says it could've been avoided if the government had taken swifter action on UberPop's legality. ""Why didn't they make a decision earlier?"" he says. ""Why did they wait for us to start breaking things before listening to us?"" At around 1PM, a taxi full of oranges and bottled water pulls up to the site. Some swarm to it for relief from the heat; others decline because they're fasting for Ramadan. I decide to make my way home, and check for an Uber. A few minutes later, a driver named Karim meets me just beyond the police blockade. As an UberX chauffeur, he's licensed as a full-time driver, with all the required training, so unlike Cyril, he doesn't have to worry about the legality of his job. Although he sympathizes with the taxi unions' demands, he remains dismayed by their tactics. ""I've never seen a strike like that in France,"" he says of yesterday's violence. ""Not even in Algeria."" He also thinks taxi unions are overlooking the broader benefits that Uber brings. The company has come under scrutiny from unions and regulators across the globe, largely over the question of whether to treat it as a transportation service, or tech startup. In Karim's view, it's important that Uber continue to operate in any capacity, especially at a time of high unemployment among French youth. ""There are a lot of young people now who work for Uber, people from the suburbs, people without diplomas, like me,"" he says, adding that UberPop provides easy employment to people who may not be able to afford a taxi license. ""Thanks to Uber, I know a lot of people who now have enough money to feed their families."" But he agrees that the government should've taken more decisive action on UberPop. And because it didn't, it now faces a tough choice. ""They're blocked,"" he says as the car pulls up to my building. ""On one side, you have Uber, with all the money, and on the other you have the taxis, with all the violence. And they don't know which one to side with."" ""But they don't like violence, which is why I think they'll block UberPop eventually. I know they will.""",0.35122550549222065,0.6487744945077794,0.8495291207862703,1734,4.7762399077277973,835,6.0874251497005991,1,12,"Apps, Policy & Law, Tech, Transportation, US & World, Report"

The mission was also going to serve as the third test of SpaceX's plan to make a reusable rocket. The first stage of the Falcon 9 was supposed to separate three minutes after launch and land itself on a drone ship at sea. The next time SpaceX is scheduled to test the Falcon 9's reusability is on the August 9th launch of the Jason-3 satellite. SpaceX has said that landing will be attempted on land at Vandenburg Airforce Base, not at sea, but it is unclear if today's failure will affect the launch schedule.

Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, has another resupply mission scheduled for July 3rd. Since NASA always plans ahead with its cargo deliveries, the astronauts are currently stocked through September with supplies. Elon Musk says something ruptured the rocket's liquid oxygen tank, causing the explosion:  There was an overpressure event in the upper stage liquid oxygen tank. Data suggests counterintuitive cause. Musk says the team will conduct a thorough analysis to figure out what caused the rupture. There was over 5,000 pounds of supplies, food, and science experiments inside the Dragon cargo ship that was affixed to the top of the rocket. Included with the experiments were two of Microsoft's HoloLens devices, which the astronauts were going to use to communicate with control room operators and to augment their tasks, all part of a test program called Sidekick.  Space is hard... @NASA we're with you and ready to try again! It is unclear whether this cargo was lost or not, as it appears possible that the Dragon cargo ship blasted away from the explosion. Still, this is the third space station resupply mission to fail in the last year, and the second in a row. Last October, Orbital ATK's Antares rocket exploded on the launchpad.

Escher died in 1972, leaving behind iconic optical illusions that are now generations old. Painter Joy Garnett was born in 1965, and her career is in full swing. But when nanoscience researcher Robert Hovden copied works from both for a recent project, he could use Garnett’s with impunity. Escher’s estate, meanwhile, thinks he’s breaking the law. Unless he told you, though, you’d never know he’s ripping off someone else’s work. ""They think that's maybe where the art is. But probably not."" When Art Exceeds Perception looks like an exhibit of blank gray discs. Those silicon discs, however, hold a series of miniscule etchings: sketches made by a process called nanoscale lithography, in which charged ions blast away silicon atoms like an invisible chisel. The technique can be used for beautiful effects, like sandcastles printed on a single grain of sand. In this case, the images' individual details are roughly a tenth of a micron wide, and each picture is so small that it’s impossible to see even with a high-powered optical microscope — you’d have to turn to more recent inventions like the scanning tunneling microscope. At Cornell University’s Jill Stuart Gallery, where the installation will hang until December, ""people will stare, and they usually find small imperfections in the disk,"" says Hovden. ""They think maybe that's where the art is. But probably not."" Intellectual property creates an incentive for artists and inventors by letting them profit from their work, but Hovden’s pieces demonstrate the levels of surreality it can reach. The Escher estate, in fact, was deeply unamused by his idea. ""All of [Escher’s] work is protected by (international) copyright laws and unauthorised use is thus punishable by law. The size of the (unauthorised) reproduction is irrelevant,"" said Mark Veldhuijsen, who manages licensing, in an email to The Verge. ""What actually does amaze me, is the fact that you write that it is an artist who produces these small works. An artist should realise whether something is original, or just ordinary thievery.""   If Hovden had etched his source materials at scale, you probably could call it blatant plagiarism of some of the best-known works of the mid-20th century: Escher’s tessellations, for example, along with Henry Matisse’s Le Platane and Rene Magritte’s The Treachery of Images. Or you could call it appropriation art — a legally and ethically gray category that’s created landmark copyright feuds over, say, whether a collage artist who paints over the subject’s eyes and mouth in a photo creates a new work (the case was settled, so we’ll never be quite sure.) As it is, though, When Art Exceeds Perception is a test of our increasingly stringent copyright laws. ""I think maybe the better title of this project would be Reductio ad Absurdum,"" says Hovden. Technically, what he’s made is a traditional sort of reproduction. Each piece ""is not digitized or encrypted like information on your hard drive,"" he insists. ""This is a real replica in normal interpretable space, and it's been hung on the wall for public display."" And since the standard copyright term lasts 70 years after the creator’s death, those reproductions won’t be legal for decades. But no human eye will ever see any of them, and just figuring out where they are on the disc would be like ""finding a parked car in the state of New York."" And if virtually no one can tell what it is, who would hold him accountable for copying? Can something really be a copy if you'll never be able to see it? Hovden says he thinks of his work as a commentary on artistic integrity in general, not just regulation. ""The law doesn't necessarily have to represent the moral question,"" he says. ""Some people believe that the person that created the work, that that work belongs to them indefinitely."" There’s also the more subtle question of plagiarism, or at the more extreme end, forgery. Nanoscale drawings call into question what it really means to ""steal"" a work — is it enough for the piece to, theoretically, be visible? If visitors could somehow bring specialized equipment and extract the image, would that count? Is simply evoking a brand like Escher’s its own kind of violation? Garnett’s painting Laylah K is protected by a Creative Commons license, which allows Hovden to use it freely. Potentially, his other three works could be granted legal immunity under fair use rules. It’s acceptable to copy part of a work if you’re commenting on it, parodying it, or presenting research on it, among other things. But the limits on fair use are only determined through lawsuits, and the US Copyright Office warns that they will ""not always be clear or easily defined."" Courts will judge each case by weighing four factors, including how much of the original work is used and whether it will hurt the market for it. ""When you do projects in the domain of fair use, you can't really feel secure in your actions in knowing that they're legal,"" says Hovden. It’s all about the context of an image, and how people use it — one court said Google Image Search was infringing on other sites by copying image thumbnails from them, another said it legally ""transformed"" the photos by shrinking the originals and using them as a search tool. In theory, these works should eventually fall into the public domain, where they can be copied and remixed at will. But copyright terms have been extended multiple times — they’ve gone from a maximum of around 30 years to, at present, the creator’s life plus 70 years, and there’s no reason to think it won’t be extended again. The Supreme Court has even ruled that Congress can take works out of the public domain and re-copyright them.   Whatever the legal status, though, there’s little chance that Escher, Magritte, or Matisse’s estates will lose money because of When Art Exceeds Perception. Not only will visitors never see the tiny drawings, they’ll never even see a likeness of them — with the exception of Laylah K, no magnified images exist. ""The art director also wanted to see the pictures,"" says Hovden. ""But I felt strongly that the point of this wasn't to show a picture that you could see of these works. It would be just like taking another person's work and printing it out on your printer and hanging on the wall."" And the etchings are so delicate that even imaging them could damage the art. If Hovden had scuttled his exhibition, what would we have lost? Outside their intellectual property implications, the tiny pictures are also clever references to their source material. Escher’s tessellations mirror the array of atoms on the silicon disc, and The Treachery of Images — a picture of a pipe paired with the statement ""this is not a pipe"" — has been updated for a new century: the first evokes the idea of a pipe, the second evokes the idea of the idea of a pipe. Whether or not they’re masterpieces, it’s easier to see them as adding to culture than stealing it — which is, of course, the point.

Dezeen attended the event and has transcribed a good many of Ive's responses, so you should head over there to if you want to read everything, but a few things in particular stand out.  ""Designers cave in to marketing, to the corporate agenda."" For one, Ive shed some light on Apple's decision to give its smartwatch a far more customizable design than anything else it's made. ""One of the biggest challenges that we found was that we wouldn't all be sitting here wearing the same thing. I don't think we want to wear the same thing,"" Ive says, ""which is why we developed this system, not a single product."" Ive goes on to call it a ""flexible system"" that maintains a ""singular idea."" The result was one of the more striking aspects of the Apple Watch's design that we noticed when it was first unveiled — just by changing the watch's band, the device's entire style appears to shift. Ive says that his design team at Apple has now grown to 17 or 18 people and that no one has yet to leave it. He doesn't want to see the team grow much further. As for why his team doesn't redesign products every year, the same way that many other tech companies do, Ive says that it's a matter of not bending to what marketing teams want. ""We won't do something different for different's sake. I could start today and do something completely different, that's really easy,"" Ive says. ""What's really hard is better. I feel really strongly about this. Designers cave in to marketing, to the corporate agenda, which is sort of 'Oh it looks like the last one, can't we make it look different?' Well no, there's no reason to."" Pointing to the iMac as an example, Ive says that its design changes have been a progression based on changes in technology. ""The iMac was based on a spherical tube that took many people to lift, so of course the form should change and the materials should change,"" he says. ""We don't make any more cathode ray tube-based products and every product we make has a flat panel display."" ""Things we have been working on for eight years are copied in six months."" Ive says that a priority for designers must be learning how to fail. ""We're prepared to screw up the work that we've done and throw it away even if we don't know what we're going to do instead,"" Ive says. ""When I've explained to people before and said, 'Well we screwed this up, we parked this,' normally I can say 'and look what we went on to do.'"" That process is also the reason that Ive isn't buying the phrase about copying being a form of flattery. ""If you look at the work of the studio, and you think, 80 percent of this isn't going to work. One of the sad things is – and this is why perhaps we may seem a little testy when things we have been working on for eight years are copied in six months – but it wasn't inevitable that it was going to work. ... It's not copying, it's theft. They stole our time, time we could have had with our families. I actually feel quite strongly about it. It's funny – I was talking to somebody, and they said do you think when somebody copies what you do it's flattering? No."" Apple has, of course, made it quite clear how it feels about other companies taking inspiration from its designs, having gone through two major lawsuits against Samsung already. Those battles appear to have subsided for the time being. Ive doesn't go into incredible detail about his work at Apple, but there's a lot of general design advice that he presents over the course of the interview. Given how widely used products bearing his design are, they may just be worth reading — even if his remarks aren't too specific.

One quick glance at Saleem's website shows just how deep that fascination is: the page is covered in insane, futuristic vehicles that wouldn't look out of place in some new blockbuster video game. His pieces often take modern vehicles and splice them with space age tech and vivid, colorful paint jobs. Sometimes he even skips the modern part and goes straight to making crazy spaceships. ""I'm not sure if I'm fully sold on the whole flying cars thing yet, however,"" he says. The pieces are particularly impressive considering the Manchester-based artist only started using Photoshop four years ago, at 17 years old.

Inspired by artists like Danny LuVisi and Arron Beck, he started making his own crazy landscapes and characters.

It’s a result of a collaboration with fashion brand Opening Ceremony, and the two companies believe that the device can solve the problems they discovered in their research women had, like fumbling for phones during meetings or needing extra space to store one when planning a night out. The $495 smart cuff lets users receive, dismiss, and quick-reply to text messages, email, and Facebook or Google notifications — but it won’t do it via Bluetooth like many other wearable devices. Instead, it works independently of the user’s smartphone thanks to its own connectivity with AT&T’s 3G network, and a two-year data plan is included in the price tag (though you're on your own after that). That also means users will have to manage being reachable at a second phone number, but that's something that both Opening Ceremony and Intel claimed is a desired solution for the ""women on the go"" that they're targeting. In those respects, the MICA is comparable to will.i.am's Puls smartwatch, except instead of trying to make a high-end device that everyone desires, Intel and Opening Ceremony are aiming at this very specific demographic. MICA serves up notifications via AT&T's 3G network — not Bluetooth  In addition to those basic notifications, the MICA also offers intelligent reminders — or as Intel calls them, ""Time to Go"" reminders — generated by technology from TomTom and Intel. With these, it uses location data to adjust the time required for the user to get to events and appointments automatically. Location data also works with Yelp, which can serve up ratings and reviews based on what is nearby, or let MICA wearers perform local searches. It does all of this with up to two days of battery life, and the device is charged by a micro-USB connection which is hidden in the clasp. The high-fashion device will come in two 18-karat gold-coated styles — one with black water snake skin, Chinese pearls and lapis stones from Madagascar, and the other features whitewater snake skin with South African tiger’s eye and Russian obsidian. All of this surrounds a 1.6-inch, 256 x 160 OLED display made with curved sapphire glass, which is where users will interact with MICA. The software of the MICA is built on a custom version of Linux, which means that companies would have to consider developing for yet another platform if they wish to reach this market. For Intel, that's something they believe the parties involved are committed to. ""We are already thinking about adding a couple of different features and functionalities because it can be updated over the top,"" Ildeniz told me. During the panel discussion she likened it to the way that Intel treats its Edison chip as a platform for the ""Internet of things"" as opposed to a commercial product. The stylish device is certainly unique, but also marks the newest result of what is becoming a long list of collaborations between fashion designers and tech companies. From Google partnering with Diane von Furstenberg for a line of fashion-forward versions of Google Glass, to Apple hiring Marc Newson, hardware makers have begun to embrace the idea that the utilitarian devices they’re creating often need a little outside help when it comes to making them approachable. In the end, Intel and Opening Ceremony believe they have obfuscated the trouble of marketing actual smartwatches to this demographic of fashion-forward women who are looking to stay connected by creating a device specifically for them.

Called The Dream Machine, the plan was build all of the sets and finish the game in around two years. Things didn't quite go as planned. The first episode of the game launched in 2011, but delays saw later episodes spread out over a long period of time. The fifth and penultimate episode launches today, six years after work first started. ""I can hardly remember life before The Dream Machine,"" says Zaring. ""I have moved four times and raised two kids during this period. When this is all over I will feel a great relief, as well as terrible nostalgia."" The game starts out with a young couple moving into a new apartment. It's a slow burn through episode one, as you learn about the couple's history and how they're expecting a child. You'll also discover their new neighbors, some of whom are a bit strange. But then something weird happens when you discover a huge machine, the titular device that lets you explore people's dreams and view their subconscious. The gameplay is simple, reminiscent of classic PC adventure games like Monkey Island, but the visual style is what helps differentiate it, and bring the dreamscapes to life. And that look is built not with polygons, but with a huge range of real world materials — the designers used everything from cardboard and clay to broccoli and coffee grounds to build the characters and locations. Those materials also came with their own set of challenges. Stop motion is a time-consuming process, and that doesn't change when you're making a video game. The first two episodes of The Dream Machine launched simultaneously, and the third episode was available later that year, but it took a full two years for episode four to come out. According to the developers, fans have been mostly patient when it comes to delays, but the protracted development has taken its toll on the duo. Without the funds to add any more staff, it's been up to Gustafsson and Zaring to complete this massive undertaking. ""Keeping the motivation when times are rough is always a challenge,"" says Zaring. But that's not to say it hasn't been rewarding. ""Experiencing the organic process of creating the game, the way happy accidents have lead us down strange and fruitful paths, that has been amazing,"" says Gustafsson. ""Seeing some new artwork by Erik, getting unexpected ideas from it, being able to execute on whims without some gigantic production machine grinding to a halt. Following a plan, but being open to change should better ideas come along. Letting the game tell us what it wants to be. That’s been a lot of fun."" That experience is nearing its end, however. The series has already taken more than six years to build, but it's almost done; after today's episode there's just one more to finish. And when that happens, neither is quite sure what they'll do. ""Initially I’ll just re-read all reviews over and over again until I fall asleep,"" says Zaring. ""Then, hopefully, I’ll start dreaming about new beautiful things to come.""

But a reimagined layout for the Smithsonian Castle campus — said to be the most significant change to the National Mall in a century — seeks to change that. The new design, unveiled this week, plans to open up the campus around the Smithsonian's adminstrative building, which includes the Freer Gallery, the Hishhorn Museum, the (currently empty) Arts and Industries building, and the underground Sackler Gallery and African Art Museum. The Smithsonian's cultural hub is located in the middle of the National Mall, between heavyweights like the US Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the White House, which means it's got lots of competition. The current design, which is a mishmash of buildings built over the past century, can be difficult for tourists to navigate and isn't up-to-par for modern exhibitions. In addition, it faces away from the National Mall, making it less inviting to those walking from the US Capitol to other sites. Pictures of the proposed Smithsonian Castle redesign for the National Mall PreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext The primary issue fixed by the redesign are a pair of matching above-ground entrances to the Sackler Gallery and African Art Museum. The architectural team at the BIG-Bjarke Ingels Group has proposed peeling up the edges of the current Haupt Garden to make the new entrances and bring natural light to the galleries below. The portals, combined with a completely remade public square, should make an entirely new, inviting space. The plan also calls for turning the Smithsonian Castle, dating from 1855, to the centerpiece of a visit to the grounds. The largely administrational building will be opened up inside, allowing for new spaces for services and other amenities. Making additional space from current buildings is central to the entire design — most all of the structures would be modified under the plans to make additional space for galleries, bringing the exhibition spaces up-to-date for modern shows. Unfortunately, you shouldn't expect to see any of these changes during your next visit to D.C. The plans, which have been in the works for a year and a half, don't include a solid timeline or funding. The Smithsonian expects to use a mixture of public and private funding to raise the $2 billion needed for the project, and even then the renovations won't be complete for 15 to 20 years.",0.6995123713265023,0.30048762867349765,0.8820092638541666,417,5.1750599520383691,239,6.2761506276150625,0,0,"Design, Architecture"

Pao lost the case, and hasn't yet said whether she would appeal. In some of her first extended comments since the trial, Pao appeared at the Code Conference today calling on other people who have experienced discrimination to share their own stories — and said doing so may help improve diversity in Silicon Valley as much as anything. Pao left the trial with no regrets, she said. ""I connected with so many people,"" she told Kara Swisher of Recode at the conference, which as of yesterday is part of The Verge's parent company, Vox Media. ""They connected with a story that I told. And that was important to me."" It isn't just women who have approached her, Pao said. She recalled one man approaching her telling her that he supported her because his mother had been relegated to working in a closet after she was grudgingly promoted. ""I connected with so many people."" Pao's case hinged on why Pao hadn't been promoted at Kleiner after years of clashing with her superiors. The jury didn't find evidence of discrimination based on the evidence presented, even though some expressed serious misgivings about Kleiner Perkins' culture in interviews afterward. Pao said that the conversations generated during and after the case have made people more comfortable calling out instances of sexism when they see it. She noted that Google's executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, was pilloried after continually interrupting former colleague (and current United States CTO) Megan Smith at South by Southwest. ""Six months ago I don't think they would have said anything,"" Pao said. ""Now people are speaking up, calling attention to it."" As for Schmidt, she said, ""he's now more aware of the things that he does. I'm sure he doesn't aspire to be the guy who talks over women."" ""God I hate the pipeline issue."" What else can be done to improve diversity in Silicon Valley? Pao was critical of those who say nothing can be done until America fixes its ""pipeline"" of women and minority candidates coming out of colleges. ""God I hate the pipeline issue,"" she said. More pressing, she said, is the fact that women and minorities are often treated poorly once they begin working at tech companies. ""When you talk about the pipeline, it's an excuse not to do anything,"" she said. Pao is now interim CEO at Reddit, and hinted that she may become permanent CEO if her first full year on the job goes well. She has already implemented new hiring practices designed to ensure women and minorities are paid as well as men, who are typically able to negotiate for higher salaries without being penalized for it. Asked about the biggest misconception about her, Pao said that people often wrongly assume her motives are complex. ""That's the most untrue thing that's out there about me — I'm actually not that complicated,"" she said. Pao said she grew up in a small town in New Jersey, taught that America was a meritocracy and that hard work would be rewarded.

Tom Rutledge, who is Charter's current chief executive, pledged during a conference call that New Charter would keep away from data caps and some of Comcast's unpopular business tactics. ""Through Charter, we’ll offer consumers a broadband product that makes watching online video, gaming, and engaging in other data-hungry applications a great experience, including at peak times,"" Rutledge said during a conference call yesterday. No data caps and no paid prioritization He also said that Charter will steer clear of paid prioritization — even if the FCC's new net neutrality rules are ultimately defeated in court by broadband providers. Charter will ""not block, throttle, or engage in paid prioritization of internet traffic,"" Rutledge said during an interview yesterday. Two other things make Charter's acquisition more likely to survive regulatory scrutiny. First, the combined company wouldn't possess nearly the same level of control over US broadband as the doomed Comcast and Time Warner Cable pairing. If the merger is successful, Charter will hold less than 30 percent of the high-speed broadband market compared to the 57 percent stake that Comcast / TWC would've claimed. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said that deal ""posed an unacceptable risk to competition and innovation"" and risked harming video services like Netflix. And second, unlike Comcast, Charter isn't a content company. It doesn't own TV networks or cable channels, nor does it have a direct business interest in any particular video service. Comcast's ownership of NBCUniversal proved to be yet another hurdle for regulators who feared the company would eventually favor its own content over other programming. With Charter, there are no such concerns. If approved, the merger would nearly quadruple Charter's customer base to cover 24 million accounts across 41 states. (Comcast has 27 million customers.)

A separate acquisition by Charter of the smaller cable company Bright House Networks for $10.4 billion means that the new company will soon have 23.9 million customers in 41 states. The merger will still have to be approved by regulators This is the fourth time Charter has tried to acquire Time Warner Cable in the last three years, with this week's deal only made possible after Comcast abandoned its own $45 billion merger with TWC due to resistance from regulators. Charter's cash-and-stock deal — valuing Time Warner Cable at $195 a share — will still have to be approved by regulators, but according to reports from Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, FCC boss Tom Wheeler recently called the heads of both Charter and TWC to assure them that despite what happened with Comcast, there isn't an outright ban on such mergers. In a statement released after the announcement of the deal, Wheeler said: ""The FCC reviews every merger on its merits and determines whether it would be in the public interest. In applying the public interest test, an absence of harm is not sufficient. The Commission will look to see how American consumers would benefit if the deal were to be approved."" Even if the deal is approved, Comcast will remain the biggest US cable provider with around 27 million customers. The creation of New Charter comes at a time when cable companies are struggling to keep up with the changing habits of American TV viewers. The rise of streaming video and competition from tech-savvy companies like Netflix and Amazon has created a difficult market, and mergers such as this give cable companies greater leverage when bargaining with TV networks.

There isn't a ton of new information on exactly how big Snapchat is — it's still referred vaguely as having more than 100 million active users — but the pitch to advertisers will be the details of that audience: more than 60 percent of Americans age 13–34 are claimed as active users. Can Snapchat replace TV? That user base consumes over 2 billion videos a day. Compare that to Facebook, which is 10 times larger, but does just about twice as many video views per day. Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel believes that the mobile experience he is building will replace traditional TV and desktop viewing and that all its products, including advertising, should be built with a smartphone screen in mind. Spiegel doesn't want to use targeted advertising based on user data. Instead he has opted for things like the Discover feature the company launched earlier this year, which featured a selection of stories from well-known media brands. While it started off strong, Bloomberg and others report that usage has dropped off dramatically over time. In response, ad rates have declined from $100 per 1,000 views to around $20. Facebook is most popular among teens The story also points out that while Snapchat has won a reputation as the best way to reach that coveted millennial audience, other data points suggest it's not the only game in town. Among US teens age 13–17, both Facebook and Instagram are more popular. So what will make Snapchat stand out? The piece argues that it's Spiegel's commitment to creating a unique product and treatment of advertising as an integral part of the experience, not a necessary evil, that will make Snapchat stand out. ""A lot of people look at internet advertising as a tax on the system,"" he told Bloomberg. ""That’s sort of discouraging if you care about making new products and especially discouraging if you feel like you can solve problems.""

The Pittsburgh Business Times notes that the device at the very top of the car was rotating, suggesting that it's a LIDAR sensor being used to map the immediate surroundings. The device has an identical profile to LIDAR components deployed in Google's self-driving vehicles but looks completely different to the equipment seen on the so-called Apple car.

Today the partnership between the two parties deepens, with the announcement of the Skyfund, a joint initiative to invest in drone startups and more broadly across the booming field of robotics and intelligent machines. Make it rain They aren't alone. This morning Airware, one of the better-funded drone startups in Silicon Valley, announced it was launching its own venture, the Commercial Drone Fund, with plans to pour millions into exactly the same strategy. The fund will be overseen by Airware CEO Jonathan Downey. It announced the first two recipients this morning, RedBird and Sky Futures. Both companies are attempting to position themselves as a platform for the burgeoning drone industry. By handing out cash and access, they hope to become the center of a new wave of startups and services, much as the iPhone and Facebook served as the foundation for countless new mobile and desktop apps. ""With	UAVs	and	robotics,	years	of	pent	up  academic	research	in	computer	vision,	batteries,	AI, and	navigation	now	has	a	vessel	for	  commercialization,"" said Skyfund's creators. ""A legion of entrepreneurs who historically were tethered to government and university labs,"" are now poised to strike out on their own.    The Skyfund won't just provide entrepreneurs with cash, but also ""technical expertise and early access,"" says Sameer Gandhi, the partner with Accel who led the recent investment, ""and, when they come up with a killer app, co-branded marketing from DJI to the world’s largest community of fliers."" Sharing access to cutting edge technology DJI released its first software development kit, or SDK, in November of 2014. Since then it's seen developers build new applications around services like 3D mapping and precision agriculture. It's hoping to find opportunities to invest, ""in companies that will push the market forward with technology right now we have no capacity to build,"" says Michael Perry, DJI's head of communications. While the company has been on the cutting edge of consumer drones, so far it has released little in the realm of sense-and-avoid technology, which many believe is the key to the next generation of more autonomous units. Having DJI as a backer could be a double-edged sword for young drone companies. While they would get access to some of the cutting edge technology in DJI's pipeline, that flow of information would likely be expected to cut both ways. Perry said there would be an arbitration process in place to handle intellectual property disputes. ""Sometimes companies will get proprietary access, sometimes not, those are normal conflicts,"" said Gandhi. Can you be the top hardware maker and also the operating system? The same issues may arise with Airware, although it seems less likely, given that it doesn't make any of its own drones. ""While the commercial drone industry is evolving rapidly, we still see gaps in the ecosystem,"" says Downey. The goal is to ""identify and boost the rising stars that are advancing important drone-related initiatives, such as powerful new sensors, intelligent analytics, or innovative field services. As they scale across use cases and geographies, there are more opportunities for us to do business together."" Downey didn't mention DJI by name, but he did point out why he felt Airware was better suited for creating the biggest platform for the drone industry. ""Our clients want to use drones from multiple manufacturers,"" he said. ""I think inherently, building out the best operating system in an industry requires you to be agonistic to the hardware underneath, and that is fundamentally at odds with being a key manufacturer.""",0.6453473662940703,0.3546526337059297,0.8230310046136528,607,5.3640856672158153,370,6.5216216216216214,0,0,"Business, Tech, Report"

However one thing that is not promised when someone becomes an Uber driver is the legal consideration of being called an ""employee"" versus an ""independent contractor."" Anyone who's worked in a company with both roles knows the difference: the former comes with numerous benefits, including expanded legal protections and maybe even a dental plan. The latter does not. And if you're a professional driver, whatever camp you fall into could also define who's footing the bill for things like gas, maintenance, and car repairs. That very issue came up when a Florida-based Uber XL driver named Darrin McGillis got in a car accident last spring and could no longer pick up passengers. While dropping off a passenger, a scooter rammed the vehicle he himself had purchased. As BuzzFeed reports, McGillis tried to get Uber to pay for the repairs with its insurance, and the company told him it was actually his problem to deal with. Out of work, he decided to file for unemployment with Florida's Department of Economic Opportunity, claiming that Uber's job description and modus operandi for drivers shared more in common with Internal Revenue Service's definition of an employee than an independent contractor. The state agreed, marking McGillis eligible for unemployment. The difference between employees and contractors makes legal issues murky If upheld, Florida's decision could signal trouble for it and other companies that want a large, dedicated, and sustainable workforce without the overhead associated with traditional transportation companies. Under the current arrangement, Uber doesn't need to worry about paying for things like paid time off, healthcare, and things like Social Security and Medicare taxes. That's allowed it to hire an army of drivers that can be scaled up or down at a moment's notice, but also created situations like McGillis's where things get murky when there's a snag. A potential driver for Uber may also take a look McGillis's situation as a cautionary tale, and factor it into whether they want to work for the company. In a statement provided to The Verge, Uber said it disagreed with the decision and planned to appeal it. A separate report on McGillis's case in The Miami Herald notes that Uber has managed to get similar state decisions overturned. While this is just one specific case, and only in one state, the battle over the independent contractor versus employee designation has been underway for decades, and extends beyond ride-sharing companies. It's been a long-running issue at FedEx, which operates with a similar contractor setup with its ground delivery drivers. That's brought class-action lawsuits, and efforts to change state laws to put liabilities on the companies. Uber and its competitor Lyft now face similar suits over whether the two companies (and others like them) should be footing the bill for things like gas and vehicle maintenance.",0.35990727384142274,0.6400927261585773,0.8956725262271249,495,5.1939393939393943,304,6.1743421052631575,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World"

Music Key represents a major initiative from YouTube to build new kinds of products — and generate new revenues — around some of the massive buckets of content hosted on the site. It contains features for both free and paid users, starting with a top-level ""Music"" tab on YouTube for iOS, Android, and the web. Free users get access to ad-supported, Pandora-like ""endless mixes"" of songs. Members of the Music Key trial get ad-free songs and music videos, along with access to Google Play Music. The combined service will eventually cost $8 a month for the trial users. Working on battery drain and data usage Since launch, YouTube has been testing a variety of features for Music Key — some visible to users, and some behind-the-scenes changes to the infrastructure. The company's music catalog has expanded, and YouTube has improved battery drain and data usage. In an email, a YouTube spokesman said beta testers ""have been a huge help in our goal of building the best subscription possible for both artists and fans. To thank them, we're extending their free trial, and we look forward to bringing this service to everyone."" The company has previously said subscription service will be available to the public sometime this year.   Like YouTube, I also feel like Music Key isn't quite there — I'm a beta tester, and appreciate not having to watch pre-roll ads on Vevo clips any more. But I've had more fun using the complementary subscription to Google Play Music, which is faster and easier to use. (Being the world's biggest repository of videos of all kinds and a worthy competitor to Spotify simultaneously is a product challenge that I suspect would bring even the world's best software designers to tears.) On my phone, where I do much of my listening, clicking on YouTube's music tab shows me three endless-mix playlists and a single music video that my search history (correctly!) suggests I would enjoy. It's ... fine. But nothing I'd pay eight bucks a month for. I suspect that YouTube is looking at the usage data for Music Key beta testers and drawing the same conclusion.

""If the conditions are approved by my colleagues, 12.5 million customer locations will have access to a competitive high-speed fiber connection.

First, in order to prevent discrimination against online video competition, AT&T will not be permitted to exclude affiliated video services and content from data caps on its fixed broadband connections. Second, in order to bring greater transparency to interconnection practices, the company will be required to submit all completed interconnection agreements to the Commission, along with regular reports on network performance.""

""These proposed rules... would have a significant negative impact on the open security research community."" The new rules are based on an international agreement signed in December 2012, but the Department of Commerce is currently in the process of deciding what they'll mean for US citizens. For months, security researchers have roundly criticized the rules as fundamentally counterproductive to security on the web. The new regulations would particularly target intrusion software, allowing export only under a specifically granted license. In theory, that would help keep security-breaking programs out of the hands of criminals, but researchers say it would also make it harder for software companies to research and defend against those attacks. ""It's impossible to build effective defenses without free and open access to the latest techniques of the attackers,"" developer Marsh Ray told The Verge in May. Many of Wassenaar's provisions were aimed at spyware vendors, which purchase vulnerabilities, package them for sale, and distribute them to oppressive regimes in countries like Ethiopia and Bahrain. But as the recent Hacking Team leak demonstrated, many of those companies have become adept at working within the export control system, acquiring licenses when possible and otherwise conducting business in secret. Google has submitted comments to the Department of Commerce asking for specific revisions to the proposed rules, seeking specific carve-outs for bug reporting and international development teams. It remains to be seen how the Department of Commerce will respond to objections, but significant revisions are likely, given the flood of critical comments from Google and others.

According to 9to5Mac, the Apple TV will begin supporting Bluetooth game controllers that are about as capable as what you'd use to control a console. The report says that the Apple TV will support pressure-sensitive buttons, joysticks, and basic motion control — that's nothing out of the ordinary, but it's enough to play more than the casual games that currently work best on iOS. It's likely that these controllers will be made by third parties, not Apple.  The Apple TV remote may only have iPhone-style motion controls What the Apple TV's controllers won't support, according to 9to5Mac, is motion control akin to what you'd find on the Wii, despite what a previous report said. Instead, it'll just include the kind of basic tilting controls that are already present on the iPhone and iPad. In other words, you'll be able to tilt the new Apple TV remote — and likely some of its controllers — to steer in a racing game, but you probably won't be able to aim a virtual weapon with it. There's been a lot of talk about the upcoming Apple TV's new remote, and 9to5Mac seems to have a final report here on what'll be on it. It's supposed to have a touchpad, a home button, and a Siri button, which will activate a voice search. That search is said to be ""near-universal,"" but the question is whether that means using Siri to open up a specific app or to find the best service to rent a specific movie through, which would be a lot more useful. The remote is also supposed to have a replaceable battery, rather than a rechargeable one. There are a number of other details about the new Apple TV that have been coming out of 9to5Mac, including that the device is believed to be getting a price between $149 and $199. The device is widely expected to have an improved interface, in addition to the new remote, with the biggest software feature being the introduction of an app store, which is where games for these controllers will come from.

Part of it’s the B-movie ghetto of the genre itself; part of it’s the indelicate work of plumbing the subconscious. Allowing people to confront the cruel, grisly truths of life through storytelling is an essential form of catharsis, but it doesn’t necessarily make for polite dinner conversation. So when I heard last night that Wes Craven, the writer-director behind movies like A Nightmare On Elm Street and Scream, had died at the age of 76, I jumped online, expecting token mentions and minor blurbs — but I found something else instead. CNN called him a ""visionary filmmaker."" The New York Times: a ""horror master."" ""Legend""; ""Maestro""; the accolades went on and on. Then again, Wes Craven never was your typical horror director.  Raised in a strict Baptist household Raised in a strict Baptist household where he wasn’t even allowed to watch most movies, Craven lost his father at the age of five. It was an upbringing full of rigorous adherence, yet punctuated by death, forming Craven’s sense that the world was a place where violence and chaos lurked just beneath the surface of everyday life. He found himself drawn to writing and philosophy in college, eventually earning a master's degree from John Hopkins and working as a professor. Nursing frustrated creative ambitions, he ended up working on a college short film, and fell hopelessly in love with filmmaking. So he quit teaching, moved his wife and two kids to New York City, and soon found himself getting steady work in the then-flourishing porn industry.  There he fell in with Sean S. Cunningham — the eventual creator of Friday the 13th — who encouraged Craven to turn the angst of his fundamentalist upbringing into horror films.  Craven responded to Cunningham’s challenge with The Last House on the Left, a notoriously violent and sadistic revenge film inspired by Ingmar Bergman’s The Virgin Spring, made on the slightest of shoestring budgets. It became an indie horror hit, and Craven followed it up with The Hills Have Eyes, another exploitation flick about a family attacked by a group of cannibals in the Nevada desert. I first encountered Craven’s work when I developed a childhood obsession with his 1982 adaptation of Swamp Thing. It wasn’t a very good movie — although I can still quote stretches of Louis Jourdan’s overwrought dialogue to this day (""Bruno’s essence was stupidity; timidity. The formula simply extended — amplified — this to ridiculous forms and proportions!""). But there was a certain kind of wondrous, low-budget magical realism in the film that I responded to, and when I discovered A Nightmare on Elm Street Craven became one of my favorite horror filmmakers. Craven's Freddy Krueger was vicious and cruel; the dark underbelly of suburbia  When you talk to people about Freddy Krueger, they usually fall into two camps: those that remember him as the wise-cracking, Roger Moore of horror that actor Robert Englund eventually became, and those that remember him from Craven’s original. Wes Craven’s vision for Krueger was vicious, cruel; a child murderer that represented the dark underbelly of everyday suburban existence. The original Nightmare was inspired by a real-life newspaper story about a child that actually died of fright during a nightmare; Freddy himself came from Craven’s childhood memory of a drunken man in a fedora and sweater lurking outside his house. But it was the sheer invention of the concept itself that sparked something new in the genre. And while Nightmare often got lumped together with Friday the 13th, it became clear that Craven’s academic roots in philosophy, the subconscious, and cultural mythmaking drove his process more than a mere lust for gore.  The genial father figure of horror For those of us that grew up on the genre, Craven became the genial father figure of horror; always soothing and comforting in interviews, thoughtful both about the things he wanted to explore in his films, and the importance of purging societal fears through the arts. That’s what made it so painful to watch over the ensuing decade as his work swung unpredictably from the intriguing (The Serpent and the Rainbow) to the awkward (Deadly Friend) to the desperate (Shocker). But despite the fallow periods, there was no denying that his wild imagination had transformed the genre. Not only did New Line Cinema crank out enough Nightmare sequels to burn people out on the character (Craven only directed two of the nine films in franchise), but studios scrambled to copy the surrealism of Elm Street in hopes of creating their own blockbuster franchises. (My ""favorite"" was something called Brainscan.) With the slasher craze pretty much dead and buried by the early ‘90s, many filmmakers would have moved on to other topics — but Craven, always trying to understand why things scared us, understood that the next item to tackle was our relationship with horror films themselves. His first step into the meta-terrain was New Nightmare, a sequel revolving around the idea that the people that made the Nightmare on Elm Street films were being hunted by a new version of Freddy. But the idea didn’t truly click into place until 1996. Craven found himself responsible for yet another horror renaissance Written by Kevin Williamson, Scream was raucous and fun, a scary movie about scary movies that toyed with the genre’s conventions with a glee Craven hadn’t really shown off before. It was an incredible hit — and just like what had happened 10 years prior, Craven found himself responsible for a new kind of horror renaissance. This time he stayed tied closely to the material, however, directing all four Scream movies and using the leverage of his success to branch out into different genres, trying his hand at drama with Meryl Streep (Music of the Heart) and proving he had straight-ahead thriller chops in 2005’s underrated Red Eye.  Craven was never the most consistent filmmaker, and for every Scream or Nightmare there’s a Cursed or My Soul To Take. But through it all Craven maintained that same welcome, professorial countenance. Always thoughtful and considered; a filmmaker with an affinity for the medium’s great artists, who earnestly tried to bring his best, biggest ideas to the genre in every way he could. His impact only intensified in recent years Looking at his credits now, I admit I’m a little shocked to realize Wes Craven never directed a film after 2011’s Scream 4. According to yesterday’s reports, he’d been quietly battling brain cancer, but he never seemed to be anything but busy — developing some SyFy shows here, adapting a graphic novel there — and the impact of his legacy has only intensified in recent years (there’s no Scream Queens or The Final Girls without Craven). I suppose it’s often that way when you grow up admiring somebody and their work; they’re just always there. But everything’s ephemeral, here for a brief moment and then gone the next. I’m going to miss Wes Craven. I’m going to miss the things I learned from him, and from his movies. We all will, whether we realize it or not.",0.44308937505774326,0.5569106249422567,0.16983171203649397,1198,5.0275459098497493,645,6.3147286821705428,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Essay, Film"

Let us guide you through the upcoming releases, taking a crunchy bite from each game until we find the perfect one for you. By Chris Plante, Andrew Webster, Adi Robertson, Ross Miller, Jamieson Cox, Rich McCormick, Sam Byford, and Chris Ziegler This isn’t the first Metal Gear Solid to be billed as the last, but this time the creators might make good on the promise. Partly because of director Hideo Kojima’s falling out with the series’ developer Konami; partly because Konami seems more interested in slot machines and swimming pools than video games these days. But if The Phantom Pain does turn out to be the series’ swan song, early reviews claim Metal Gear Solid will finish with grace. The eccentric stealth action takes place in an open world for the first time, and trailers to date have cranked up the trademark globe-spanning melodrama. The Phantom Pain will be a must-play for Metal Gear Solid fans, of course. The shift to open-world play might make it more tempting than usual to series novices, too, but they shouldn’t expect to track the plot. Then again, most Metal Gear Solid devotees probably won’t either. And really, they wouldn’t have it any other way. The original Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo Entertainment System is like Game Design 101. Each hurdle, pit, and enemy is introduced in an order that teaches the player a skill, then tests that skill, then mixes and matches the various lessons across increasingly difficult stages. By the final level, an amateur has become an expert, because the game has wordlessly trained them to be nothing less. Barring some exceptional, but unofficial tools on PC, Super Mario Maker will be the first game to let players create their own 2D Super Mario levels. Over the past three decades, Nintendo has been schooling its fans on pacing, design, and structure; now we'll get to apply those skills as creators. Surely this power will be used responsibly, and not as a quick means for creating phallic symbols in a family friendly video game. Avalanche Studios hasn't released a big-budget action game since Just Cause 2 in 2010, despite speaking feverishly about its ambition to be the open-world video game developer of this generation. The rubber will meet the road with Mad Max, a game that has been in and out of development since 2008. Don't let the troubled production dissuade your interest in the game; Mad Max: Fury Road had an even longer and more troubled path to reality, and now half my Twitter feed is adorable fan art. Here's the rub: the game isn't technically inspired by the film. And it's unclear from the promotional trailer and preview videos whether or not the game has the same mash-up of skin-melting action and inspired social commentary. Maybe it will! Or maybe it'll just be a mash-up of Batman-style combat and Just Cause-style car battles, which doesn't sound too bad. Braid was one of the first, and most important, of the new wave of indie games. The two-dimensional, time-manipulating puzzler proved a small team with a big idea could make a hit game on a console. But it takes time. Six years after the initial release of Braid, designer Jonathan Blow is finally ready to release his next project, The Witness. It’s still not entirely clear just what The Witness is, but it appears to be a very different game from Braid. Set on a huge, completely open island that you can explore as you like, its buildings, vegetation, and landscapes are full of puzzles and bits of visual storytelling. Think of it as the modern take on Myst you’ve been waiting for all these years. The fast-paced, neon-laden Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a cooperative game about two people trying to control a giant round spaceship beset by hostile aliens. It’s got the frenetic pace of an Asteroids-style shoot ‘em up, but instead of just hitting buttons and moving joysticks to dodge and attack, you and a partner (or AI) have to jump around the ship to man its many battle stations. Fans of the more strategic spaceship maintenance game FTL will find something thematically familiar here, and there’s a little bit of SpaceTeam in the fast two-player gameplay. Maybe there’s a whole subgenre of games that make you feel like you’re stuck in a Star Wars or Star Trek space battle. Beyond the premise, it’s a creative take on one of the oldest genres in gaming. Forza Motorsport 6 is, contrary to its name, actually the eighth full game in the Forza franchise if you include its two open-world Forza Horizon spinoffs. Over the years, Forza’s mission has been steadfast — a racing simulator with a heavy focus on car count and customization, serving as Microsoft’s direct answer to Sony’s storied Gran Turismo. The latest title in the series learns from Forza 5’s shortcomings, adding weather, nighttime racing, and destructible environments. Like so many sports titles, Forza 6 is accessible to newcomers: you don’t need to know anything about the series to jump right in and start racing. But be warned: unless you can be entertained by driving cars on tracks and doing very little else, the game may not be for you. In an industry where a AAA game often wants to be everything for everyone, Forza is pleased to be the best thing for car fanatics. Bungie’s divisive MMO-FPS hybrid has long been criticized for a lack of content. The Taken King is the developer’s response. The $40 expansion adds more strikes, raid, maps, and a new campaign, but the biggest changes will come with the countless player-friendly tweaks Bungie is making so that defending the galaxy isn’t a mindless chore. Most Destiny addicts will welcome The Taken King with open arms — the $40 price feels steep for an expansion, but Destiny doesn’t charge a subscription fee, and it’s hard to argue with the value proposition in terms of dollars-per-hour. For new players, though, it’s a far better deal — they can pick up the base game, its two previous expansions, and The Taken King all for $60, making it one of the largest games available this year. Soma is the latest — and potentially weirdest — release from indie studio Frictional Games, which horror fans may recognize from the Lovecraftian Penumbra and Amnesia series. Why are you at the bottom of the ocean? What happened to everyone in the Pathos-2 underwater research facility? What are the hunched, glowing things that look like diving suits and hunt like predators? Since the game’s not out yet, we obviously don’t know, but these are the kinds of questions that will presumably be answered. Or they won’t! As Lovecraftian lovers, the developers appreciate the horror of the unknown. The story-driven Soma doesn’t ask you to shoot up monsters or hoard resources or solve complicated logic puzzles, but it’s still not for the faint of heart. Traversing Pathos-2 will mean hiding and running from any mysterious creature that crosses your path, while trying to figure out how to get to your next destination. Expect a combination of jump scares, underwater exploration, and cerebral science fiction. The original Persona 4 has become a cult classic among role-playing fans for good reason. It managed to combine a small town murder mystery with typical high school drama, and somehow made it work within the confines of a fairly traditional Japanese RPG. So it only makes sense to follow that up with a music game. Dancing All Night features the same cast of characters, but in a completely different context. You’re still fighting shadowy monsters, but this time you’re using the power of dance to ward them off, instead of your combat skills. It’s a silly departure, but given Persona 4’s wonderful soundtrack and unforgettable cast of characters, it’s also one that could work. Plus, your Vita is really desperate for something new to play. You remember Vita, right? That thing sitting in your sock drawer. Go give it a hug. Animal Crossing is the game series we most want to live in. We relish performing menial tasks around its fictional small towns, helping personified animals solve countless pedestrian problems. It’s like real life, except colorful, safe, and everything we do is incrementally rewarded. Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer is a spinoff that focuses on the interior and exterior designs of the cartoonish homes. With some of the limitations removed from Animal Crossing’s traditional sell-buy-sell story progression, the player can spend large sums decorating homes to please lovable residents. With more creative freedom from the get go, it may be an even more welcoming entry point to one of Nintendo’s most charmed worlds. It’s hard to imagine a better fit for the ever-expanding toys-to-life genre — games like the Skylanders and Disney Infinity franchises that incorporate real-world toys into their video game worlds — than LEGO. The company’s massive catalog of original universes and licensed properties already spans both physical toys and video games: it was only a matter of time before it found a way to unite the two. LEGO Dimensions mashes characters from dozens of different fictional realms into the same universe. If you want to a build a super-team consisting of Batman, Gandalf, Marty McFly, Homer Simpson, and Emmet from The LEGO Movie, this is the game for you. LEGO plans to support the game with expansions and level packs for at least a year post-release, so nervous buyers can rest assured there will be more to play, and anxious parents can tremble knowing there will be more to buy. While the potential damage to the family budget may scare away some parents who’ve already littered their house with similar toys, consider this: the chance to pit Gollum and Wonder Woman against each other in heated combat. How can any self-respecting comic book shop frequenter resist? A few years ago, we saw a tech demonstration at a New York City art museum in which a green blob traveled across a wasteland by splitting and rebuilding itself. It had the pleasure of bubble wrap, and the thoughtfulness of a platforming puzzle game. This fall, it will be released as a full-fledged video game called Mushroom 11. We know many relatives and friends who don’t play many games, but enjoy mobile distractions like the hit World of Goo. Mushroom 11 should be their latest, unexpected video game fixation. It’s easy to learn, immediately enjoyable to play, and the green goo is adorable — despite having no discernible emotions. Plus, few people have heard about Mushroom 11, so when it becomes a surprise hit, you can grin and say you played it before it was cool. Developed by the company that created the original Guitar Hero, Rock Band expanded the concept of a rock star rhythm game to include drums, vocals, and bass. It saw a panoply of sequels and spinoffs for specific bands like The Beatles, but the last major title was released five years ago followed by a slide in interest in plastic instruments. Rock Band 4 will refresh the series for a new generation of consoles. This means more songs, new fancy plastic guitars and drum kits, and a focus on ""freestyle"" performances that let you improvise along with songs instead of just recreating them. Where the new Guitar Hero Live is trying to revamp rhythm games and the plastic used to play them, Rock Band 4 is shaping up to be a gentler, more party-friendly alternative. If you had fun staying up late with your friends and playing the video game version of air guitar, it’s an easy time to get back into the series — if you still have your old instruments from a previous game around, they should even work with it. Developer Harmonix hopes to release new songs and features over time instead of putting out a sequel right away. If you’re a PS4 owner petrified that you won’t be able to catch up on the Nathan Drake saga before it wraps with Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, fear not: Sony and Naughty Dog have a solution. Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection is a standard next-gen port in terms of enhancements — a little bit of graphical polish, a superior resolution and frame rate, new modes and trophies — but it’s notable for two reasons. First, it squeezes all three of the Uncharted games released on PS3 — 2007’s Drake’s Fortune, 2009’s Among Thieves, and 2011’s Drake’s Deception — into one beefy package. Second, buyers will gain entry into A Thief’s End’s multiplayer beta when it’s released (the date hasn’t been announced yet). This might be enough to render The Nathan Drake Collection a worthy purchase for neophytes and die-hards alike. Who doesn’t like video games where everything is made of yarn? (We look over the audience, and see no one has raised their hand.) Good, because Nintendo has constructed the latest installment in its Yoshi series of platforming games with the frizzy material of homemade Christmas presents. Yoshi’s Woolly World stars a threaded version of the titular green dinosaur and boasts various yarn-themed elements, like yarn balls that let Yoshi knit a path forward or secrets that can be found by unraveling a level. Yoshi’s Woolly World will have a built-in base of existing Nintendo fans, and the cute look will surely entice at least one or two yarn enthusiasts. (We look over the audience and realize everyone is actually just a gang of cats. No wonder y’all are so excited about yarn!) It’s also got some extra features for anyone who’s invested in Nintendo’s Amiibo toys. Placing a Yoshi figurine on the Wii U’s GamePad controller will import a bonus Yoshi into the game, and other Amiibos will unlock new themes based on characters like Mario or Samus Aran. In 2005, Guitar Hero sold players a simple plastic guitar controller and the fantasy of being a rock star. One decade and over a dozen titles later, it’s building upon that formula with a new generation of live-action music videos. Guitar Hero Live has replaced computer graphics with ‘90s-style full-motion video, and it’s launching with an MTV-style 24-hour music channel running videos to play along with. Guitar Hero Live might be more complicated than the Guitar Hero you remember — its new controller adds dual rows of buttons that look a lot like frets, players will want to tune into the music channel at specific times for their favorite musical genres, and there’s a system of earning (or buying) points for premium songs. But the other way of thinking about Guitar Hero Live is as a great flattening of fake rockstar skills. It’s the first meaningful revamp of one of the best rhythm games of all time, making it a new experience for just about everyone. The Assassin’s Creed series is an incredibly complex science fictional saga about genetic memory retrieval, millennia-old conspiracies, virtual reality, and… okay, look, no one really cares about that. Assassin’s Creed is like the multitemporal version of that Full Metal Jacket quote: do parkour runs through exotic, exciting time periods; meet interesting historical figures; and stab them while wearing a stylish cloak. This time around, you’re fighting gang wars in Victorian London, with new technological touches like a grappling hook and a sword cane. A Victorian Assassin’s Creed — the most modern time period so far — has been on some people’s wish lists for quite some time. If you’re not sold on the gameplay, the entire series is still consistently beautiful, priding itself on detailed and (relatively) historically accurate cityscapes in places like Paris and Jerusalem. Syndicate will include a playable female character, even if she’s sharing a spotlight with the primary male protagonist. Unfortunately, last year’s Assassin’s Creed Unity suffered from crippling and sometimes hilarious technical problems at launch, so some caution might be in order for Syndicate. We are human; we are doomed to be endlessly fixated on what is just out of reach. Countless Wii U owners are waiting for the next big console Legend of Zelda— an open-world game that was a disappointing no-show at E3 2015. The primarily cooperative Tri Force Heroes, though, is right around the corner. Instead of an epic story, it’s a puzzle-based 3DS game meant for three people (all playing as Link). Players will need to coordinate everything from their actions to their outfits to succeed. If you’re desperate for some new Zelda, this is an obvious choice. It’s also a stand-alone puzzle game that should be accessible to most people with a 3DS, but without an established loyalty to the series. The optimal experience might be sitting on the couch with two friends, but there’s an online multiplayer option where players communicate with built-in gestures instead of voice chat. If you don’t want to deal with multiplayer at all, there’s always the option to play alone, controlling all the Links yourself. It’s not the next big Zelda, but that’s okay. May we be so fortunate to experience the present. Halo 5: Guardians is the first new Halo game to hit the Xbox One, following last year’s compendium of Halo: Combat Evolved through Halo 4: The Master Chief Collection. The story follows Halo 4, with Spartan Locke tracking Master Chief, and will be playable via four-player co-op. The Halo mythos may intimidate newcomers, but the cooperative campaign, multiplayer mode, flashy graphics, and comparatively cartoonish violence make it one of the more accessible first-person shooters to be released this fall. Microsoft supports the Halo games long after release, making it — along with Destiny and Call of Duty — a game that could last deep into 2016. We at The Verge play each annually released Call of Duty game, and even we’re disoriented by the series. Black Ops 3 takes place in the future, but not in the same future as Call of Duty: Ghosts, Modern Warfare, or Advanced Warfare. The Black Ops series set itself apart by taking place in the past, but it’s unclear if the past will be present this time around. But there are robotics and super soldiers and fear of a robot takeover, and as we read that aloud, we realize that sounds nothing like a Call of Duty game. Perhaps that’s the joy of Call of Duty at this point. It’s now just a brand that stands for a certain scope and quality, and can be placed onto any setting or plot. Hopefully Black Ops 3 distinguishes itself from its cousins. And if it doesn’t, there’s always reliably enjoyable multiplayer and the Zombies mode, which will feature the vocal stylings of Jeff Goldblum. Yo-kai Watch is probably the most popular game you’ve never heard of. It’s sold millions of copies, spawned multiple sequels and a popular anime, and it has enough merchandise to make Pikachu jealous. Problem is, up until now it’s only been available in Japan. Nintendo will be publishing the Level-5-developed game in North America this year, bringing what could be the next Pokemon-style phenomenon to the region. Like that series, Yo-kai Watch is a fairly straightforward RPG, but one where you use a magical watch to uncover hidden creatures that others can’t see. It’s also just plain adorable, so if you love Pokemon, it’ll very likely be your next obsession. Rise of the Tomb Raider is the sequel to Crystal Dynamics’ successful 2012 Tomb Raider reboot, which transformed the old-school action-adventure series into a breakneck blockbuster. Xbox chief Phil Spencer hasn’t been shy about positioning Rise of the Tomb Raider as his console’s answer to Sony’s Uncharted series. (The game is exclusive to Xbox One for a limited window.) And it’s true: for Xbox One owners looking for their fix of treasure hunting adventure, this is the closest thing you’ll find to Uncharted on the console. But it’d be selling the series short to view it solely as an imitator; 2012’s Tomb Raider was a hugely accomplished game in its own right, with excellent pacing, strong world-building, and surprisingly solid combat. The world is a wasteland, and you must scavenge, claw, and steal to survive. But don’t worry, because Fallout 4 is out this November! Bethesda’s vast RPG casts you as a survivor of a catastrophic nuclear war, freed from an underground bunker to roam the wilds around Boston some 200 years after the bombs fell. Now inhabited by zombie-faced ghouls, irradiated rodents, and worse — other humans — you’ll need to shoot, loot, and chat your way through hundreds of darkly comic quests. Fallout is surprisingly welcoming to those turned off by the joyless stories of other post-apocalyptic video games. Fallout 4 borrows the color palette of its predecessors, painting the nuclear wasteland in muted browns and greens, but adds a slate of new features. A detailed weapon-crafting system means you’ll be able to cobble the gun of your dreams, and salvaging wreckage from the wastes will allow you to build yourself a house and defend it with automated gun turrets. It’s a good thing you’ll have somewhere to stay in the game — if it’s anything like Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4 will swallow players for months on end. EA’s upcoming Battlefront is to your Star Wars fantasies what the publisher’s long-running Battlefield series is to your regular war fantasies. Like Battlefield, Battlefront is a multiplayer shooter that pits two teams of soldiers against each other, but unlike Battlefield, the action takes place in a galaxy far far away. Where Battlefield lets you drive tanks and APCs, Battlefront gives you the keys to X-Wings and AT-ATs, allowing you to relive fights from the movies, like the Empire Strikes Back’s battle of Hoth, over and over again. It’s a game designed explicitly for Star Wars fans who dream about being on the ground (or air) in the franchise's most iconic scrimmages. The game draws on the classic trilogy for its settings, but also bridges the 30-year gap between Return of the Jedi and the new films: Star Wars obsessives will want to join the Imperial or Rebel forces to see the battle of Jakku, a fight that Episode VII director J.J. Abrams says is pivotal in the freshly rebuilt Star Wars canon. Fortunately, you won’t need to be deep into the expanded universe to enjoy Battlefront: the game’s massive and messy multiplayer combat looks suitably cinematic even if you don’t know your AT-AT from your Endor. Brace yourself for ""do a barrel roll"" memes,  Star Fox is back for the first time in nearly a decade. Star Fox Zero isn’t reinventing the series’ trademark space combat — it’s supposed to feel similar to Star Fox 64, and recycles many of that game’s locations and beloved sidekicks. Instead, it’s framing the familiar action within the Wii U’s gamepad. Players will operate Fox McCloud’s Arwing from the cockpit using the gamepad, freeing up their big screens for a more dynamic look at the action. Nintendo is positioning Star Fox Zero as a major showcase for the GamePad’s capabilities, one that can stand alongside games like Splatoon and Super Mario Maker.The gamble might not pay off, but the world of Star Fox has the potential to make a great foundation for a GamePad-based shooter if Nintendo can work out the kinks from early previews. How big is the Mario brand? The tennis spinoff — Mario Tennis, naturally — is on its seventh iteration. Like Mario Party, Mario Golf, and Mario Paint, the series takes an established sport or hobby, seals it in a Ziplock bag full of Super Mario mythos, gives the code plenty of time to marinate, then plates and garnishes each new serving with some hand-selected features. This time, Mario Tennis will feature more power-ups, including the ability to grow characters so that they consume nearly a quarter of the court. If you’re thinking, Wait, didn’t they do that already, well, you’re not alone. Mario Tennis is unlikely to attract Wii U holdouts to the console, and if it's tennis simulation you want, obviously look elsewhere. But it does further solidify the Wii U as the most consistent home for local multiplayer games in a time where playing with friends on a couch is the feature most likely to get cut from big-budget titles. It’s tennis. It’s Mario. It’s an easy way to get your friends who haven’t played video games in years to grab a controller and have a little fun. The Just Cause series deserves to be in the same conversations about ambitious open-world games as Grand Theft Auto. What Just Cause lacks in precision — its cities aren’t compulsive replications of recognizable neighborhoods and landmarks, its animation and AI aren’t so poured over as to make sure a cat reacts properly to a suburban fire fight — the series makes up for in messy, unpredictable chaos. It can be just as spectacular, jaw-dropping, and well frankly garish as its better-known contemporary. Just Cause 3, we suspect, will click with a larger audience than its predecessor, in some part because Just Cause 2 continues to be the material of zany, popular internet videos that provide hours of free promotion. But we also believe Just Cause 3 is arriving in a period of gaming that values creativity and freedom more than the cinematic, guided corridors of previous generations. Its creators have been boastful about the opportunity to blow up practically everything in the game’s tropical setting. Plenty of open-world games fill the market, but Just Cause 3 reminds us that what’s more valuable than an open world is freedom to engage with it. The Rainbow Six games have always been more tactically minded than their shooter peers, and Siege is no exception. Rather than the bombastic breach-and-clears of games like Call of Duty, Ubisoft’s FPS demands that players plan their approach into enemy-held territory, taking things slow in order to avoid a messy death. The game’s Terrorist Hunt mode fills a map with foes, demanding precision and teamwork, while a new multiplayer option assigns players to either the terrorist or counterterrorist faction. The former are holed up inside a building and need to hold out, while the latter are on the outside, trying to get in without too many casualties. Siege appears to be the thinking-person’s first-person shooter, though it doesn’t sacrifice the wanton demolition of similar games. A terrain destruction model means you’ll need to watch out for bullets flying through walls, doors, and floors, but both sides have a set of gadgets they’ll be able to deploy to keep them out of the line of fire. If players get the tools to devise their own cunning plans, and the game’s guns feel as good as they did in predecessor Rainbow Six: Vegas, then Siege could be the antidote to the typically stupid shooter. Fresh off an attempt to neck-stab the movie industry with another dry thriller, Agent 47 is leaping back into the world of games with Hitman, the sixth main entry in the long-running stealth series. Developer IO Interactive is approaching the game with renewed ambition and new technical power, and it’s hoping to achieve the same sort of ""stealth sandbox"" feel that characterizes Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. It’s also promising to keep the game interesting with new missions and areas, some of which will only be available for a limited time. The agent’s recent cinematic gambit may have been widely maligned, but he’s delivered reliable and capable excitement as a video game protagonist for well over a decade now. If you like sneaking around and solving puzzles with blades and bullets, Hitman should do a fine job satisfying those urges. All that’s left is the announcement of a game version of The Verge’s own take on the Hitman mythos, Hitman: Bloodtribution. Hey, I’d preorder it! Role-playing games tend to send you to far flung fantasy worlds, filled with swords and magic and monsters to fight. The Xenoblade series does that to, but it also takes place in a sci-fi future where robotic aliens have taken over the planet. The first game was a cult hit on the original Wii, and spawned an excellent port for the 3DS. But Xenoblade Chronicle X is the first proper follow-up. Like the original, X lets you explore absolutely massive, open environments and do battle against towering alien creatures. The combat is much more action-oriented compared to most Japanese RPGs, but the biggest change is the chance to pilot a mech suit. Since it’s billed as a ""spiritual successor"" and not a straight sequel, X should be approachable to anyone looking for a good RPG, even if you missed the original. And in a genre that tends to be overly cautious, with games that can feel very similar to one another, the Xenoblade series stands apart thanks to its epic scale and fluid combat. Persona is one of the few Japanese RPG franchises that still engenders enthusiasm in the West. The series has managed to carve out its own niche by blending a dark dungeon crawler with surprisingly deep high school drama. By day you have to worry over exams and that student you have a crush on, but night is all about fighting terrifying shadow creatures. Persona 3 dealt with an after-school, monster-hunting team, while 4 was all about solving a series of murders in a small town. The next adventure is still somewhat of a mystery, but it involves a group of high school kids who also pull off Ocean’s Eleven-style heists in their time off. Plus, it has a talking cat.

From the first release in 2013, the premise has been appetizing for Disney fans: combine characters from properties ranging from The Incredibles to Pirates of the Caribbean, and throw them together in a virtual toy box where you can essentially build whatever you like. Add in some real life collectible toys that can be scanned into the game, just like with Skylanders, and you have a recipe for success. Unfortunately, across its first two releases, the Infinity series has left much to be desired — it can be needlessly complicated, and the actual game elements aren't always that fun. But the latest game in the series improves on the formula quite a bit. And the best changes stem from the inclusion of Star Wars characters and worlds. Here are the most important new additions and tweaks. Disney Infinity games are essentially divided into two main sections: the creative toy box, where you can build your own game using all kinds of tools and toys, and play sets, story-driven campaigns based on a specific Disney property. In the past, the play sets have been almost uniformly boring, with dull missions and uninspired level design. To make matters worse, you were forced to play through the play sets to unlock toys for the toy box.   Disney Infinity 3.0 ships with a new Star Wars-themed play set called ""Twilight of the Republic,"" and it’s a huge improvement. It’s set during the Clone Wars period, and it’s almost like a short, kid-friendly open-world game. You’ll be cutting down waves of battle droids with a lightsaber, piloting ships around Star Destroyers, and visiting everywhere from Tatooine to Coruscant. While you don’t have complete freedom like in, say, Grand Theft Auto, you’re still able to explore the planets quite a bit; I spent a bunch of time just scaling buildings in Coruscant, so I could really enjoy the view. It’s much more like a fleshed-out video game than past play sets, and the game is full of iconic locations like the Sarlacc pit. Really the only problem I had was the short length — I finished it in around four hours. You still have to play it to unlock toy box content, but at least it's fun. More play sets are on the way, including ""Rise Against the Empire,"" which introduces characters from the original trilogy later this month. Unfortunately, it’ll cost you $34.99 for the new campaign and two figures. The Infinity series is developed by Disney-owned Avalanche Software, but for version 3.0 the studio enlisted some help from other developers. Among them is Ninja Theory, the studio behind action games like Enslaved and DmC: Devil May Cry. The combat has benefited greatly. Playing as any of the Star Wars characters, whether it’s Yoda or Ahsoka, feels really good; the lightsaber combat in particular is great, but there are also some cool force moves to play with.   The combat still works just fine for younger players, since you can mash the attack button and still be relatively successful, but there’s also a combo system with depth if you feel like digging in — you can even unlock new abilities for each character using a simplified skill tree system. It makes lightsaber combat fun without getting too complex, and it leads to some really enjoyable boss fights against Darth Maul and General Grievous. The improvements are especially noticeable if you go back and play as some of the older characters. After completing the campaign, I spent some time in the toy box playing as Venom from version 2.0, and it felt clunky and limited. The Star Wars characters move better and have more abilities, and it’s not just the force-wielding Jedi either — Clone Wars star Sabine Wren and her dual blasters are just as entertaining as the lightsaber wielders. Vehicles have always been a big part of the Infinity games; my favorite toy box activity is building elaborate race tracks. But Mr. Incredible’s car just isn’t on the same level as the Millennium Falcon. Infinity 3.0 introduces a wide range of Star Wars vehicles to pilot, including spaceships and land vehicles. The ""Twilight of the Republic"" play set does an excellent job of introducing them. There’s a lot of space combat.   You’ll do some podracing.   And a chase sequence lets you experience the joys of Coruscant traffic.   Outside of the play set, you can buy all kinds of ships and vehicles to mess around with in the toy box, whether it’s the Millennium Falcon or Slave 1. I, meanwhile, used the game as a way to see whether Anakin’s podracer could outrun a Tron lightcycle. (The answer is yes, yes it can.) One of the best things about the Infinity games is the art style: this is a world where characters like Mickey Mouse and Jack Sparrow look at home alongside each other. This remained true with the introduction of Marvel characters in the second game, and the new Star Wars characters look equally comfortable in the virtual toy box. In fact, they're probably the best-designed characters to be featured in the series; they not only look great in game, but they also make for the best Infinity figures yet.  But it’s more than just the characters — the Star Wars locations you’ll be exploring have been rendered in the slightly cartoony Infinity style. It can be a bit empty at times — I was disappointed to find the Mos Eisley cantina completely deserted — but I spent more than a few minutes enjoying the view. The space battles are especially impressive — huge fights, with lots of ships, framed by a beautiful planet in the background. You can’t use a lightsaber on Jar Jar Binks, who appears in the ""Twilight of the Republic"" play set. Trust me, I tried. But out in the toy box, you can at least get some manner of revenge on everyone’s least favorite Star Wars character.   If you really loathed the previous games, version 3.0 probably won't change your mind. It still has problems — the camera can be annoying at times, for instance, and most of the toy box is still frustratingly locked at the outset of the game. It's also still an expensive game; the starter pack is $64.99, additional play sets are $34.99, and individual characters are $13.99. Those costs can really add up, especially over the course of three games (characters from older versions will work with Disney Infinity 3.0, but not vice versa). But even with those issues, this is easily the best version of Disney Infinity yet. Adding Star Wars is more than just an aesthetic change, or a way to sell more toys (although I definitely want to buy more of these toys). It fundamentally improves the game, giving you more things to do and more fun ways to do them. Disney Infinity 3.0 is available now on the Wii U, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.",0.6617990796733787,0.3382009203266213,0.15909866937710432,1185,4.7434599156118145,569,6.0105448154657291,0,12,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Games Review"

Did it happen when he reappeared and was hoisted into the air to finish singing his new single ""What Do You Mean?"" like a finely coiffed little angel? What about the lingering shot of Bieber sobbing post-performance, trying to find his composure while host / glittery hellion Miley Cyrus yammered on about defiling his person? I'm still trying to pinpoint the instant at which the forgiveness of Bieber's sins, real or imagined, provoked my eyes into rolling so hard it gave me a headache. Bieber's performance of ""Where Are Ü Now"" and ""What Do You Mean?"" was designed with a transition in mind, namely his move from a vague commercial purgatory into legitimate adult pop stardom. It was successful in that regard: he sounded strong, danced capably, and demonstrated his ability to fill a niche wherein the sound and style of contemporary dance music is translated into mass-market pop. But the performance also marked the moment where the seams on Bieber's year of public penitence began to show, and it found him crossing the thin line separating genuine apology and robotic, unfeeling appeasement. Bieber's interest in personal salvation is the most interesting thing about his career in 2015 — but it's his music that's going to determine his fate.  At this point, the rise, fall, and myth of Justin Bieber are part of pop history: a baby-faced teen is plucked from the wilds of southwestern Ontario thanks to a series of adorable YouTube cover videos, and he becomes a star. The new idol is poisoned by his rapid ascent: he becomes bratty, arrogant, and toxic. He's arrested for DUIs and sued by angry neighbors every few months; he's punched out by Orlando Bloom in Ibiza, a sentence no entertainment professional will ever tire of writing. His descent into villainy climaxes with the greatest deposition video ever recorded. By the end of 2014, he's universally viewed as an entitled, unrepentant shithead. This year, something changed: Bieber decided to convince the world he's become a good person. That's the mode in which he's spent the entirety of 2015. From all angles, Bieber's redemptive arc is unnecessary I'm willing to hear a number of arguments surrounding Bieber's motivations. He might have undergone some true change, one driven by his faith and a few years as the butt of every joke. He may have been cajoled into a rebrand by handlers and friends worried about his behavior's ultimate impact on their bank accounts. (I think it's probably a bit of both.) But from both a musical and commercial perspective, Bieber's redemptive arc — the one that climaxed last night with that bit of post-show sobbing — was unnecessary. The most important part of his impending return to pop respectability is his music, not his personality: it needs to be good, and it needs to make use of the tremendous institutional force Bieber has at his disposal. His ""return to form"" is that simple, and it has nothing to do with his personal ""journey,"" his miscreant past, or his conspicuous displays of emotion. It's not like Bieber hasn't made top-tier pop music in the past. The singles cut from 2012's Believe — ""Boyfriend,"" ""As Long As You Love Me,"" and the Nicki Minaj feature ""Beauty and a Beat"" — all peaked within Billboard's top 10, and deserved to do so; three years later, they encapsulate a specific moment in pop where a specific subgenre, dubstep, was exerting undue influence on the sound of music. Journals, a compilation of free singles released at the end of 2013, was even more compelling — a tight and focused vision of wispy, overtly sexual alt-R&B. It would've been a worthy listen from some Brooklyn-based indie darling; from one of the world's most prominent musicians, it was a fascinating and surprising move. The album wasn't a victim of commercial marginalization, either: almost every song from Journals charted without a formal release or much promotion, getting there on the pure strength of Bieber's fanbase and some word-of-mouth among pleasantly surprised, open listeners. Subscribing to a narrative that Bieber was creatively and commercially destitute before begging Ellen DeGeneres for forgiveness means pretending Journals doesn't exist; talking about ""What Do You Mean?"" like it's his first ""grown and sexy"" moment ignores his last three years of work. If you stripped all of the nicety from Bieber c. 2015, nothing would change If you stripped away every bit of penitence and nicety from the Bieber of 2015, nothing would change. He'd still be charting highly, and he'd still be earning tons of positive press, but they'd be framed around some perceived difference in musical quality rather than a personal transformation. ""Where Are Ü Now"" still sounds like a transmission from the near future after months of constant radio play, and it's being dissected by no less a publication than The New York Times. ""What Do You Mean?"" hops onto the wave of tropical house just as it's commercially cresting. They're good songs, and Bieber is using the immense infrastructural might he's accrued over the last near-decade to ensure they reach their potential. With that said, Bieber's naked, calculated plays for everyone's adoration are actually endangering his blooming ""comeback."" The music industry is fickle and volatile, and it wouldn't take much for Bieber to tip from redemption into commercially-motivated insincerity — one more tearful moment, maybe, or a particularly saccharine talk show appearance. At this point, the smartest thing he can do is step back from all of his choreographed personal talking points in order to focus on the quality and refinement of his upcoming album. And if he needs evidence that a re-emergence need not be apologetic, he doesn't have to look far: his countryman and fellow VMA performer Abel Tesfaye — better known as The Weeknd — proved that point about half an hour before Bieber took the stage himself. Tesfaye's never been as prominent as Bieber, but he's spent much of this year making a comeback of his own, one necessitated by the anemic reception bestowed upon his 2013 full-length debut Kiss Land. His struggles didn't have to do with antics — antics are half the point when it comes to The Weeknd, who inhabits a world of drug-fueled orgies and regrettable decisions — but they took place all the same. His road to pop superstardom didn't involve a promise to change or a departure from his trademark lechery: he brought in some of the best songwriters in the world, used them to amplify his existing gifts, and ended up becoming a star on his own terms. Bieber needs to stop atoning for his sins His rendition of ""Can't Feel My Face"" was the performance of the night thanks to an incredible vocal take and a surprising degree of showmanship. It had everyone in the audience dancing — even Kanye. You can argue that Bieber's fans are more invested in qualities like purity and honesty than people who listen to The Weeknd, but fans can grow up, and you can always find new ones. (I'm also sure that Beliebers would still be swearing fealty and running social media campaigns even if their Justin wasn't trying to become an angel reborn.) If Bieber really wants to cement his status as a pop force, he needs to worry less about atoning for his sins and more about maintaining his musical momentum.",0.4575024259496482,0.5424975740503518,0.6731596990597467,1294,4.9536321483771255,676,6.3417159763313613,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Essay, Music, VMA 2015 "

Well, it's starting to. Google says the new app will begin its rollout slowly with a small batch of users before reaching most Android phones (with NFC) running Android 4.4 KitKat or above within the next week. If you already have Google Wallet installed on your device, you'll soon be seeing an update that morphs that app into Android Pay. Google has re-released Google Wallet as a separate app now focused strictly on payments between friends and family like Square Cash and Venmo. Loyalty programs, gift cards, and offers previously stored in Wallet will now automatically move over to Android Pay. Just like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, Android Pay allows you to make contactless payments using your smartphone  at participating retailers. Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover cards from banks including Bank of America, US Bank, PNC, and others can be added to Android Pay starting today. Citi and Wells Fargo will begin supporting the platform within the next few days. Similar to Apple, Google says it'll be adding to the roster of banks and compatible credit / debit cards ""all the time."" One thing to note: if you’ve been using Google Wallet to tap and pay, there’s a chance that you’ll lose that ability with Android Pay until your individual bank is supported. This owes to the product's security measures; Android Pay is safer to use, but it requires involvement from Google's partners instead of linking any old debit card to your account. Google's list of participating banks is shorter than Apple's, but more are coming Since Android Pay and Apple Pay both take advantage of NFC technology, the list of stores and restaurants accepting Google's app resembles what we initially saw from Apple; McDonald's, Subway, Whole Foods, Walgreens, Rite Aid, Staples, GameStop, and others are taking Android Pay right away, with more retailers due in the weeks to come.   Google says that for right now, Android Pay will be limited to tap-to-pay purchases at physical stores. The other half of the platform, which allows consumers to buy things within Android apps, isn't yet ready to launch. That'll be coming ""later this year,"" but Google isn't specifying exactly when.   Security Google and Apple also share a similar approach to security with their mobile wallet platforms. Android Pay uses tokenization to keep your actual credit or debit card number hidden from merchants. Instead, they see a virtual account number, and Google says your sensitive payment data is stored securely on compatible Android devices — but the company couldn't tell me exactly where. Samsung insists its own payments solution is both more versatile (true) and more secure than Android Pay. Recent transactions (plus a merchant's address and phone number) are listed for easy reference, and if you've lost your phone and are concerned about fraudulent payments, Android Device Manager can reset your password or wipe the device remotely. Tinkerers should also be warned that installing custom ROMs on Android devices or unlocking a smartphone's bootloader may render it incompatible with Android Pay. Specifically, Google told me that Android Pay is ""not designed to work on rooted devices."" Android Pay will come preloaded on phones One thing Google can count on is major support from three major US carriers. Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile will soon preload Android Pay on all smartphones running Android Lollipop and above. (Sprint customers are free to download and install Android Pay, but it won't come on phones out of the box.) That's a pretty significant benefit for Google in the mobile wallet war against Apple and Samsung. Retail workers at carrier stores have been trained to help customers get familiar with Android Pay upon purchasing a new phone. One carrier may even cut out or delay Samsung's option; Verizon Wireless continues to remain silent about whether or not it will support Samsung Pay when it launches in the United States later this month. But if Android Pay is the payments platform you're getting behind, you'll be able to try it starting today. Google says it ""would prefer"" that users wait for the app to appear in Google Play before getting started, but nothing's stopping you from manually sideloading Android Pay onto your phone right now.",0.6952633782961122,0.3047366217038878,0.9137793647860408,737,5.0637720488466753,403,5.9826302729528535,0,4,"Apps, Google, Mobile, Tech, Breaking"

The small American company, which makes its money by selling an iPad stylus called the Pencil, saw Apple announce an iPad stylus also called the Pencil. The good news, though, is that FiftyThree had some advance warning about this incoming threat, having worked with Apple on making its Paper drawing app compatible with the new Pencil model. That's given the team time to consider its best response and, aside from aiming to attract new Apple Pencil users to its software, the company will also broaden out the compatibility of its own Pencil, starting with the iPhone. Released today as a free download from the App Store, Paper 3.0 brings a major update to the interface and is now finally available for iPhone as well as iPad users. The app doesn't require the physical Pencil stylus to work, and brings with a new focus on visual note-taking that should make it compelling even without extra hardware. I was given a walkthrough of the new software by FiftyThree boss Georg Petschnigg, who introduced it by saying that ""Paper's always been about where ideas begin."" The thinking and design behind the new app was driven by how people capture ideas on their phones. FiftyThree Paper for iPhone photosPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext The most obvious feature that any note-taking app requires is speed. That's why the Paper interface has an almost omnipresent ""+"" button at the bottom of the screen, which gets you into the note creation tool immediately. From there, you can tap out a text note as usual, with easy — not intuitive, but very fast once you learn them — lateral swipes allowing you to format text and create bulleted lists on the fly. Alternatively, you can sketch something, using the full suite of Paper tools (which used to be an in-app purchase, but were made free for all in February), or use the camera to snap a photo. An excellent app, even without the Pencil Images, says Petschnigg, ""have become actually one of the most commonly used ways that people capture their ideas on the go,"" and so the new Paper app allows you to quickly sketch on top of pictures or highlight particular areas of interest. The really neat thing is how these three input modes are automatically integrated: I can put together a grocery shopping list in the text editor, photograph my empty fridge with the camera, and annotate where all the fresh produce will go once I complete the task of going to the store. It all just flows very naturally. Navigating between your Paper-ed ideas is done via a series of free-floating ""spaces,"" which are essentially sticky note boards, ""but without the sticky."" Pinching to zoom is an important interaction here, and it serves as a substitute for a back button: if you keep zooming out, you'll exit your current note to view the space it is in, and from there eventually end up on your home screen, which gives you an overview of your spaces and stacks up all the note cards. It's a friendly interface, if somewhat unruly.   FiftyThree's goal with this new app is to replace a bunch of others you might already be using on your phone. If you keep lists in one place, written notes in another, and a bunch of inspiration photos in your camera roll, then Paper wants to lighten your app load and take care of all of them in one spot. It certainly makes sense if you subscribe to the company's premise that ideas should all be collated together, no matter their type or format. I'm not entirely convinced that the gesture-heavy interface adopted by Paper is quite as swift and intuitive as the company claims, but it certainly does an impressive job of streamlining the process of recording information in a fast and easy way. Perhaps the most underwhelming part of the new Paper app on the iPhone is actually its interaction with the Pencil. It functions perfectly well, but the limited size of the 4.7-inch iPhone's screen made for a cramped experience. The Pencil has a rather flabby rubber tip that makes precise input difficult, and I was left feeling far less in control of the stuff I was drawing than while using my fingertip. Perhaps the larger 5.5-inch iPhone Plus models would fare better in this respect, though I personally feel like anything smaller than, say, the iPad mini just wouldn't benefit much from the use of this stylus. Android compatibility is coming, eventually Using the Pencil on the iPhone has left me unimpressed, however the Paper app itself marks a fine update and an overdue arrival on Apple's flagship smartphone. FiftyThree's Petschnigg tells me that the company's ""business model is still to sell the hardware,"" and its Pencil is ""the market share leader in the digital stylus market now."" In order to keep that momentum going, FiftyThree might need to introduce a more phone-friendly version of its stylus, while also expanding to other platforms like Android tablets. Petschnigg notes that FiftyThree has already listed a job opening for an Android engineer, so if you want to see Paper supported on your non-iPad device, the opportunity is there to go and make it happen.",0.6535877572812119,0.3464122427187881,0.16277576181992823,901,4.8213096559378465,468,6.0576923076923075,0,2,"Apple, Apps, Mobile, Tech, Hands-on"

Update: Read the iPhone 6S review. Given that the 16GB entry-level model will retail for $649, that's some solid savings — provided you're open to T-Mobile, of course. The carrier also has its usual offer of paying customers up to $650 for any costs they incur getting out of their contracts with their current carrier.

Ellen Pao announced today she has dropped her lawsuit against her former employer, the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Pao's gender discrimination suit, which she lost in a jury trial in March, touched off debate on the underrepresentation of women in Silicon Valley; it also unveiled the inner workings of one of the Valley's most storied VC firms. ""I feel gratified that my actions have encouraged others to speak up about discrimination in venture capital and technology more broadly,"" Pao wrote in a statement obtained first by Recode. ""I am encouraged that companies are taking more action to quantify and address the disparity of opportunities for women and minorities."" Pao will pay almost $276,000 in legal fees to Kleiner Perkins Many people who’ve criticized the treatment of women in tech — and especially the treatment of women who speak out about discriminatory workplace practices — considered Pao’s March loss a blow. Pao remained vigilant, however, and told a crowd in May at Recode's Code Conference that the industry would improve its treatment of women in the workplace if more people told their stories. Pao was considering an appeal and filed a notice in June indicating her intent, but appears not to have followed through due to extreme financial burden it would impose. Backlash against Pao on the internet eventually coalesced into a campaign to get her fired as the interim CEO of Reddit. Pao stepped down as chief executive of the social network in July amid disputes over the site's hosting of controversial forums. Pao did not settle with Kleiner Perkins because she didn’t want to be prevented from speaking about the case, she said. ""Settlement might have provided me with financial benefits, but only at the great cost of silence,"" Pao said. ""I refuse to be silent on these important issues."" That means she’s still on the hook for $276,000 in legal fees, though Kleiner previously said the firm would waive the fees if Pao dropped her appeal. When reached for comment, a Kleiner spokeswoman said, ""We are glad to put this trial behind us. There is no question diversity in the workplace is an important issue.

I will also drop my appeal, since I cannot afford the risk of even more costs to fight against a firm with tremendous financial resources and massive legal and PR armies. To be clear, Kleiner and I have not reached any agreement to settle this matter. Settlement might have provided me with financial benefits, but only at the great cost of silence.

""An image decorating the wall of a woman with her hands pushed forward seemed to reach out and grab at the crowd."" I experienced light psychedelic visuals, moments of paranoia, euphoria, and at one point anger, when an idiot playing pool kept getting in the way of the concertgoers. My body felt warm, electric, and sensitive to the touch, and the objects and people I looked at seemed to expand and contract in a moment. The 2C family of drugs has a complex and sometimes controversial pastI first heard of the 2C family of drugs when a friend came to visit me while I was living in Portland, Oregon. He was a veteran in the psychedelic drug world, and he told me 2C drugs are closely related to substances like MDMA; I’d get a similar effect to MDMA but with increased psychedelic visuals and feelings. There are many versions of 2C drugs, from 2C-I to 2C-B to the infamous 2C-P, which allegedly keeps you high for as long as 24 hours. Each one has its own unique chemical properties and particular effects. The 2C family of drugs has a complex and sometimes controversial past. They are synthetic psychedelics in the phenylethylamine class. They were first synthesized by the late Alexander Shulgin around 1974, who is known for popularizing MDMA. Like MDMA, 2C drugs were first utilized for therapeutic purposes among Shulgin and his colleagues and later became known as club drugs. No official clinical trials were done, but there was some experimentation. Rumor has it that a German company distributed 2C-B in the 1980s for use as an aphrodisiac called ""Eros."" If this is true, there are no records of it. The increased interest in MDMA may revive research on 2C drugsShulgin and others have long speculated 2Cs could be used for therapeutic purposes, but a lack of basic research creates a catch-22: without any information, there’s no reason to conduct a study, says David Nichols, founding president of the Heffter Research Institute, which studies psychedelic drugs. 2Cs are known to have certain effects and dangers, but the kinds of trials a scientist would do to get a better understanding of those elements are missing. Because clinical trials are expensive, it’s hard to provide enough justification to study this family of drugs in any serious way. That means we don’t even know what dosages are dangerous. But an increased level of research interest in MDMA, the 2Cs’ older cousin, may revive interest in the drugs.   (Lukas Kästner)  When MDMA was banned in the US in 1985, 2C drugs became a quick replacement in the club scene. As was the case for many synthetic drugs, 2C drugs’ existence wasn’t well-known among government officials — which meant they weren’t illegal for some time. The main 2C varieties were eventually named as Schedule 1 drugs and became illegal around 1994. Also, like many synthetic drugs, renegade chemists began creating slightly different versions of the drugs so they could claim to sell a legal version. When MDMA was banned in the US, 2C drugs became a quick replacement Since the 1990s, a lot of other illegal drugs — MDMA, marijuana, LSD, and psilocybin — have been more widely studied by the medical research community. The 2C family has been an exception, though. At least in part because of a lack of knowledge around the family, some compounds have caused overdoses that can end in death. Some experts claim the deaths associated with the original 2C varieties should actually be attributed to tainted versions of the drugs, as investigators may have misidentified what kind of 2C it was — but problems can happen when too much of any 2C is taken. Altered versions of the original 2C types can also be significantly more potent, and one known physiological effect is a dangerously elevated heart rate. Problems can also occur when 2C drugs are taken with other substances. Overdoses related to the derivative 2C-I-NBOMe have been widely publicized; users apparently often thought they were taking LSD. Some experts told The Verge it’s easier to overdose on drugs like 2C-I than it is drugs like MDMA, since it’s more potent. But with the correct dosage, 2C-I is typically regarded as being as safe as MDMA among Erowid users — a group with an interest in psychoactive chemicals. ""Smiles"" is a term the media uses for 2C-I, though I've never heard anyone from the psychedelic community use that nameMost people know the family through lurid headlines like this one: ""Johnny Lewis, ‘Smiles,’ and the Latest Designer Drug Panic,"" a story from Grantland when a Sons of Anarchy actor died in 2012. ""Smiles"" is a term the media has used for 2C-I, though I’ve never heard anyone in the psychedelic community refer to the compound that way. Around 2000, three deaths were recorded related to the 2C-T–7 derivative. Shulgin, who was still alive at the time, expressed his frustration over what amateur chemists were doing to his promising creation. ""I’m disturbed by the fact that you get someone who wants to make a pile of money and doesn’t give a damn about the safety or the purity,"" he told The Guardian at the time. ""It’s a motivation that I’m uncomfortable with. People using psychedelics, I’m not uncomfortable with. I consider it a very personal exploration. But I’m very disturbed by the overpowering of curiosity with greed."" Shulgin’s creation, which he believed had serious therapeutic potential, became the synthetic killer of its time.   (Erich Ferdinand) MDMA-assisted psychotherapy has shown promise as a treatment for disorders like PTSD and anxiety in clinical studies. Shulgin always believed 2C drugs could provide similar benefits. ""[2C-B] is, in my opinion, one of the most graceful, erotic, sensual, introspective compounds I have ever invented,"" he said during an interview with the Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics in 2003. ""For most people, it is a short-lived and comfortable psychedelic, with neither toxic side effects nor next-day hangover. Its effects are felt very much in the body, as well as in the mind, and thus it has found clinical use as a follow-up to MDMA."" MDMA could be used to help people identify their problems during therapy — then 2C-B could be administered to help them open up the ""emotional, intuitive, and archetypal"" areas of the brain to help them solve those problems, Shulgin said. Studying clinical uses would require toxicity studies — which likely will cost $200,000The main issue with the 2C family of drugs continues to be the void of information on their effects and dangers. Much more research has been done on MDMA than any 2C compound. ""To study any possible clinical uses would require first carrying out toxicity studies, likely at a cost of around $200,000,"" Nichols says. ""To justify that cost to a private investor, one would have to have a good idea that the compound to be studied actually would prove to have beneficial medical effects."" The evidence isn’t there yet. That’s because when 2Cs were born, no one did any major investigations regarding medical uses of the class — or even toxicity. Even though MDMA and other compounds are relatively under-studied, enough information existed to suggest they might benefit some people. But because no similar studies have been conducted on 2Cs, there’s no hint the drugs may have therapeutic benefits. It's possible things could change, and once again, MDMA may lead the way Right now, the information void makes for polarized rhetoric — think of the chasm between the deaths from overdose and Shulgin’s hopes. But it’s possible to imagine that could change, and once again, MDMA may lead the way. If MDMA-assisted psychotherapy gains acceptance, doctors may consider ways to alter or heighten that therapy with other compounds, says Brad Burge, director of communications and marketing at the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. And given Shulgin’s thoughts on the class, the 2Cs seem like a natural choice for combination therapy. ""That’s the future of psychedelic therapy research,"" Burge told The Verge. ""Once MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is legal and approved, therapists and patients will want to know how to maximize these tools."" Now that MDMA is starting to break free of government restrictions, perhaps Shulgin’s dream of using 2C drugs as medicine will be realized.",0.7590229394989936,0.24097706050100642,0.4492496373737401,1449,5.0296756383712902,682,6.4017595307917885,0,4,"Science, Report"

By tracking average daily phone use and recording GPS data, scientists say they were able to identify people with depressive symptoms with a high level of accuracy. Unfortunately, the small size of the study and missing data points suggests that this method isn't exactly ready for prime time. Major depression is one of the most common mental health issues in the US. In 2012, about 16 million adults — or 6.9 percent of all US adults — experienced at least one major depressive episode. That's why finding new ways of keeping track of patients is so important. Harnessing a phone's sensors could help identify people who are at risk for depression, and ensure that patients receive treatments more promptly, says David Mohr, a behavioral scientist at Northwestern University and co-author of the study. People who suffer from depression tend to frequent fewer locations In the study, the researchers used a Craigslist ad to recruit 40 people between the ages of 19 and 58. The researchers asked the participants to fill out a common depression survey. Then, they tracked the participants' movements and phone usage for a period of two weeks through an Android app called ""Purple Robot."" People who suffer from depression tend to frequent fewer locations than people who don't, and from a social standpoint, they tend to be more withdrawn. So, the researchers analyzed the data of 28 participants to see if there was a relationship between high levels of phone usage — a proxy for being withdrawn — or GPS data, and depression. (Because of certain technical and adherence issues, 12 participants couldn't be included in the study.) Some variables gathered by the phones were strongly related to participants' depression scores, the researchers found. For instance, ""the more depressed people were, the more irregular their movements were,"" meaning that they didn't leave the house or return home at regular times, explains Sohrob Saeb, a computer scientist at Northwestern University and a co-author of the study. The researchers also found that people who were more depressed used their phones more, as expected.  The model identified people with depressive symptoms with 87 percent accuracy Overall, the model that the scientists developed was able to identify people with depressive symptoms with 87 percent accuracy. The finding ""suggests that phone sensor data can be used to provide objective behavioral markers of depression,"" says David Mohr, a behavioral scientist at Northwestern University and co-author of the study. ""It's a very small study, and they didn't get data over a long period of time, but those things aside, it definitely advances our knowledge base,"" says Ethan Berke, an epidemiologist at Dartmouth College who didn't work on the study. Justin Baker, a psychiatrist at Harvard University, agrees. ""The study's novelty is in showing that tracking this information across many individuals is possible — and does a decent job at predicting depression scores.""   Unfortunately, the researchers didn't break down the phone usage data to elucidate whether or not a participant was using the phone to browse the internet, play games, or communicate with others through instant message, for instance. Given that avoiding social interactions with others is often a symptom of depression, it's possible that figuring out if the phone was used to talk to others would have yielded a more accurate result. Mohr thinks that the phone usage that was captured in the study was ""not communication,"" however. ""Rather it was using apps, browsing, etc. — activities that people engage in to distract themselves from emotional pain, or that people to do avoid situations."" Scientists didn't look at age or whether participants used their phones for work The scientists also failed to ask the participants if they used their phones for work. ""We've learned since this publication that understanding work context is important,"" Mohr says. Having information about whether a participants works in one location or many, for instance, ""could improve the accuracy of the classifiers."" Finally, the age of the participants wasn't taken into account — even though studies have shown that people under the age of 45 spend more time using apps compared with older individuals. The fact that these data points are missing from the study ""doesn't make the study invalid, but it does mean that you need to use caution when interpreting it,"" Berke says. And ""this certainly isn't the end of the question — it's the beginning."" Mohr and his team are already in the process of enrolling 120 people into a new study.  Those participants will be ""more carefully defined in terms of depression, anxiety, and other variables,"" Mohr says. Because the scientists looked at participants' movements, it's possible that people with certain health conditions, like fatigue and mobility issues, ""might look depressed when they in fact are not,"" he says. So increasing the information gathered about the participants and their environment will be part of the research team's next steps. ""Imagine a world where the devices we carry around in our pockets can help us track our own mental health."" The study's limitations can be overcome in future experiments, Baker says.  A lot of doctors have been looking into ways of harnessing smartphone sensors to gather health data — Apple's ResearchKit is a good example — so it isn't surprising that mental health researchers have joined in. The ability to passively detect behavioral factors related to depression could open up a ton of possibilities for treatment. ""Imagine a world where the devices we carry around in our pockets can help us track our own mental health and catch ourselves before we end up needing psychiatric care,"" Baker says. This study ""takes us one step closer"" to that, ""by showing how data that our cell phones already keep track of may be able to help spot depression early on.""",0.4892959590448944,0.5107040409551056,0.8516492632072451,1021,5.1439764936336925,475,6.1242105263157898,0,2,"Science, Tech, Report"

The finding is specific to Han Chinese women, so this isn't a universally relevant piece of information. Still, this discovery could help researchers get a handle on the biology of depression — in addition to enabling the identification of new drug targets. ""We are at the beginning of a trail that can lead us to clarifying the underlying biology of depression, which can then open up treatment possibilities that have hitherto been impossible,"" says Kenneth Kendler, a psychiatrist and human geneticist at the Virginia Commonwealth University and a co-author of the study. Could lead to ""treatment possibilities that have hitherto been impossible."" Major depression is common in the US. In 2012, roughly 7 percent of US adults — that's about 16 million people — experienced at least one major depressive episode. But despite their best efforts, researchers have had a very hard time finding genetic markers that can be linked to depression. That's unfortunate; finding a genetic link could lead to more effective drugs, preventing a lot of emotional pain in the process. In the study,  researchers sequenced the genomes of over 5,000 Han Chinese women with recurrent major depressive disorder. This helped them identify the two genetic variants — versions of genes that are both located on chromosome 10 — that appear to be linked to depression. Then, they verified their findings in a second set of Han Chinese women. The finding doesn't mean that these two genetic variants are the sole cause of the disorder, however. They are actually responsible for less than 1 percent of a person's chance of developing major depression. Their effect is small but nevertheless significant — and that's a scientific first. When the researchers tried to replicate their findings in a large European population, however, the experiment was unsuccessful. One potential explanation for this result is that the part of the genome that ""hosts"" these variants differs substantially in European versus East Asian populations, Kendler says. Indeed, the two variants are found in about 50 percent and 25 percent of Han women, respectively, but they're only present in approximately 8 percent and 3 percent of the European population. Thus, comparing across ethnicities might not be possible. ""It convincingly identifies DNA variations linked to depression for the first time."" ""This is an important study because it convincingly identifies DNA variations linked to depression for the first time,"" says Jordan Smoller, a psychiatrist at Harvard University who didn't work on the study. ""It provides clues to the underlying biology of depression — and perhaps new targets for developing treatments."" Others remains skeptical, however. ""Fundamentally, I have difficulty deciding to what extent I believe the findings at all,"" says David Cutler, a human geneticist at Emory University who didn't work on the study. The link between the two genetic variants and major depressive disorder is ""at best borderline significant in the initial study,"" he says, meaning that the tests show a very weak effect. And although the replication study helps validate some of the conclusions, it only examined about 12 genes — as opposed to the whole genome — which means that it can't be used to verify the entire initial experiment. That said, if the findings are correct, they highlight an interesting dynamic.  This specific population of Han women may have helped the researchers identify two genetic variants that, although rare, may still exact a significant — albeit very small — overall effect in Europeans, Cutler says. ""I have difficulty deciding to what extent I believe the findings at all."" For Kendler, the rarity of these variants means that a lot more work will need to be done to clarify their role. Studies in men and other populations will also have to take place. But focusing on those two variants could ""ultimately clarify a mechanism that makes people vulnerable, and other people relatively invulnerable, to depression,"" he says. In short, the finding may be the string that will lead researchers back to an quilt's worth of depression biology. ""Right now, all of the commonly used antidepressants are based on biological hypotheses that are more than 50  years old,"" Smoller says. ""By opening a window onto specific genes related to the development of depression, genetic research may reveal new biological pathways that can lead to more effective and targeted treatment options.""",0.6453463465809374,0.35465365341906263,0.5101215039763879,759,5.2648221343873516,368,6.3423913043478262,0,0,"Science, Report"

Thousands of drivers are expected to participate in today's strike in the French capital and other major cities, where tensions between taxi unions and private car services are running high. Protestors burned tires and turned over cars along major thoroughfares, and there have been reported scuffles between taxi drivers and other chauffeurs. Police in riot gear intervened at one point with tear gas, Reuters reports. French taxi unions have long held grievances against Uber, and the company's UberPop service, in particular, which relies on a network of non-professional drivers. They argue that enlisting amateur chauffeurs who don't have to pay steep licensing fees gives the San Francisco-based company an unfair competitive advantage. A one-time taxi license fee in France can cost up to €240,000 ($270,000). A representative from the FTI taxi union tells Bloomberg that revenues for French taxi drivers have fallen by between 30 and 40 percent over the past two years, due to increased competition from Uber and other ride-hailing services. Following today's protest, France's interior minister ordered the Paris police to implement a ban on UberPop in the capital. ""I have given instructions, considering the grave problems with public order and the development of this illegal activity, to the police prefecture in Paris to ban UberPop activities,"" Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told reporters. Voiture cassée retournée ""#taxis en colère"" scande la foule pic.twitter.com/E2Cv6HL2RA  In France, UberPop has been operating in a murky legal space since the beginning of this year, when a new law requiring all chauffeurs to carry licenses and insurance went into effect. French officials have said the service will be illegal under the law, but courts have allowed it to continue pending a ruling on its legality from a constitutional court. The constitutional court began considering the case on Tuesday. ""We are truly sorry to have to hold clients and drivers hostage."" ""We are faced with permanent provocation (from Uber) to which there can only be one response: total firmness in the systematic seizure of offending vehicles,"" Serge Metz, the head of the taxi company G7, said on French television. ""We are truly sorry to have to hold clients and drivers hostage. We're not doing this lightly."" There have been reports today of taxi drivers seeking out and harassing Uber employees near Paris' major airports and along major highways, with the blockade forcing some to walk with their luggage to Charles de Gaulle. The strike also appears to have ensnared Courtney Love Cobain, who tweeted a photo from inside a car, saying it was attacked by protesters on her way from the airport. In subsequent tweets, the musician said protesters took her driver ""hostage,"" forcing her to pay someone to take her away by motorcycle. Dude @kanyewest we may turn back to the airport and hide out with u.picketers just attacked our car #ParisUberStrike pic.twitter.com/MtanurybOO Today's strike follows a series of altercations between taxi drivers and Uber chauffeurs across France. A 26-year-old man in Lyon said he was attacked Saturday night after telling a taxi driver he would use Uber, because the driver was on strike and refused to take him. In Strasbourg last week, taxi drivers reportedly posed as Uber customers and led drivers to isolated locations to assault them. French taxi syndicates also staged a major protest against Uber last year, which quickly turned violent. Les taxis enflamment des pneus pour lutter contre #uber #uberpop https://t.co/zIHHKdz0qj  Uber has faced regulatory hurdles and protests across the globe, largely over its insistence that it should be regulated as a technology company rather than a transportation service. French business daily Les Echos today reported that Uber France has in recent weeks begun encouraging licensed professional drivers to begin using UberPop, in an apparent move to appease regulators. In a statement to the paper, the head of Uber France denied that the change is a pre-emptive move to keep UberPop within the law, though the company has capitulated to regulators in Germany, where it agreed to pay commercial license fees amid an ongoing legal dispute. A spokesperson from Uber France called the Les Echoes report ""accurate"" while also noting that ""this doesn't mean that we're dropping POP, quite the contrary."" The spokesperson also condemned the violence against Uber partners today and called the attacking taxi drivers a small (2,800 out of 55,000 ""honest taxis"") group of ""thugs.""

An ideal exploration zone would contain multiple ""regions of interest"" — areas ripe for scientific investigation or rich with resources to sustain the humans' presence — within 100 kilometers (about 60 miles) from where the humans land. NASA will use the proposals from this workshop to develop engineering and support systems for Mars, and could use robotic missions (like the 2020 rover or the spacecraft that already orbits Mars) to scout the potential sites in greater detail. A crewed mission to Mars might not happen until at least the 2030s, if it happens at all. There are very valid concerns about how Mars' harsh conditions — extreme temperatures, radiation, dust storms — would affect the human body over time.

The bike is Ford's third such device, and like predecessors, is fitted with a motor and battery. The Flex can fold up to be stored inside a car like previous models, but where the older MoDe: Me and MoDe: Pro bikes were were smaller and designed to be used by commuters who may drive some of the distance to work, Ford says the Flex is built for bike enthusiasts. That doesn't mean you'll be getting a high-maintenance road bike with the Flex, though: the bigger device can interact with your smartphone, enabling a ""no sweat"" mode that will calculate how much effort you need to put on the pedals to get to your destination without any serious physical exertion. In addition to advancing human laziness, the MoDe:Link app also informs riders of real-time weather, road, and traffic conditions up ahead. Most interestingly, Ford says the app comes with an Apple Watch extension that can somehow detect potholes on the road. Riders will feel their handlebars vibrate when they come close to such hazards,  but the car company doesn't explain whether the software relies on existing data, is capable of scanning the road ahead, or is simply employing advanced magic to spot the holes.

The Star Wars creator announced last summer that he'd chosen the Windy City over San Francisco and Los Angeles to be the site of a new building designed to house his vast personal collection of movie props and classic artworks (including some works by famed American painter Norman Rockwell). Now we have an idea of what the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art will look like when it's completed for a planned opening in 2018. Beijing architectural firm MAD has unveiled its proposed designs for a sweeping, conical, almost volcanic structure that rises over the shore of Burnham Habor in Lake Michiagn.    The main structure of the museum will be made of a single piece of stone topped by a metal observation deck that appears to ""float"" in mid-air, providing panoramic views of the skyline and lakefront. Inside will be four levels of circular exhibition space — ""infinite loops"" as they're called by MAD, perhaps in a nod to Apple's own spaceship-like campus currently under construction. There will also be a restaurant on the top level, according to Fast Company. While the building's design is sure to turn heads and divide opinions, it's probably not even the most controversial aspect of the project: that would be the location of the site, which will require sinking or removing two large parking lots that fans of the Chicago Bears pro-football team use for tailgating (the Bears play in nearby Soldier Field stadium, which itself underwent a spaceship-like renovation and expansion a few years ago). Still, the Lucas Museum directors have said they'll open the landscaped grass area (designed by Chicago-based firm Studio Gang) up to fans who wish to drink and barbecue, Fast Company reports. And with Lucas providing full funding for construction and lots of community outreach programs planned, it's not hard to imagine the museum quickly attaining both fortune and glory.

Unveiled this week, the concept SUV — or SUC (Sports Utility Coupé) as the German carmaker calls it — boasts all sorts of futuristic features. It runs on a hybrid engine, but it's not your typical hybrid: the back wheels are powered by an electric motor while the front wheels are driven by a turbocharged hydrogen combustion engine. The electric motor's power comes from the typical sources like regenerative braking and plug-in technology, but also comes from the paint job.  Mercedes-Benz has dubbed the paint a ""multi-voltaic silver"" finish, and it not only acts as a solar cell but can also generate an electrostatic charge from the wind that the car slices through. The suspension also dynamically generates a charge, meaning there's some electricity being created with almost every movement the Vision G-Code makes. The most visually striking feature of the Vision G-Code's design is the continuous glass that stretches from the driver's side window all the way around the windshield to the passenger side. Mercedes-Benz likens it to the look of the type of windshield found on a powerboat, but science-fiction fans might think it looks more like a Cylon Raider. As with most concept cars, we'll likely never see a perfect mass production version of the G-Code, but the hope is that many of the smart ideas strewn throughout the design end up in some (if not all) of Mercedes-Benz's models in the future.

That's why a new company that's launching with a Kickstarter campaign today is hoping to find women the perfect fit using nothing but some information they already know along with a few algorithms, rather than having them try on a dozen pairs first.    ""Women's bodies change in all sorts of very predictable ways."" Called Qcut, the project comes from a former Mozilla designer who's partnered with a veteran of the fashion industry. Qcut is hoping to make jeans that'll come in around 400 different sizes, one of which it should be able to automatically determine as the proper fit for any woman who buys a pair. Qcut says it can do that using just five numbers, which you likely already know: your normal pants size, your height, your weight, your shoe size, and your bra size. ""Women's bodies change in all sorts of very predictable ways based on height,"" Qcut CEO Crystal Beasley says. For instance, ""If you have two women that are 5'10"", the one that has the bigger shoe will have a longer leg.""   It sounds strange that those five data points are enough, but Beasley points out that Qcut is just taking someone's existing pant size and running with it. ""It does seem crazy, right? Just on the face of it,"" Beasley says. ""But if you think of it, we start where other manufacturers stop."" Qcut is effectively taking your pants size and then altering the shape based on how it believes it'll end up landing on your body. The way that it comes up with those alterations isn't explicitly new either. There have been algorithms for determining proper fit based on measurements like these for over a decade, including some that appeared in patent filings that Qcut's innovation chief worked on at other fashion companies. Beasley says that Qcut just needs to take those algorithms and update them for modern body shapes. It plans to take body scans of 5,000 women and analyze them for the new data it needs. Qcut believes this model won't work with traditional storefronts If these ideas and processes sound like an obvious application of existing knowledge, that's because in many ways they are, Beasley explains. The problem is that tailoring sizes this way isn't usually economical — particularly not for the average clothing retailer that needs to deal with store space. The difference for Qcut is that with Kickstarter and later an online storefront, Beasley thinks it's possible to finally make it all work. That said, Qcut's ambitious plan will only work if it can hits an appropriate scale. It's looking for $75,000 to get off the ground, but the real goal is to build a production factory of its own — and that'll take upward of $500,000.  Qcut also has the much bigger dream of eventually offering sizing services for other small designers, allowing them to easily ensure perfect fits for their customers, though that's all dependent on how well the operation can scale in the first place. On Kickstarter, Qcut is selling jeans for around $130, but they'll likely go up to $170 once the campaign ends. That means you'll really have to value a perfect fit over searching around for one that's good enough — but that's certainly not outside the range people have shown they're willing to pay for a good pair of jeans.",0.5170309888008455,0.4829690111991545,0.49433616828952753,591,4.7021996615905248,325,5.6461538461538465,0,0,"Culture, Design"

Since 2006, Smits has nurtured that dream, and the results were on display at this year's Dutch Design Week. The Real Thing takes bottles of Coca-Cola and sends their contents through a filtration process designed in collaboration with the University of Amsterdam's Synthetic Organic Chemistry Group. The technology (boiling the Coke and re-condensing the water) is not precisely groundbreaking, but to Smits, the point is to make people ""think about how there are places in the world where people don't have access to drinking water, but they have access to Coca-Cola."" Or, alternately, ""I just want people to laugh and then hopefully think about the shit that they consume."" The Coca-Cola Company, in fact, has a terrible track record with water, even leaving aside the negative health effects of its sugary signature beverage. But the problem isn't so much that its supply chain is better than local infrastructure. It's been widely mocked for selling filtered tap water under the Dasani brand, and bottled water in general is an environmental nightmare. Critics have charged it with draining India's water supply to produce its beverages, among other parasitic business practices. And then there are the endless, less credible urban legends surrounding Coke, Dasani, and other brands. The company has tried to turn its image around by setting up centers that distribute clean water, food, and Wi-Fi in developing countries, using technology developed by inventor Dean Kamen. Smits, meanwhile, says that now that he's demonstrated the concept, there's no need to take it further.

According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (or CFPB), that was the least malicious thing about the program over the past few years. In a complaint filed today, the organization says PayPal signed people up to the service without their permission, deceptively advertised its benefits (which never materialized in some cases), forced users to use PayPal Credit instead of other payment methods, and ""mishandled"" billing in a way that raked up late fees and extra interest charges. All in all, very bad things for people trying to spend money on the internet. ""Many of these consumers learned of their PayPal Credit accounts for the first time when they received billing statements with accrued late fees and interest charges, or when they received debt-collection calls,"" the complaint says. As a result, the CFPB is requiring PayPal to pay out $15 million in reimbursements to consumers that mistakenly enrolled in the program or made purchases through it, as well as others who garnered fees from questionable customer service. That goes with a $10 million fine to the CFPB's Civil Penalty Fund, which pays out victims in instances where companies can't. The CFPB is also requiring PayPal to do a better job at disclosing when people are actually enrolling in the credit program, or being charged fees and interest. PayPal agreed to these measures, but did not admit to any wrongdoings, Bloomberg reports. In a statement, a PayPal spokesperson said ""we continually improve our products and enhance our communications to ensure a superior customer experience,"" adding that ""our focus is on ease of use, clarity and providing high-quality products that are useful to consumers and are in compliance with applicable laws."" The fines levied on PayPal are relatively small compared to some other CFPB actions.

He joked that it would be great if there was a way to refuel while he was driving, the same way Air Force jets do during long flights. The two had a laugh about it and then resumed driving. But this being Silicon Valley in an era of irrational exuberance, what seemed at first like a trivial inconvenience soon became the basis for a brand new startup, Filld. Gas without the station  ""Given all the on-demand services out there today, I just figured something like this must already exist,"" Hempy said. But research turned up nothing. ""Then I thought maybe there were some laws that would prevent it from working."" With some more digging, he found no regulatory obstacles. So he decided to leave his job at a venture capital firm and try his hand as an entrepreneur. ""What if we could get you your gas but without the gas station?""    You download the app, put in some info about your vehicle, and give it your address. Enter a window of time for delivery and a truck is dispatched to your location. You still have do the hard work of making sure the gas cap is unlocked, but I’m sure there will be a drone to solve this problem in the future. For a $7 surcharge, you can avoid the indignity of having to stand upright for several minutes and pump your gas by hand like some 20th century serf. ""Something that will capture users when they are in a pinch."" Filld currently has one fuel truck operating in the affluent neighborhoods of southern Silicon Valley: Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Redwood City. So far he says business has been booming, but remember this is a demographic of early adopters, startup billionaires, and other venture capitalists, people keen to maximize their every moment and living in perpetual fear of missing the next big thing. ""We see it as something that will capture users when they are in a pinch,"" says Hempy. ""Cutting that 15 minutes out of my life every 10 days is a lot of value."" While I felt certain at first blush that this business deserved a fair helping of snark, I found myself last night attempting to drive to an event in Manhattan with two crying babies in the backseat. When the warning light on the dash popped on to indicate I was out of gas, and I realized I had to reroute and delay by at least 15 minutes to fill up, I would gladly have paid an even higher surcharge than Filld is currently asking for a full tank of gas delivered while I was busy eating my dinner of crow and humble pie. How often would this perfect storm of factors even come together? Once or twice a year, maybe? I asked Hempy how it could possibly be efficient to pay a driver to burn gas going from house to house filling up individual cars. He says the company buys fuel wholesale and charges market rate per gallon. ""We cut out the brick-and-mortar costs of owning a station."" That leaves plenty of margin, even if Filld isn't selling slushies and slim jims. ""No corner real estate, no utility bills."" I noted that even if the margins make sense, this sounded like an environmental catastrophe. ""It seems, at first glance, like not the most environmental,"" Hempy agreed. ""But what if you cut out all the cars taking a detour for the gas station versus one truck going directly to each car?"" ""There is an exhaustion around the amount of Ubers."" There is no point in arguing with people like Hempy. For every question, the answer is simply that the startup is more efficient, all it has to do is reach truly massive scale. That’s probably why, when I made a comparison to Uber, he waved it off. ""There is an exhaustion around the amount of Ubers,"" Hempey said. ""This is more like Amazon. Who needs a physical store?

It would likely find a friendly ear at Sony and Universal Music Group, who have spoken publicly about their belief that the free tier is hurting the business. The artist-owned Tidal has made similar arguments and launched without a free tier. Warner is the only major label to recently take the position that the free tier has value. To help shake up that equation, Spotify today introduced video, podcast, and fitness to its offerings. Ads are becoming less valuable on Spotify Spotify's finances make clear where the anxiety over free music stems from. The average revenue it earns per user in the free, ad-supported tier has been falling dramatically, from around 40 cents per month in 2012 to 26 cents per month in 2014. As a percentage of overall revenue advertising now makes up just 9 percent, down from 13 percent in 2012. Yet these subscribers make up three-quarters of the 60 million people that use Spotify every month. One thing is clear: despite its impressive growth, Spotify is still struggling to turn a profit. It represent over half the dollars flowing into streaming music, according to Ek. But while its overall revenues have more than doubled since 2012, so have its losses. In its most recent financial disclosure, the company revealed that it lost $165 million, up 65 percent from one year earlier. That's because around 80 percent of its revenues flow out the door to rights holders, namely the major labels. Today's announcement was a play to escape the onerous economics of a pure play digital music service and become a more broad-based streaming media platform.  Podcasts are the most natural extension of Spotify's current model, and may be more profitable, since ad revenue can be split with partners while avoiding expensive royalties and advances. Adding video in the mix could have an even bigger impact. As Verizon's recent purchase of AOL demonstrated, video, and more specifically mobile video, is considered the most promising medium for marketing. Spotify could use video as a way to boost the amount of money it makes in the free tier. It could also use exclusives and bonus content as a way to lure customers up into the paid tier. Video can up ad rates and help convert users to paid subscribers The ladies behind Broad City came on stage to joke about how Spotify reached just the right demographic of hip, young viewers and made sense as a place for short, bite-sized clips. They hinted some would be Spotify exclusives, no doubt bookended by ads on both sides, unless you're paying $9.99 a month. Along with Comedy Central, CEO Daniel Ek said Walt Disney, Vice, ESPN, and many other big brands are apparently all joining the platform. On the fitness side Spotify is adding music that matches the pace of your run and will be integrated with Nike+.

District Court Judge George W. Wu ruled that streaming company FilmOn could ""potentially"" be entitled to a compulsory license to retransmit broadcasters' copyrighted content — a privilege that has previously been denied to other internet streaming services including Ivi and Aereo. The advisory is not final however, and in recognition of its ""significant commercial importance,"" Wu has submitted it to a higher court of appeal for further scrutiny. ""a win for technology and for the American public.""  FilmOn's legal representation Ryan Baker told Reuters that the ruling was a ""win for technology and for the American public."" He added: ""The broadcasters have been trying to keep their foot on the throat of innovation."" A spokesperson for Fox Networks, one of the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement that the ""advisory opinion contravenes all legal precedent... The court only found that FilmOn could potentially qualify for a compulsory license, and we do not believe that is a possibility... We will of course appeal and fully expect to prevail."" Last year, traditional broadcasters won a large victory against internet rivals with a nationwide injunction against prominent streaming service Aereo. In past injunctions against similar services, judges have noted that allowing the retransmission of copyrighted content over the web could ""threaten to destabilize the entire industry."" FilmOn currently remains under an injunction from 2012, but if Wu's decision is held up by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, it should be able to legally retransmit broadcasters' content. The streaming service would have to meet certain requirements (such as paying royalties and submitting semi-annual statements, according to The Hollywood Reporter), but as Wu noted in his ruling, FilmOn has indicated that it's happy to ""comply with any applicable regulations that arise out of this rulemaking.""",0.5482859256704002,0.45171407432959976,0.8299696436412258,339,5.3480825958702063,210,6.2809523809523808,0,0,"Policy & Law, Tech, US & World"

A lot of it. A recent eBay listing showed a vintage Han Solo card with a maximum print of 1,500 offered for $225 a pop. That's what you'd make working two full days at minimum wage in California.

But because the cards are all digital, the primary factor determining their value is not their appearance, but their availability.   In the app, card packs cost credits. Credits can either be bought with real money — $5 will get you 20,000 credits — or earned by completing collections and other tasks. Card pack prices vary ranging from a few pennies to $50 for some of the rarer premium collector packs.

The segment started with a bang when West was handed his Moonman by an unexpected contemporary: reigning pop queen / one-time Kanye ""victim"" Taylor Swift. After a narrated montage containing clips from every part of West's career, Swift came up on stage and talked about her West fandom and his influence on her career. She wrapped her speech by quoting West's infamous 2009 VMA interruption — you know, the one where he rushed the stage and grabbed the mic from Swift to defend Beyoncé's work — to proclaim that he's had ""one of the greatest careers of all time."" ""I will die for the art, and for what I believe in."" West then spoke at length about being changed by fatherhood, defending artistry, the hypocrisy of media, the ridiculousness of award shows, and smoking a little something before getting up on stage ""to take the edge off.""

And hey, who knows — in five years, West could be taking that signature intensity and boldness all the way to the White House. (Bring on First Lady Kim Kardashian West!) Here's the full transcript of West's speech: Bro, bro, listen to the kids. Jeremy, I got to put it down for a second, it's beautiful, Jeremy Scott designed... First of all, thank you Taylor for being so gracious and giving me this award this evening. And I often think back to the first day that I met you. Also, you know, I think about when I'm in the grocery store with my daughter and I have a really great conversation about fresh juice, you know, and at the end they say, ""You're not that bad after all."" And I think about it sometimes, like it crosses my mind when I go to a baseball game and 60,000 people boo me. It crosses my mind a little bit. And I think, if I had to do it all again, what would i have done? Would I have worn a leather shirt? Would I have drank half a bottle of Hennessy and given the rest to the audience? Y'all know you drank that bottle too. If I had a daughter at that time, would I have went on stage and grabbed the mic from someone else's... You know this arena, tomorrow, it's gonna be a completely different set up or something like that. This stage will be gone. After that night, the stage will be gone, but the effect it had on people will remain. The problem was the contradiction. The contradiction is: I do fight for artists, but in that fight I somehow was disrespectful to artists. I didn't know how to say the right thing, the perfect thing. I just... I sat at the Grammys and saw Justin Timberlake and Cee-Lo lose. Gnarls Barkley and the Future Sex album... Justin, I ain't trying to put you on blast but I saw that man in tears, bro. And I was thinking like, he deserves to win album of the year. And this small box that we are in as the entertainers of the evening. How could you explain that? Sometimes I feel like, you know, all this bullshit that they run about beef and all that, sometimes I feel like I died for the artist's opinion. For the artists to be able to have an opinion after they were successful. I'm not no politician, bro. And look at that. You know how many times MTV ran that footage again? 'cause it got them more ratings. You know how many times they announced that Taylor was gonna give me the award? 'cause it got them more ratings. Listen to the kids, bro.

Mac vs. PC commercials and jabs from Steve Jobs were once regular occurrences, but if you want evidence that the two have moved on then look no further than yesterday’s Apple keynote. Apple had barely finished introducing its new iPad Pro tablet when Microsoft jumped on stage. Yes, Microsoft on stage at an Apple event. You’d have to return to the days of Bill Gates rescuing Apple or announcing Internet Explorer and Office for Mac to remember the last time Microsoft was a big highlight of an Apple event. It was a surreal moment. Apple wants to pitch the iPad Pro at businesses, and it needed Microsoft’s help. Apple’s head of marketing, Phil Schiller, even admitted that ""yeah, these guys know productivity."" It was honest, but it was also key that Apple was welcoming Microsoft on stage as the king of productivity. Apple didn’t show off its own iWork applications, it chose Microsoft’s superior Office software.  Back in the days of Steve Ballmer it’s hard to imagine this ever happening. Ballmer would have probably laughed at the iPad Pro, blind to the benefits it could bring to Microsoft as a software and services company, instead of just a Windows, Windows, Windows company. Microsoft’s new CEO Satya Nadella has formed new partnerships with Dropbox, acquired important software like Acompli, and extinguished a bitter war with Salesforce. He isn’t blind to the benefits of collaboration, and this new approach will only benefit Microsoft’s Office dominance. Microsoft believes in the iPad Pro ""At Microsoft we really believe that bringing together the iPad Pro with Microsoft Office — the ink, the multitasking capabilities — will really transform the way people work on these type of devices,"" said Microsoft’s Office chief, Kirk Koenigsbauer, as he finished off his Office for iPad Pro demo. It was a moment of acceptance for Microsoft that the iPad is here to stay, but also a truce with Apple. While much has been discussed of the ""new Microsoft"" and Nadella’s approach to software and services, Apple’s acceptance that Microsoft is key to productivity is a clear vote of confidence in this new Microsoft.   The mere fact that Apple now believes in hybrid devices that transform to use touch, keyboards, and a stylus backs up Microsoft’s own message. This combination of inputs has been at the core of Surface for three years, and now Apple is accepting it as a crucial part of its own ""post-PC"" future. Some might see the iPad Pro as a giant threat to Microsoft’s Surface tablet, but it’s clear Microsoft isn’t concerned. The new Microsoft knows its place in the world. It doesn’t care if you’re using a Surface or an iPad Pro, it’s happy just as long as you’re using Office and Microsoft’s other software and services. That’s the sign of a true software company and Apple just agreed.",0.6553446475916302,0.34465535240836975,0.19676139213543067,517,4.9961315280464218,273,5.8827838827838832,0,2,"Apple, Microsoft, Tech, Report"

Announced yesterday, Live Photos extends the moment of capture by a second-and-a-half on either side of the 12 megapixel stills snapped by the new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. A Live Photo isn’t a GIF (it includes sound) and it’s not a video (motion is created using a ""space efficient frame-to-frame technology""). It's something ""new"" from Apple and the results are pretty dramatic.   What’s more, Facebook will be supporting Live Photos in the iOS Facebook app this year. And Facebook owns Instagram. In 2014 the two combined for about 400 million of the roughly 1.8 billion photos uploaded and shared each day. Sure, HTC had Zoe long before yesterday’s Apple event. But the difference between Zoe and Live Photos is the execution and scale. In typical Apple fashion, it's not first to use the tech but it stands a good chance of being first to make it popular. But what does that mean for photography when every moment captured will soon be a 3-second clip? As my colleague Sam Byford mused today in The Verge Slack room, ""what’s the point of Cartier-Bresson capturing ‘the decisive moment’ if you can just scroll through a few seconds on either side and change the composition? The power of a photo is in what isn’t shown."" So, if photography is about removing things. And if a single frame is the ultimate expression of a moment. Is a Live Photo even a photograph? The Pokémon Company has announced a new mobile game called Pokémon Go, produced in collaboration with Nintendo and Niantic, the former Google subsidiary behind the Ingress augmented reality game. Pokémon Go looks to follow in the footsteps of Ingress, letting players find virtual Pokémon and do battle in the real world, powered by GPS. Niantic broke away from Google after the Alphabet reorganization; Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are making a joint investment in the now independent company. Google has decided to relaunch its Google Wallet app today ahead of the upcoming Android Pay rollout. The old Google Wallet was designed to be an easy way to load a digital account with cash for transferring money among friends or making online purchases. It was also a way to pay in-store using NFC terminals, similar to Apple Pay, and store gift cards and promotional offers, like Apple's Passbook. The new version, however, is tailored more as a competitor to services like Square Cash and Venmo, in which you tie in a bank account or debit card and can send money using your smartphone. Sometimes people make predictions and they're terribly wrong, but every once in a while an oracle appears with a prophecy that predicts the future. Joel Watson, a cartoonist, is today's oracle. Watson captured the moment Microsoft announced its original Surface tablet, back in 2012, in cartoon form. The crowd's reaction simply mocks Microsoft's tablet, but Watson predicts the crowd at Apple's event (in 2015!) will love it and claim Apple invented such a device. It's Apple's reality distortion field in full effect. Genius. A San Diego-based startup called Pathway Genomics released a blood test today that it says can detect mutations associated with multiple cancers. If true, the $699 test would be a big deal for medicine because it could be used to catch cancer before a person shows symptoms. But Pathway Genomics doesn’t have data that shows that the test actually works. Apple announced the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus today. And if you want one, Apple would like you to think that it's business as usual. You can preorder them starting September 12th, and they'll be available on September 25th.

But there was indeed a shared, unifying strategy at play, and that was the pursuit and maintenance of high profit margins. Viewed through the unemotional prism of ""how much money do I make from every unit sold?,"" there’s a perfect congruence between the diversity of new Watch bands, the content-focused reboot of the Apple TV, and the launch of the large and expensive iPad Pro. Apple isn’t here to sell the most of anything; its overarching goal is simply to generate the greatest possible profit. It's a beguilingly simple approach to a very difficult and complex market.   When tech companies are confronted with stagnating sales, as Apple has been with the iPad in recent times, they usually look to stimulate demand by cutting prices or adding features and enhancements at the existing price. In other words, they erode their profit margin — the amount made per unit sold — in the hope of producing a larger absolute profit through a greater volume of sales. That’s how most price wars get started, whether you’re talking about big-screen TVs, Android smartphones, or even RAM sticks for your motherboard. Each of these price competitions has been a boon for the consumer, making more and better options available at ever-reducing prices, but they’ve been devastating to most of their participants. That might be why Apple resolutely refuses to engage in them. Stagnating iPad sales have forced a reaction from Apple, which is going upmarket Apple’s answer to iPad stagnation has been to go further upmarket. Instead of slashing iPad prices to counter competition from Samsung and the rest of the Android hordes, Apple is stepping into a higher price bracket and equipping the iPad Pro to become its first 2-in-1 device. It will clash with competent opposition from Microsoft’s Surface Pro and even from Apple’s own MacBook range, but that’s the competition that Tim Cook and company want to be in. Cook has already said he’s unafraid of cannibalizing the Mac business, and he sees the iPad as a bigger threat to Windows PCs anyway. It’s no accident that Phil Schiller compared the new A9X processor of the iPad Pro to portable PCs, claiming that it’s faster than 80 percent of those that shipped over the last year.   The Apple Watch partnership with Hermès is an obvious evolution for Apple as well. Nothing maintains profit margins better than the intangible, unquantifiable quality of prestige. That’s how Beats by Dre headphones continue to do so well, despite not having a clear-cut performance advantage. Yes, we’re still talking about technology products, but the way we shop for them has evolved far beyond the pursuit of mere functionality, and Apple is capitalizing on the attractions of the shopping experience that are cheap for the manufacturer to generate yet still valuable to the consumer. Like fancy watch straps and custom Hermès watch faces. That’s also a big reason for why Apple Stores open iPhone launch days with rapturous applause for the first people in line, and why Apple tends to be generous with its device replacement schemes. Like luxury stores and hotels, Apple includes a few extra customer service perks knowing very well that they’ll pay off in encouraging people to spend lavishly on its goods, expecting more of the same high quality service. It’s a calculated, thoughtful system for maintaining the highest possible price-to-cost ratio across all of Apple’s products. The only colorful iPhones you can get today are also the most expensive ones The 16GB entry-level iPhone 6S has stirred plenty of discontent recently, but it too makes perfect sense when viewed through an accountant’s eyes. Apple’s selling iPhones at an unprecedented rate and, for today at least, doesn’t need to incentivize people to want a new iPhone. So of course it will keep its cheapest handset at least a little bit hamstrung, in order to stimulate sales of its higher-priced variants. If Apple makes more money per 64GB iPhone than per 16GB iPhone, why would it genuflect to our desires for an ideal iPhone that splits the difference? Further evidence of Apple’s constant nudging of shoppers toward more expensive options comes from the choice of colors now available: as of today, only the new iPhone 6S family can be bought in gold (or the new rose gold variation), leaving the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus with only monochromatic paint jobs. With the plastic iPhone 5C quietly discontinued, the only colorful iPhones you can get today are the shiny, happy, and most expensive new ones.   Most of Apple’s profits today come from iPhone sales, which the company has always stressed are the result of designing the whole user experience, not just the hardware. Apple has spent this year developing its software and services to lock yet more users inside the iOS ecosystem and entice them to keep buying iDevices. Apple Music builds on Apple’s iCloud and iTunes Match subscription services to become the company’s biggest new venture into the entertainment business since the introduction of the iTunes music store over a decade earlier. This week, the Apple TV is getting a major overhaul that places games and apps front and center, and content deals for original and exclusive programming for it have been rumored throughout the summer. Apple is tightening its grip and control over the entire iOS user experience The Apple News app on iOS 9 also gives Apple an enhanced position in the mobile publishing (and advertising) space, and it synergizes beautifully — from Apple’s perspective — with the new ad-blocking feature coming to Safari. Publishers struggling to monetize their content in Apple’s mobile browser will be induced to participate in Apple News, where they’ll have to use iAd, Apple’s advertising platform. It all amounts to more control for Apple over how things look and function, and, importantly, how money flows from consumer to content provider.   Even though software has the potential for vastly higher profit margins than hardware, Apple doesn’t strictly need any of its services to generate significant revenue of their own. Apple Pay is entirely free to users, provided they have purchased a compatible Apple Watch, iPhone, or iPad. So long as Apple’s services buttress the world’s most profitable product range, Apple will be happy. A time will eventually come when the iPhone’s incredible popularity will subside. Like the iPod before it, the iPhone has reached iconic status, but it too shall be superseded, or at least commodified like every other smartphone. Adding unique features like 3D Touch is one way to retard progress toward such a fate, but Apple is also working on diversifying its range with this year’s Watch and iPad Pro introductions.

Motorola's next Droid smartphone for Verizon sounds like a true flagship in terms of hardware specifications, but boy is it ugly. Upleaks has posted a render of what's claimed to be the Droid Turbo 2, a phone that resembles the Moto X Play with some noticeable design tweaks — and carrier branding turned up to 11. Elsewhere in the world, this phone will reportedly be known as the Moto X Force. Motorola has split up its front-facing speaker, a design choice that Verizon has used to sandwich its signature checkmark (which isn't even the company's logo anymore) right in the middle. Bizarrely, it's only the check with no ""Verizon"" text beneath it. Around back is the familiar Droid emblem on top of Motorola's patterned silicon material that also appears on the Play. That part's expected and excusable. Upleaks has previously posted details of what else we can expect from the new Droid, which is said to — somehow — include a ""shatterproof"" 5.43-inch display, Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of RAM, and support for microSD cards.

On July 14 at 7:49AM ET, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft whizzed by dwarf planet Pluto, making it the first manmade object to reach this mysterious space rock in our Solar System. It has taken nine years for New Horizons to reach Pluto, and it’s gathering a ton of valuable information, including atmospheric measurements, spectral data, and high-res imaging. Stay tuned as we receive more photos and information over the coming weeks. NASA has released some truly stunning images of Pluto since it began the year-long download of the rest of New Horizons' data. Now the agency has taken some of those images and made a new virtual flyover of the dwarf planet, and the results are pretty spectacular. The video was made with images that were released last Friday, all of which were taken by New Horizons' LORRI (Long Range Reconnaissance Imager) camera. It starts low, just above the mountains that the New Horizons team calls the... Just a few short months ago we had almost no idea what Pluto really looked like. These days we’re looking at it unprecedented detail, thanks to the New Horizons spacecraft's successful flyby in July. The team that operates New Horizons recently started the year-long download of the remainder of the spacecraft's data, and the early returns are phenomenal. Case in point — yesterday afternoon, the New Horizons team uploaded almost 40 new high-resolution images of the dwarf planet to the Johns... One month ago today, the New Horizons spacecraft completed a 3-billion-mile journey across the Solar System and performed a flyby of Pluto. The images that it sent back were breathtaking and beautiful. Sadly, there was no video of the epic event — until now! Vimeo user Bjorn Jonsson made a simulated video that lets you relive the flyby from the theoretical passenger's seat of New Horizons. Jonsson made the short video using real images taken by New Horizons of Pluto and its moon, Charon. You... The New Horizons space probe that's currently beaming back images of Pluto and its moons has made its way to the outer reaches of our solar system on a budget of just $700 million. Spread over the course of 15 years, the cost of this NASA mission is less than it takes to run most professional sports teams these days, but it's delivered so much more joy, pride, and awesome science. The United States has earned the unqualified admiration of the international community by pushing back the... NASA's New Horizons spacecraft has snapped an image of another icy mountain range on Pluto — this one located on the southwestern edge of the dwarf planet's famous heart region. These peaks are between a half mile and one mile high and are located 68 miles northwest of Norgay Montes, the other Pluto mountain range previously photographed by New Horizons.  NASA released even closer shots of Pluto's smaller moons Nix and Hydra today, showcasing the weird shapes of these tiny space rocks. An enhanced-color image of Nix makes the moon look something like a pinkish jelly bean, while the image of Hydra shows a lopsided moon with various curves and dips. These moons stand in stark contrast to the mostly spherical moons that dominate our Solar System.  Pluto's atmosphere has an extended reach. Data collected by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft reveals that the gas surrounding the dwarf planet extends as far as 1,000 miles outward into space. That's more than 13 times farther than Earth's atmosphere, which tapers off at around 75 miles above our planet's surface. Previous observations from Earth have only been able to record Pluto's atmosphere reaching 170 miles out into space. Pluto's atmosphere has an extended reach About an hour after its... NASA has released some truly stunning images following New Horizons' successful flyby of Pluto. But those almost pale in comparison to this new simulated video that takes viewers above the 11,000-foot-tall mountains of ice that mark up the dwarf planet's surface. The simulated video shows what NASA is informally calling the ""Norgay Montes"" (or Norgay Mountains) as well as the frozen plains of the Sputnik Planum. All of the images used to create the visualization were taken during New... NASA has published the first high-resolution mosaic image of the surface of Pluto. In the image we see what New Horizons' principal investigator Alan Stern calls the ""icy, frozen plains"" of Pluto.  It is made from three images that were taken by the LORRI imager on the New Horizons spacecraft at 6:10AM ET on July 14th, shortly before the spacecraft's closest approach. For scale, each pixel represents 0.4km on the surface.  One of the three frames in the mosaic shows a complex, frozen section... NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft made its closest approach to Pluto on Tuesday July 14th, gathering some pretty interesting data about the dwarf planet. From large white hearts and dark equatorial regions on Pluto's surface to methane ice caps and even the presence of snow, New Horizons has given scientists a lot of information about the space rock. And some of Pluto's features have researchers stumped. We're going to get even more pictures of Pluto and its moons over the coming days. Stay... We're getting even crisper images of Pluto's largest moon Charon. NASA just released the first high-resolution photograph of a section of Charon's surface, zeroing in on a feature that looks like a ""mountain in a moat."" This image was taken from the New Horizons spacecraft on July 14th at 6:30AM ET, when it was 49,000 miles away from the moon. It depicts an area that's 200 miles long, filled with craters and a mysterious depressed mountain at the top lefthand corner. ""This is a feature that... History was made this week; the kind that changes curricula. New Horizons gave us our first real look at Pluto and its moons. As Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator, described it to me, ""We turned a point of light into a planet, and we did it like that"" — a declarative statement he accented with an inhumanly loud finger snap. That's catchy, but boiling down the New Horizons mission to 15 words sort of obscures the magnitude of the accomplishment. New Horizons was the fastest... One of Pluto's elusive moons is finally coming into view. NASA released the very first up-close image of Pluto's known outermost moon Hydra, giving us our first taste of the space rock's shape. And it's an awkward one. Up until now, images of Hydra have been very small and blurry. This latest image was taken on Monday July 13th at 7:16PM ET from about 400,000 miles away. Its resolution is about 2 miles per pixel, and the image is the first really clear photograph we've received yet of Hydra.... NASA just released the first frame of the high-resolution scans of Pluto. The new image is zoomed into less than one percent of Pluto's surface. It was published less than 24 hours after NASA received confirmation that the New Horizons spacecraft successfully completed its flyby of Pluto. More of these scans will be released on Friday. The high-resolution image of Pluto's surface shows us a fraction of the lower left portion of yesterday's image. John Spencer, a New Horizons science team... NASA just released the clearest image yet of Pluto's largest moon Charon taken by the New Horizons spacecraft. It's the best single-frame image of Charon the probe will get during this encounter period, with a resolution of 1.5 miles per pixel, and it says a lot about this space rock.

The image was taken with the LORRI instrument, the high-resolution imager on... New Horizons is alive and on its way to the inner Kuiper belt, according to NASA. The spacecraft sent back a signal at 8:53PM ET, confirming a successful completion of its flyby of Pluto. The news was announced in front of a packed house at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, the location of New Horizons mission control. ""We're in lock with telemetry with the spacecraft,"" Alice Bowman, the mission's operations manager, said from the control room. The signal was a tiny packet of... We're still hours away from receiving confirmation that New Horizons lived through its flyby of Pluto, but that doesn't mean the team behind the spacecraft is twiddling their thumbs.

Legend has it that on the evening of September 14th, 1928, a 26-year-old Walt Disney looked up in the sky and observed a glow unlike he had ever seen before. It was faint, but Disney was a known visionary — one with superhuman sight. Disney squinted, and through that squint he saw a planet. Squinting further, he saw on the surface of that planet a silhouette of a dog — one with its ears down, probably. A friendly dog. Disney quickly sketched what he saw but kept it secret for several years,... Excitement over the New Horizons probe's flyby past Pluto has been pretty remarkable, and NASA, it seems, has known exactly how to take advantage: hit up social media. The US space agency published the most detailed image of Pluto ever this morning at around 7AM ET, sharing the photo via Instagram hours before it was posted to the official nasa.gov website. It's a canny decision by NASA, which enjoys some 3.5 million followers on the photo sharing network and routinely clocks up more than... Just minutes before the long-awaited flyby took place at 7:49AM ET, NASA ""teased"" the final full-frame color image of Pluto set to be released before the event by publishing it on Instagram. It was taken at about 4PM ET on July 13th, according to NASA, from 476,000 miles away. The high-resolution image was released after the flyby, and can be seen above. In the image, we can see the ""heart"" of Pluto in much greater detail than before, craters that were impossible to make out in previous... Tuesday, July 14th might be Bastille Day in France, but the whole world will be watching and waiting to find out if the New Horizons spacecraft successfully makes its long-awaited flyby of Pluto. In honor of that interplanetary feat, Google has switched over to an adorable doodle that shows a cartoonish New Horizons zipping past the dwarf planet. It's a simple doodle by most standards, though two details stick out. First, the doodle simply shows the job that New Horizons set out to... ""Fasten your seat belts — New Horizons has arrived at the Pluto System."" Those were the words of Alan Stern, New Horizons' principal investigator, at this morning's briefing. After more than nine years and 3 billion miles, the spacecraft is inside the dwarf planet's Hill sphere of influence and ready to take the first detailed measurements and photographs of Pluto.   New Horizons is already well within 1... NASA's New Horizons probe officially entered Pluto's sphere of gravitational influence last week, and this Tuesday, more than nine years after leaving Earth, the spacecraft will perform a flyby of the icy dwarf planet at a distance of 7,800 miles. Onboard instruments will capture the most detailed images of Pluto ever seen, but nestled next to these tools are some more unusual items of cargo — including a portion of the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh, the American astronomer who discovered Pluto. The New Horizons spacecraft has officially entered Pluto's neighborhood. NASA mission specialist Alex Parker tweeted today that the probe has entered the area of space where Pluto exerts more gravitational influence than the Sun does. That means New Horizons has entered into Pluto's sphere of influence — also known as its Hill sphere.  New Horizons has entered Pluto's Hill sphere.   We are now in Pluto space.

In anticipation of that historic moment, the National Space Society commissioned this beautiful video teaser (conveniently called New Horizons) by the man behind Wanderers, the space-themed short film that went... The New Horizons spacecraft is still more than two months away from reaching Pluto, but it's now close enough to make out some details of the dwarf planet and one of its moons. NASA just held a mission briefing to update the public about the progress of the mission, during which the agency released a number of GIFs made from the newest images taken of Pluto.

The US also saw a significant reduction in the proportion of Hispanics who didn't obtain medical care due to the high cost of that care. Taken together, the findings indicate that the US made important strides last year in terms of reducing the racial disparities that have plagued the country's health care system for so long — even if tremendous gaps remain. Black Americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group for cancer, and they're 40 percent more likely to suffer from high blood pressure than white Americans. In addition, Hispanic and non-Hispanic black adults are more likely to suffer from diabetes compared with white and Asian adults. That's why this new CDC data is so important; it shows that the US is starting to reduce the health care imbalances that exist between people of color and white people in the US. 17 percent of black people didn't have health insurance Overall, the biggest change in the rate of uninsured took place among Hispanic and black Americans. In 2014,  the proportion of black and Hispanic adults without health insurance was reduced to 17 and 34 percent, respectively, down from 25 percent for black Americans and 41 percent for Hispanics in 2013. And the percentage of Hispanic-Americans aged 18 to 64 who saw a health care professional in the last 12 months rose to 70 percent from 68 percent — the only change in that category that was deemed statistically significant.   That said, a lot of things didn't change. Health care access remained largely the same for black and Asian adults in 2014. And despite the new health care law, the percentage of people who saw a health care professional in 2014 didn't budge significantly for white, black, or Asian adults.  Over 8 million people signed up for health insurance in 2014 The fact that the number of uninsured Americans was greatly reduced in the wake of the Affordable Care Act isn't entirely new information. At the end of 2014, private sector surveys and a government report showed that the number of Americans without health insurance had been reduced by 25 percent in a single year. That means that over 8 million people signed up for health insurance in 2014. But breaking down the data by race helps put that change into perspective.   Despite efforts by the US government, 34 percent of Hispanics and 17 percent of black people still didn't have health care coverage in 2014, compared with 12 percent of white Americans and 12 percent of Asian Americans. And in 2014, Hispanics were still far more likely to have trouble gaining access to health care services compared with white people.

And that photo is just the beginning. Today is historic for humankind, as the New Horizons spacecraft transmits many more photos of Pluto from today's flyby of the dwarf planet. In January 2004, our nation fed on every bit of news around the Mars rover landing, but public interest in space has diminished in the past decade. How does Pluto compare to the most popular film on Earth, Minions? In this totally not scientific Google Trends chart, I've included Minions and Pluto, along with New Horizons and NASA — the latter of which has been on a steady decline of interest since the Mars Rover landing at the beginning of the chart. I've also included Shrek, because Shrek 2 was the highest grossing movie of 2004, and the franchise is the closest we have to a Minions of that era. Space X was originally included as a search variable, but its rank was so diminutive that it barely registered on the chart. What does this teach us about space? Well, it doesn't say much about space so much as it tells us about the world we live in, where public attention is shaped by massive ad budgets. Even the most awe-inspiring moments struggle to compete for attention against half a billion dollars in promotional partnerships. One day, I will recall where I was when we put a Minion on the Moon.    Subscribe to What's Tech? on iTunes, listen on SoundCloud, or subscribe via RSS. And be sure to follow us on Twitter.

It’s early, but the auditorium is overflowing. We’re about to have breakfast with some pretty big planetary celebrities, including Neil deGrasse Tyson; Denton Ebel, chair of the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences; and director of astrovisualization Carter Emmart. But the real guest of honor is Pluto. After a nine-year trek through our Solar System, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft will make its closest approach to the dwarf planet while we’re having our breakfast — coming within just 7,800 miles. That may seem like a long way off, but the probe has covered a total distance of over 3 billion miles to get to Pluto. Think of it like this: sending such a tiny probe to a small point of space so far away is like hitting a hole-in-one from New York to Los Angeles. It’s also the first time humans will explore and study Pluto — and we are all going to bask in the moment together. Sending such a tiny probe to a small point of space so far away is like hitting a hole-in-one from New York to Los Angeles Of course, none of us are actually going to see the flyby; there’s no interplanetary production team camped out at the far reaches of our Solar System to capture the view. But we do have a real-time 3D visualization of New Horizons passing through the Pluto system. The huge IMAX screen in front of us shows exactly where New Horizons is located relative to Pluto (and its main moon Charon), as well as the relative location of the Sun and neighboring stars. We may not be able to witness the event firsthand, but we can guess what it looks like. Tyson, Emmart, and Ebel sit at a table in front of the screen; they walk us through the science of the mission and what to expect in the hours to come. They discuss the nitrogen rapidly escaping from Pluto’s atmosphere, and Ebel talks about how the world might be home to cryovolcanoes. ""Come on, ice volcanoes,"" Tyson says to Ebel, as the crowd laughs. ""Learn to communicate.""   Also with us — albeit digitally — are planetary scientists and engineers from Australia, Sweden, Germany, and Ghana, appearing on two large monitors via a Google Hangout link. Tyson and company pose fans’ questions to the engineers at NASA’s Applied Physics Laboratory in Baltimore, Maryland, such as how fast New Horizons is traveling or what’s going to happen to it when it passes by Pluto. That’s not the end of the road, though — after the spacecraft passes Pluto, it will send us data for the next 16 months. ""It’s happening; it’s actually happening."" The researchers show us the 3D visualization with the attitude of children who are about to open a big Christmas present. They point out the visualization’s ability to show us in real time the exact portions of Pluto that are being photographed by New Horizons. ""This is incredibly exciting,"" Orkan Umurhan, a post-doctoral researcher at NASA, says. ""It’s happening; it’s actually happening."" The crowd bursts into applause. The irony of Tyson hosting an event about Pluto is not lost on the crowd: the Hayden Planetarium director is famous for his involvement in helping to reclassify the rock as a dwarf planet. Both Emhart and Ebel make quips about this to Tyson, even mentioning how some believe the flyby will help promote the dwarf planet back to full planet status. Tyson sarcastically makes clear his doubts that this will happen. But he’s excited, too. ""This is a special moment,"" Tyson says. ""This is a special day."" Soon, it’s time for the moment we’ve been waiting for, and at 7:49AM ET, Emmart triumphantly declares, ""That’s it! We’re at closest approach."" At the edge of our Solar System, there’s a tiny space probe zooming by a dwarf planet we’ve barely seen. The crowd goes nuts.   The researchers’ delight quickly transforms into cautious optimism. After all, the special moment we just celebrated may not have occurred at all. Currently, New Horizons is in a communication blackout; all of its instruments are focused on gathering as much data as possible about Pluto. We won’t know until 8:53PM ET tonight — when New Horizons sends back the ""all clear"" signal to NASA — if it actually flew by Pluto. NASA estimates there’s a one in 10,000 chance of mission failure due to nearby debris or dust hitting the spacecraft. In the auditorium, that possibility seems remote. Everyone’s grinning foolishly — including me. My heart flutters to be surrounded by so many people who are genuinely excited about NASA and science. It’s an incredible feeling to be among fellow space dorks.

It sounds incredibly futuristic, but they're all elements of different projects that Jaguar Land Rover is working on right now in order to make its cars much smarter and safer. It detailed the projects today in a news post, following up last week's announced that it was developing sensors that could monitor for potholes. ""We believe some of the technologies currently being used in aerospace and medicine could help improve road safety and enhance the driving experience,"" says Wolfgang Epple, Jaguar's research and technology director. ""These research projects are investigating how we could exploit this for the benefit of our customers and other road users.""  Brain activity, heart rate, and breathing monitors could tell if a driver is alert The brain monitoring tech is easily the most incredible sounding project of the bunch. Jaguar wants its cars to be able to tell if a person is paying attention to the road or off daydreaming, so that it can try to make the driver alert again should they lose focus. It says that's possible by monitoring for brainwaves that indicate a person is tired or distracted. The problem — aside from reliability issues — is that current brainwave monitors typically involve a headset. But Jaguar says that it should be able to monitor for brainwaves through sensors embedded in the steering wheel. It's apparently looking into adapting tech that's already used by NASA to monitor pilots' concentration. If the tech works, Jaguar says that it may try to get drivers focused again by vibrating the steering wheel or pedals. If that doesn't work, it might move on to warning icons and sounds. The development could certainly be a help today, but Jaguar imagines it being particularly important in the future when it's selling self-driving cars. The car may have to hand off control to a driver at some point, and it's critical to know if the driver is ready. That concern also stretches into Jaguar's interest in monitoring its drivers' health through their heart rate and breathing. It says that it's testing a ""medical-grade sensor"" that can be embedded in a seat and monitor heart rate and breathing through vibrations. Jaguar hopes that the sensors will be able to detect ""the onset of sudden and serious illness,"" and give the car enough information to know when a person isn't in the right shape to drive (it wouldn't be a bad idea to autonomously reroute someone to a hospital at that point, too). One additional amazing part about this: Jaguar even imagines that the car could tell if a driver is a little stressed out and then put on some mood lighting or smooth music to help them chill out. Other projects are aimed at increasing driver awareness in the short term While those two research projects are partly focused on making autonomous driving safe, Jaguar is detailing two other projects that are meant more for current vehicles. One is a ""haptic accelerator pedal"" that could pulse or vibrate in order to alert a driver to whether they were going over the speed limit or were close to hitting another car. The other project is an infotainment system that could detect what button a driver means to push before they actually touch it. It would apparently use cameras to follow a driver's hand and predict mid-air what they mean to press. It might even use ultrasonic waves to create a tapping or tingling sensation in a person's finger so that they know the system registered their movement. The idea is that this could reduce the time a driver is looking away from the wheel, however briefly (in tests, Jaguar says it's increased button selection speed by 22 percent), but it also sounds like it could be far more frustrating and time consuming if it doesn't work. It's not clear how far along any of these projects are, and some of them are evidently meant for cars that are likely many years out. Still, the details that Jaguar has been giving on how it's trying to bring advanced tech into the car have been fascinating, and they suggest a much more advanced vehicle than most of us have been imagining driving down the road one day.",0.15659077044043204,0.843409229559568,0.15164034910971144,718,4.8231197771587739,359,5.9554317548746516,0,0,Transportation

Everyone’s gaze turned outward as we meandered through the woods, passing playgrounds and lunch break joggers, looking for a hulking white oasis that was impossible to miss.  I was on my way to see Frank Gehry’s latest work, the sprawling new Fondation Louis Vuitton. The $130 million building, affectionately dubbed “the glass cloud,” was commissioned in 2006 as a contemporary art and performance space for the Fondation, which is the philanthropic wing of the LVMH luxury goods conglomerate. It opened to the public Monday, after a week of media buzz and star-studded galas. French President François Hollande was on hand for the building’s inauguration last week, where he described the building as a “cathedral of light” and a “miracle of intelligence, creativity, and technology.”  The museum certainly cuts an imposing figure, with its galactic glass ""sails"" standing in cold contrast to the pastoral children’s park that neighbors it. From afar, it looks equal parts spaceship and sailboat — maybe even a bird. Twelve diaphanous sails encase the 126,000-square-foot building, shielding an oblique, undulating white exterior that the Fondation likens to an iceberg. The design was inspired, Gehry said, by the glass architecture of the late 19th century, as well as the children’s park it empties onto. Water cascades into a lower-level ""grotto,"" illuminated by the soft yellow hues of a light installation by Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson. Louis Vuitton branding is sparse, but hardly subtle: an enormous shining ""LV"" brooch looms over the entrance. Inside are 11 gallery spaces, a 350-person auditorium, and an upscale restaurant. The lobby’s soaring ceilings distill ambient chatter into a soft buzz, with giant windows framing the lush lawn outside. Navigating through the galleries can be a winding and sometimes disorienting experience, but you invariably end up at one of the site’s tree-dotted rooftop terraces with gorgeous panoramic views of the city — Eiffel Tower and all. This week’s opening caps a busy month for Gehry, who, at 85, is still among today’s most celebrated and recognizable ""starchitects."" His career is the focus of a major retrospective that opened this month at the Centre Pompidou museum in Paris, and the Fondation has reinvigorated debates about his work. ""98 percent of everything that is built and designed today is pure shit."" There are of course some who criticize his buildings as excessive and over the top — the Fondation faced stiff opposition from local groups before being greenlit by the French government — but Gehry has brushed them aside, sometimes with vigor. At a press conference in Spain last week, Gehry flashed his middle finger to a journalist who asked him to comment on those who say his works are just ""spectacle."" ""Let me tell you one thing,"" the architect replied. ""In this world we are living in, 98 percent of everything that is built and designed today is pure shit. There’s no sense of design, no respect for humanity or for anything else. They are damn buildings and that’s it."" ""Once in a while, however, a group of people do something special. Very few, but God, leave us alone.""  A model of the building is on display in one of its 11 gallery spaces.

The idea for the yacht was first sketched out by a Russian advertising executive on a napkin and then fleshed-out by industrial designer Igor Lobanov, according to BMT. The two rising stars wanted to create something that would stand out from the sea of comparatively bland and boring superyachts around now. ""Outside the marine industry, all yachts look the same: it seems that modern architecture, product design and car design have no influence on yachts,"" said Lobanov in a statement.  Not only is the STAR gigantic, with 37,700-square-feet of interior space, eight decks, four elevators, a helipad and a daytime capacity of 200 guests, but it would shoot across the water at a relatively zippy 18 knots. It's being marketed as a private yacht or hotel, and will cost an estimated $500 million, as Lobanov told Business Insider. The creators of the STAR get points from me for their sheer audacity, but I can't help but fault their STAR for not being actually star-shaped. Instead it's more of a curved triangle, with a long, gently bowed hull. It's true that in particularly clear waters, the reflection of the top part of the yacht would create the illusion of a four-pointed star sailing through the sky. Before you get too starry-eyed or starstruck or hitch your wagon to this particular STAR, know this: the design is still a concept for now and is just being assessed for technical feasibility. So any multi-billionaires out there who are interested in picking one up might do well to take the advice advice of Jiminy Cricket for now.

Online retailer Gilt will be selling the new watch this coming Friday and The Wall Street Journal has gotten a first look at the device. According to the Journal, the MB Chronowing will be available with leather, rubber, or nylon straps for $349, or with a crocodile strap and sapphire-glass crystal for a heftier $649. Neither version looks like a typical smartwatch — the MB Chronowing wouldn't look out of place in a glass case full of traditional chronometer-style watches. Its 44mm diameter makes it a pretty large watch, and the chunky bezel recalls Tag Heuer more than Dieter Rams Braun. The watch doesn't have a touchscreen and instead relies on a black and white LCD for notifications. It doesn't track your step count or have a microphone for voice commands. Bastian's approach to a smartwatch seems to be more in line with what Meta Watch is doing with the M1 than what Apple or Google are doing with their platforms. In addition to an LCD display, the MB Chronowing includes a clock dial for reading the time. The battery is said to last up to seven days between charges and the watch will work with both Android and iOS devices.   Image courtesy of The Wall Street Journal There are two camps in the smartwatch world: the ones that pack many features as possible into a wrist computer, and those that approach the smartwatch from the perspective of a traditional watch maker. Michael Bastian's watch falls firmly in that second camp, so it likely won't appeal to those lusting after a Moto 360 or Apple Watch.

According to a new report in The Wall Street Journal, Google plans to begin testing ""buy buttons"" that live inside the ads it puts above its normal search results. These sponsored results will reportedly take you to a special purchasing page that's still hosted by Google where you can pick what type of product you want, and how soon you want to get it — all without leaving Google itself. Meanwhile, the company will let you store your credit card information to do it all over again at another time. The program's existence was originally reported last December, but a few things have changed since then. Apparently Google will initially be testing this only on the mobile version of its results pages and not the desktop (because more people are visiting from their phones than desktops). It is also said that the feature will only be running on a ""small percentage"" of search traffic, at least initially. Google already aggregates product pricing information and offers sellers a way to promote their stores through Google Shopping. However that experience kicks you off the page and elsewhere when it's time to actually buy something. By comparison, you could buy things from this new system without ever actually visiting a store's site — something that's caused worries from companies that want control over customer information, as well as having people visit a site where they might end up buying other things. The Journal says Google is attempting to fend off both complaints by providing an option for shoppers to share their data (including payment credentials) with the stores, as well as for other items from those retailers to pop up on the special store pages. One of the first partners could be Macy's, which sells just about everything.

One lucky hire ""will be an integral part of the team that changes entertainment forever as Dish enters the wireless business and becomes the only provider that can offer wireless voice, video, and data."" Dish may be overselling its unique position a little. It's true that when it provides video to your home it uses a satellite dish that doesn't run a wire or cable to your TV. But that doesn't make it portable in the way we typically think of ""wireless."" The voice, data, and mobile video it could offer will likely be on par with what you could get from competitors as part of a package deal. Still, the fact that Dish plans to enter this market is good news, given the fact that there are only four major wireless carriers and two very dominant players. That brings us to the next wrinkle. AT&T has agreed to acquire DirectTV, which would bring it more directly into competition with Dish Network's traditional business. Google is hoping to offer wireless and fiber services. Verizon just bought itself a media company in AOL. Comcast has NBC-U.

Icahn's involvement in a company's affairs is often something that executives are wary of — he's infamous for his role as an activist investor, interested in making big changes at companies for his own profit — but that doesn't seem to be the case here. In fact, he makes the situation sound pretty straightforward to The Wall Street Journal. ""If you look at the way the market evaluates Uber and then look at the valuation of Lyft, Lyft is a tremendous bargain,"" Icahn says. ""There is room for two."" Lyft is currently valued at $2.5 billion, while Uber could soon hit $50 billion.  ""There is room for two."" That also explains why we're seeing Icahn invest in a startup, whereas he's usually focused on large, established companies. Icahn's investment doesn't change Lyft's valuation — it's being made as an extension of an earlier funding round — but it could help change the story when the startup next tries to raise money. Of Icahn's involvement, Lyft co-founder and president John Zimmer tells the Journal, ""As we look to the future to raise capital, whether it’s next year or whenever, that’s going to be a large validation."" A managing director of Icahn's company will also be added to Lyft's board of directors. Lyft still operates in significantly fewer cities than Uber — 65 in the US versus over 250 internationally — which means it has a lot of room to grow. Lyft also offers fewer services than Uber, primarily focusing on getting car owners with some spare time to be its drivers, rather than also offering a selection of formal taxi services the way Uber does (though Lyft is starting to expand into this market). That's part of Lyft's appeal, however.

That show brought in 176,676 people whom CEA refers to as ""industry professionals."" At next year's show that will be limited to 176,000 people. The CEA also says there will be additional vetting for anyone who didn't attend the show in the past two years. Unmentioned: it will still be very crowded ""With the growth of the consumer technology industry and the parallel growth of the International CES comes an increase in the qualified registrant base for our show. While these individuals are qualified industry professionals, we are reaching space capacity and simply can’t accommodate every qualified individual to our show,"" CEA senior vice president Karen Chupka said in a statement. ""These efforts also will allow us to improve some of the logistical and operational challenges that come with producing and attending such a large event."" The CEA telegraphed the move back in January, telling Bloomberg that it wanted to keep the show somewhere between 150,000 to 160,000 people, due in no small part to the strain it puts on hotels, taxis, and other parts of the city during that week in January. As a result, it planned a separate show in China, which takes place in Shanghai later this month. While notable for addressing the terror-filled fever dream that becomes most of the Las Vegas Convention Center once the crowds descend, it's worth noting that much of the conference's bread and butter business dealings take place elsewhere in the city, and can involve people who never set foot on the sprawling show floor. Companies hold briefings with the press, analysts, and conduct other business at nearby hotels, often before the official start of the show. That doesn't mean deals aren't made on pillow-soft carpets of the Convention Center though. There's been talk of limits before As CNET notes, the need to add limits is noteworthy given the pressure it was once under to grow its attendance. The economic downturn of 2008 trimmed the show's numbers, which stirred worries about the show's long-term viability. That was compounded by companies like Microsoft pulling out of the show to hold its own events on the side, much like Apple began doing with Macworld in 2008. At the time of the dip though, the CEA said it might simply keep the show at the smaller size, something that did not turn out to be the case. Despite the fresh warning, Chupka says the CEA won't ""turn qualified attendees away at the door.""

The story isn't a secret — in 2008, both companies didn't quite have their products worked out and were very low on cash — but Bloomberg has some revealing new quotes from Elon Musk, excerpted from Ashlee Vance's upcoming book Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, that underscore just how dire the situation had become.  ""If I split the money, maybe both of them would die."" ""I could either pick SpaceX or Tesla or split the money I had left between them,"" says Musk, founder of both companies. ""That was a tough decision. If I split the money, maybe both of them would die. If I gave the money to just one company, the probability of it surviving was greater, but then it would mean certain death for the other company. I debated that over and over."" Musk began knocking on every door he could, trying to chase down extra money for his two companies, according to Bloomberg. The excerpt makes it sound as though funding really came down to the wire, with SpaceX landing a NASA contract, Musk selling off some investments, and Tesla investors agreeing to give the company enough to keep moving. A $1.6 billion contract from NASA put SpaceX in the clear, while a new round of $40 million in funding is said to have saved Tesla on Christmas Eve, hours from burning through its last few hundred thousand dollars. During that time, Musk was also going through a very public divorce. Altogether, Musk says, ""I was just getting pistol-whipped.""

In an attempt to get a better picture of these disparities, the White House Council of Economic Advisers has released a new report on the so-called digital divide. The report uses data from the Census’ 2013 American Community Survey and the National Broadband Map. Segmenting the country into regions with 100,000 residents, the report found that in the most affluent sectors, 80 to 90 percent of households have internet at home. In the regions with the lowest median income, only about 50 percent do. The map gives a more detailed look at the inequalities of internet use, and income is one of the strongest determining factors. Many rural areas have high adoption rates while poorer urban neighborhoods have low ones. A 90-year-old in the top income quartile is more likely to have an internet connection than a person of any age in the bottom quartile. Geography plays a role too, and at first glance, the national map seems to paint a picture of rural and urban division. Densely populated regions have higher rates of internet adoption, while large swaths of the rural South and Southwest lag behind. However, the Great Plains and sparsely populated parts of Montana and and North Dakota also have high rates of adoption, and for such a dispersed country, the US does respectably: Norway and Switzerland are the only two members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development with both higher rates of internet use and a larger share of their population in rural areas, according to the report.  But when looking at broadband adoption overall, the US places 16th globally. And when you zoom in closer on the map, the divide looks less like one of urban and rural and more like one of class. For example, in several sections of central San Antonio, Texas, less than 65 percent of residents are online, while in sections of the northern suburbs, more than 83 percent are. The central sections are more densely populated but also poorer; the northern sections are more suburban, but wealthier. This relationship holds true nationally. Both geography and income correlate with internet adoption, but income appears to play a larger role. Going from regions in the bottom quarter ranked by population density to the top quarter results in a 9 percent increase in average internet adoption. But going from the bottom income quartile to the top results in a 24 percent increase. The findings fit with what Pew Research Center’s Lee Rainie has seen as well. ""Rural areas are less likely to have broadband access, but generally if you’re looking at non-adoption, socioeconomic factors are more determinative than geography,"" he says. ""Income and education are highly correlated with internet use."" Sometimes it’s simply a matter of not being able to afford internet service, Rainie says. The White House report doesn’t look at costs, but a 2010 FCC study found that 36 percent of people who weren’t online cited expense as the main reason. Often, Rainie says, it’s a general unfamiliarity with technology. In the same FCC study, 22 percent of non-adopters cited various forms of uneasiness with the internet, and another 19 percent said it was irrelevant to their lives. Since 2001, household internet access has gone from 50.6 percent to 74.4 percent. Gains have been greatest among demographic groups that were furthest behind, but inequalities persist. In 2013, the most recent year in the report, 77.4 percent of white households were online, compared to 61.3 percent of African-American ones. Only 43.8 percent of households with less than a high school education were online, compared to 90.1 percent of those with a college degree. ""Income and education are highly correlated with internet use."" ""When we first started doing our work in 2000, class distinctions were pretty pronounced, and people were actively talking about digital divides,"" Rainie says. ""Since then, adoption has occurred in every demographic group. But gaps remain. People who live in households with lower incomes and less education, those people are significantly less likely to be online."" Consequently, getting everyone online in the US will be a matter of affordability and education, says Raman Jit Singh Chima, policy director at Access Now. Increasing competition among service providers could help lower costs, he says, and extending the FCC Lifeline phone subsidy to cover broadband would put internet access within reach of more people. (Last month, the FCC began the process of extending the Lifeline program to cover broadband.)  Increasing internet access at schools and funding education programs at libraries and community centers would show more people how to get online and why doing so is useful. ""The most successful programs we hear about not only provide access but provide teaching and mentoring and tech support,"" says Pew’s Rainie. ""You need a whole web of support.""

The 14-second clip, uploaded to YouTube last Friday, claims to show a ""homemade multirotor with a semiautomatic handgun mounted on it."" The drone fires four times, with the recoil from each shot pushing it backwards in the air. If the footage is real, then the craft is certainly illegal — at least from the perspective of the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), which regulates aircraft and drones. ""We currently have rules in the books that deal with releasing anything from an aircraft, period,"" said FAA drone regulator Jim Williams back in 2013. ""Those rules are in place, and that would prohibit weapons from being installed on a civil aircraft."" ""[FAA rules] prohibit weapons from being installed on a civil aircraft."" This hasn't stopped people from playing around with the concept. After all, you can buy drones and you can buy guns; it only takes a small amount of technical know-how to join the two together. In 2013, for example, a clip appearing to show an octocopter with a Colt 45 handgun shooting various objects including a smartphone went viral. While the video was clearly a marketing stunt to sell screen protectors, it wasn't obvious whether the drone itself was actually firing the gun, or whether clever editing and blank cartridges had been used to make it appear this way. Howgwit, the YouTube user who uploaded the recent 14-second clip, also references another video showing a CGI quadcopter with a mounted machine gun on his Google+ account, commenting: ""Too bad it's fake... though I have a real one in my channel﻿."" Hogwit appears to be Austin Haughwout, a US drone hobbyist who was involved in a drone-rage incident last year. While flying a video-equipped drone at a beach, Haughwout got into a confrontation with a woman, Andrea Mears, who felt she was in danger from the craft. Footage of the incident went viral, and Mears was charged with third-degree assault before being granted probation. But while the FAA certainly doesn't want people mounting guns on quadcopters, there's no reason that people might try to claim this activity as their right. Does the Second Amendment apply to drones with guns? Legal scholars have already investigated similar claims covering robotic weapons, for example, with one law clerk, Dan Terzian, suggesting in a 2012 paper ""The Right to Bear (Robotic) Arms"" that there is a ""very real possibility of robots being [defined as] arms under current Second Amendment doctrine."" Presumably the same interpretation might also cover drones. Update: Both the FAA and local authorities have so far concluded that Haughwout broke no laws, although a federal investigation is still ongoing.

""While many middle-class US students go home to internet access, allowing them to do research, write papers, and communicate digitally with their teachers and other students, too many lower-income children go unplugged every afternoon when school ends,"" the White House said in a statement, first reported by Bloomberg. The announcement comes after a new report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers that shows income is still the biggest barrier to gaining broadband access, even over geography. Google Fiber will offer free service for low-income families in Atlanta, Durham, Kansas City, and Nashville, while Cox will offer broadband for $9.99 a month to families in cities including Macon, Georgia, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and New Orleans. The Department of Housing and Urban Development will also require new public housing developments to support broadband going forward.

Penned by staff writers and guest authors, none of Verge Fiction is real, nor should it be confused with news that regularly appears on this site.    1 STARSHIP GIRL Freya and her father go sailing. Their new home is in an apartment building that overlooks a dock on the bay at the west end of Long Pond. The dock has a bunch of little sailboats people can take out, and an onshore wind blows hard almost every afternoon. ""That must be why they call this town the Fetch,"" Badim says as they walk down to take out one of these boats. ""We always catch the brunt of the afternoon wind over the lake."" So after they've checked out a boat, they have to push it straight off the side of the dock into the wind, Badim jumping in at the last minute, hauling the sail tight until the boat tilts, then aiming it toward the little corniche around the curve of the lakeshore. Freya holds the tiller most firmly, as instructed. The boat leans over and they go right at the tall lake wall until they almost hit it, then Badim exclaims, ""Coming about,"" just as he said he would, and Freya swings the tiller hard and ducks to get under the boom as it swings over them, and then they're tacking in the other direction, in a reach across the end of the bay. The little sailboat can't point up into the wind very far, Badim says, and he calls it a tub, but affectionately. It's just big enough for the two of them, and has a single big sail, sleeved over a mast that to Freya looks taller than the boat is long. It takes quite a few tacks to get out of the little bay and into the wider expanse of Long Pond. Out there, all of Nova Scotia is visible to them: forested hills around a lake. They can see all the way to the far end of Long Pond, where afternoon haze obscures the wall. The deciduous trees on the hills are wearing their autumn colors, yellow and orange and scarlet all mixed with the green of the conifers. The prettiest time of year, Badim says. Their sail catches the bigger wind that rushes across the middle of the lake, which is silvery blue under the gusts. They shift to the windward side of the cockpit, lean out until they balance the boat against the wind. Badim knows how to sail. Quick shifts in the wind, to which they lean in or out; now they're dancing with the wind, as Badim puts it. ""I'm very good ballast,"" he says, rocking the boat a little as he moves. ""See, we don't want the mast straight up, but tilted downwind a bit. Same with the sail, not pulled as tight as you can, but off enough for the wind to curve across it the best. You can feel when it's right."" ""Look at the water there, Badim. Is that a cat's paw?"" ""Good eye, that is a cat's paw. Let's get ready for that, we're going to get wet!"" The surface of the lake winkles in a mirrorflake curl, approaching them fast, and when the gust causing the cat's paw hits them, the boat heels hard. They lean back into it and the boat gurgles forward, slaps into and across the oncoming waves, knocks up dashes of spray that blow back at them. Long Pond's water tastes like pasta, Badim says. At the end of forty tacks (Badim claims to keep count but with a smile that says he doesn't), they're just a kilometer or so up Long Pond. It's time to turn and make the straight run downwind to their dock. They turn and suddenly it's as if there's hardly any wind: the boat goes quiet, the sail bellies out ahead and to the side as Badim lets out the sheet, the little tub rocks forward in jerks and seems to be going slower. They watch the backs of waves pass them. The water is bluer now, and they can see farther down into it; sometimes they catch glimpses of the lake's bottom. The water bubbles and gurgles, the boat rocks awkwardly, all in all it feels like they're laboring, yet in no time at all they're coming back into their bay, and it's obvious by the way they pass the other docks and the corniche that they're really bombing along. There's time to watch their own dock come at them, and now in the bay they can again feel the wind rushing past, and hear the waves passing the boat, falling over in little gurgling whitecaps. ""Uhoh,"" Badim says as he leans out to see past their bellying sail. ""I should have come at the dock with the sail on the other side! I wonder if I can swing back out and get on the other beam, and come back in right."" But the dock is almost on them. ""Do we have time?"" Freya asks. ""No! Okay hold on, take the tiller and hold it just like it is now. I'm going to go forward and jump off onto the dock and grab the boat before you go by me! Keep your head down, don't let the boom hit you!"" And then they're heading right at the corner of the dock. Freya ducks into the seat and holds the tiller hard, the bow of the boat crashes into the corner of the dock while Badim is in the middle of his leap, he sprawls far onto the dock, there is a loud cracking sound where boom meets mast, the boat cants and swings around the dock, sail flapping hard out in front of the mast, the boom loose and flopping out there too. Badim scrambles to his feet and from the dock's side leans out to grasp the boat's bow, just within his reach, and then he has to lie flat on the dock and hang on. The boat swings around on the wind and points up into it, the sail swings around wildly and Freya ducks to get under it, but with the boom disconnected from the mast she has to jump down into the cockpit to get below it. ""Are you okay?"" Badim exclaims. Their faces are only a meter or two apart, and his look of dismay is enough to make her laugh. ""I'm okay,"" she assures him. ""What should I do?"" ""Come up into the bow and jump up onto the dock. I'll hold on."" Which he has to, because the boat is still trying to go downwind, but backward now, and into the shallows. People on the corniche are watching them. She jumps up beside him. Her push almost drags him off the dock; his knee is braced against a cleat in a way that looks painful to Freya, and indeed his teeth are clenched. She reaches out to help him pull the boat closer and he says, ""Don't catch your fingers between the boat and the dock!"" ""I won't,"" she says. ""Can you reach down in there, and get the rope in the bow?"" ""I think so."" He pulls hard, draws the boat in closer, she leans way out and snatches the rope where it goes through a metal ring in the very bow of the boat. She pulls the rope out of the boat and takes a turn around the cleat on the back corner of the dock, and Badim quickly snatches it and helps her take more turns. They lie there on the dock, staring face-to-face, eyes round. ""We broke the boat!"" Freya says. ""I know. You're okay?"" he asks. ""Yes. What about you?"" ""I'm fine. A bit embarrassed. And I'll have to help fix this boom. That's a very weak link though, I must say."" ""Can we go sailing again?"" ""Yes!"" He gives her a hug and they laugh. ""We'll do it better next time. The thing to do is to come in with the sail on the other side of the boat, so we can curve in toward the side of the dock, just ease across the wind and come in from the side, then turn up into the wind at the last second, and grab the side of the dock just as we're slowing down into the wind. Should have thought of that before."" ""Will Devi be angry?"" ""No. She'll be happy we're both safe. She'll laugh at me. And she'll know how to make that joint between the boom and mast stronger. Actually, I'd better look that thing up and find out what it's called. I'm pretty sure it has a name."" ""Everything has a name!"" ""Yes, I guess that's right."" ""And since that thing is broken, I think she's going to be a little angry."" Badim says nothing to this.   * * * The truth is, her mother is always angry. She hides it pretty well from most people, but Freya can always see it. It's there in the set of her mouth; also she often makes little impatient exclamations to herself, as if people can't hear her. ""What?"" she'll ask the floor, or a wall, and then go on as if she hasn't said anything. And she can get obviously mad really fast, like instantly. And the way she slumps in her chair in the evenings, staring grimly at the feed from Earth. Why do you watch it? Freya asked her one night. I don't know, her mother said. Someone has to. Why? The corners of her mother's mouth tightened, she put an arm around Freya's shoulders, heaved through her nose a big breath in, sigh out. I don't know. Then she trembled, and even started to cry, then stopped herself. Freya stared at the screen with its busy little figures, perplexed. Devi and Freya, staring at a screen showing life on Earth, from ten years before. * * * On this evening Freya and Badim come home and burst into their new apartment. ""We crashed the boat! We broke the thing!"" ""The gooseneck,"" Badim adds, with a quick smile at Freya. ""It connects the boom to the mast, but it isn't very robust."" Devi listens distracted, shakes her head at their wild story. She's chewing her salad in front of the screen. When she is done eating, the muscles at the back of her jaw stay bunched. ""I'm glad you're okay,"" she says. ""I've got to go back to work. There's some kind of thing going on at the lab."" ""I'm sure it has a name,"" Freya says primly. Devi eyes her, unamused, and Freya quails. Then Devi is off, back to the lab, and Badim and Freya slap hands and rattle around the kitchen getting out cereal and milk. ""I shouldn't have said that about the name,"" Freya says. ""Your mom has been known to have some edges,"" her father says, with an expressive lift of the eyebrows. He himself has no edges, as Freya knows very well. A short round balding man, with doggie eyes and a sweet low voice, mellow and interested. Badim is always there, always benign. One of the ship's best doctors. Freya loves her father, clings to him as to a rock in high seas. Clings to him now. He tousles her wild hair, so like Devi's, and says to her, as he has before, ""She has a lot of responsibilities, and it's hard for her to think about other things, to relax."" ""We're doing okay though, right, Badim? We're almost there."" ""Yes, we're almost there."" ""And we're doing okay."" ""Yes, of course. We will make it."" ""So why is Devi so worried?"" Badim looks her in the eye with a little smile. ""Well,"" he says, ""there are two parts to that, as I see it. First, there are things to worry about. And second, she is a worrier. It helps her to bring things up and talk through them, talk them out. She can't hold things inside very well."" Freya isn't so sure about this, because not many people seem to notice how mad Devi is. She's good at holding that inside, anyway. Freya says as much, and Badim nods. ""Good, that's right. She is good at holding in things, or ignoring things, up to a certain point, and then she needs to let it out, one way or another. We're all like that. So, we're her family, she trusts us, she loves us, so she lets us see how she really feels. So, we just have to let her do that, talk things out, say what she really feels, be how she really is. Then she can go forward. Which is good, because we need her. Not just you and me, though of course we need her too. But everybody needs her."" ""Everybody?"" ""Yes. We need her because the ship needs her."" He pauses, sighs. ""That's why she's so mad."" * * * Thursday, and so Freya goes into work with Devi rather than spending the day in the crèche with the little kids. She helps Devi on Thursdays. Freya feeds the ducks and turns the compost, and replaces batteries and lightbulbs sometimes, if they're scheduled for replacement. Devi does all kinds of things, indeed Devi does everything. Often this means talking to people who work in the biomes or on the machines in the spine, then looking at screens with them, then talking some more. When she's done she grabs Freya by the hand and pulls her along to the next meeting. ""What's wrong, Devi?"" Big sigh. ""I told you already. We started to slow down a few years ago, and it's changing things inside the ship. Our gravity comes from the ship rotating around the spine, and that creates a Coriolis effect, a little spiral push from the side. But now we're slowing down, and that's another force, about the same as the Coriolis effect in some ways, and cutting across it so it's reduced. You wouldn't think that would matter so much, but we're seeing aspects of it they didn't foresee. There was so much they didn't think about, that they left for us to find out."" ""That's good, right?"" Short laugh. Devi always makes the same sounds: Freya can call them up if she wants to, sometimes. ""Maybe so. It's good unless it's bad. We don't know how to do this part, we have to learn as we go. Maybe it's always that way. But we're in this ship and it's all we've got, so it has to work. But it's twelve magnitudes smaller than Earth, and that makes for some differences they never thought through. Tell me again about magnitudes?"" ""Ten times bigger. Or smaller!"" She remembers in time to keep Devi from saying it. ""That's right. So even one magnitude is a lot, right? And twelve, that's twelve zeros tacked on. A trillion. That's not a number we can imagine very well, it's too big. So, here we are in this thing."" ""And it has to work."" ""Yes. I'm sorry. I shouldn't burden you with this stuff. I don't want you to be scared."" ""I'm not scared."" ""Good. But you should be. So there's my problem."" ""But tell me why."" ""I don't want to."" ""Just a little bit."" ""Oh, I've told you before. It's always the same. Everything in here has to cycle in a balance. It's like the teeter-totters at the playground. There has to be an equilibrium in the back-and-forth between the plants and the carbon dioxide in the air. You don't have to keep it perfectly level, but when one side hits the ground you have to have some legs to push it back up again. And there are so many teeter-totters, all going at different speeds up and down. So you can't have any accidental moments when they all go down at once. So you have to look to see if that is about to start happening, and if so, you have to shift things around so that it doesn't. And our ability to figure out how to do that depends on our models, and really, it's too complex to model."" This thought makes her grimace. ""So we try to do everything by little bits and watch what happens. Because we don't really understand."" On this day it's the algae. They grow a lot of algae in big glass trays. Freya has looked at it through a microscope. Lots of little green blobs. Devi says some of it is mixed in with their food. They grow meat like the algae, in big flat tanks, and get almost as much of their food out of these tanks as they do out of the fields in the farming biomes. Which is lucky, because the fields can suffer animal disease, or crop failure. But the tanks can go wrong too. And they need their feedstocks to have something to turn into food. But the tanks are good. They have a lot of tanks going, in both rings, all kept isolated from the others. So they're all right. The algae tanks are green or brown or some mix of the two. The colors of things depend on which biome you're in, because the lights from the sunlines are different in different biomes. Freya likes to see the colors shift as they move from biome to biome, greenhouse to greenhouse, lab to lab. Wheat is blond in the Steppe, yellow in the Prairie. Algae in the labs is many different brownish greens. It's warm in the algae labs and smells like bread. Five steps to make bread. Someone says they're eating more these days, but growing less. This means an hour at least to talk it over, and Freya sits down to paint with the paints in the corner of the lab, left there for her and any other kids who might visit. Then off again. ""Where to now?"" ""Off to the salt mines,"" Devi declares, knowing Freya will be pleased; they'll stop at the dairy near the waste treatment plant, get ice cream. ""What is it this time?"" Freya said. ""More salt in the salty caramel?"" ""Yes, more salt in the salty caramel."" This is a stop where Devi can get visibly irate. The salt sump, the poison factory, the appendix, the toilet, the dead end, the graveyard, the black pit. Devi has worse names for it she says under her breath, thinking again that no one can hear her. Even the fucking shithole! The people there don't like her either. There is too much salt in the ship. Nothing wants salt except people, and people want more than they should have, but they're the only ones who can take it without getting sick. So they all have to eat as much salt as they can without overdoing it, but that doesn't really help, because it's a really short loop and they excrete it back into the larger system. Devi always wants long loops. Everything needs to loop in long loops, and never stop looping. Never pile up along the way in an appendix, in a poisonous sick disgusting stupid cesspool, in a slough of despond, in a fucking shithole. Devi sometimes fears she herself will sink into a slough of despond. Freya promises to pull her out if she does. So they don't like chlorine, or creatinine, or hippuric acid. The bugs can eat some of these things and turn them into something else. But the bugs are dying now, and no one knows why. And Devi thinks the ship is short on bromine, which she can't understand. And they can't fix nitrogen. Why does nitrogen break so often? Because it's hard to fix! Ha-ha. Phosphorus and sulfur are just as bad. They really need their bugs for these. So the bugs have to stay healthy too. Even though they're not enough. For anyone to be healthy, everyone has to be healthy. Even bugs. No one is happy unless everyone is safe. But nothing is safe. This strikes Freya as a problem. Anabaena variabilis is our friend! You need machines and you need bugs. Burn things to ash and feed the ash to the bugs. They're too small to see until there are zillions of them together. Then they look like mold on bread. Which makes sense because mold is one kind of bug. Not one of the good ones; well, bad but good. Bad to eat anyway. Devi doesn't want her eating moldy bread, yuck! Who would do that? You can get two hundred liters of oxygen a week from one liter of suspended algae, if it is lit properly. Just two liters of algae will make enough oxygen for a person. But they have 2,122 people on board. So they have other ways to make oxygen too. There's even some of it stored in tanks in the walls of the ship. It's freezing cold but stays as liquid as water. The algae bottles are shaped like their biomes. So they're like algae in a bottle! This makes Devi laugh her short laugh. All they need is a better recyclostat. The algae always have bugs living with them, eating them as they grow. With people it's the same, but different. Growing just a gram of Chlorella takes in a liter of carbon dioxide and gives out 1.2 liters of oxygen. Good for the Chlorella, but the photosynthesis of algae and the respiration of humans are not in balance. They have to feed the algae just right to get it between eight and ten, where people are. Back and forth the gases go, into people, out of people, into plants, out of plants. Eat the plants, poop the plants, fertilize the soil, grow the plants, eat the plants. All of them breathing back and forth into each other's mouths. Loops looping. Teeter-totters teetering and tottering all in a big row, but they can't all bottom out on the same side at the same time. Even though they're invisible! The cows in the dairy are the size of dogs, which Devi says is not the way it used to be. They're engineered cows. They give as much milk as big cows, which were as big as caribou back on Earth. Devi is an engineer, but she never engineered a cow. She engineers the ship more than any animals in the ship. They grow cabbages and lettuce and beets, yuck! And carrots and potatoes and sweet potatoes, and beans that are so good at fixing nitrogen, and wheat and rice and onions and yams and taro and cassava and peanuts and Jerusalem artichokes, which are neither artichokes nor from Jerusalem. Because names are just silly. You can call anything anything, but that doesn't make it so.   * * *    Devi is called away from one of her regular meetings to deal with an emergency again, and as it's one of Freya's days with her, she brings Freya along. First they go to her office and look at screens. What kind of emergency is that? But then Devi snaps her fingers and types like crazy and then points at one screen, and they hurry around to one of the passageways between biomes, the one between the Steppes and Mongolia that is called Russian Roulette, and is painted blue and red and yellow. The next one along is called the Great Gate of Kiev. The tall, short tunnel between the doors to the lock is crowded this morning with people, and a number of ladders and scaffolding towers and cherry-pickers. Devi joins the crowd under the scaffolding, and Badim shows up a bit later to keep Freya company. They watch as a group of people ascend one of the scaffold ladders, following Devi up to the ceiling of the tunnel, right next to the lock-door frame. There several panels have been pulled aside, and now Devi climbs up into the hole where the panels have been moved, disappearing from sight. Four people follow her into the hole. Freya had no idea that the ceiling did not represent the outer skin of the lock, and stares curiously. ""What are they doing?"" Badim says, ""Now that we're decelerating, that new little push is counteracting the Coriolis force that our spin creates, and that's a new kind of pressure, or release from pressure. It's made some kind of impediment in the lock door here, and Devi thinks they may have found what it is. So now they're up there seeing if she's right."" ""Will Devi fix the ship?"" ""Well, actually I think the whole engineering team will be involved, if the problem turns out to be up there. But Devi's the one who spotted this possibility."" ""So she fixes things by thinking about them!"" This was one of their family's favorite lines, a quote from some scientist's admiring older relatives, when he was a boy repairing radios. ""Yes, that's right!"" Badim says, smiling. Six hours later, after Badim and Freya have gone into the Balkans for a lunch at its east end dining hall, the repair crew comes down out of the hole in the lock ceiling, handing down some equipment, then putting a few small mobile robots into baskets to be lowered by the scaffold. Devi comes down the ladder last and shakes hands all around. The problem has been located, and fixed with torches, saws, and welders. The long years of Coriolis push shifted something slightly out of position, and recently the counterforce of deceleration shifted it back, but meanwhile the rest of the door had gotten used to the shift. It all made sense, although it didn't speak volumes about the quality of construction and assembly of the ship. They were going to check all the other slides like the broken one, to make sure the lock doors of Ring B weren't impeded in other places. Then they won't stress motors trying to close doors against resistance. Devi hugs Freya and Badim. She looks worried, as always. ""Hungry?"" Badim asks. ""Yes,"" she says. ""And I could use a drink."" ""It's good that's fixed,"" Badim remarks on the walk home. ""That's for sure!"" She shakes her head gloomily. ""If the lock doors were to get stuck, I don't know what we'd do. I must say, I'm not impressed by the people who built this thing."" ""Really? It's quite a machine, when you think about it."" ""But what a design. And it's just one thing after another. It's pillar to post. I just hope we can hang on till we get there."" ""Deceleration mode, my dear. It won't be much longer."" * * * The Coriolis force is the push sideways that you can't feel. Whether you can feel it or not, however, it still pushes the water. So now that the water has the deceleration pushing it sideways, they have to pump water across to the other sides of biomes to get it to where it used to go. They have to replace the force in ways that don't actually work very well in comparison to it. They planned for this with their pumping of water, but they haven't been able to make up for the altered pushes inside plant cells, which some plants are turning out not to like. There was a little push inside every cell that is altered now. Which is maybe why things are getting sick. It doesn't make sense, but then neither does anything else. On Devi goes, talking and talking as they make their rounds. ""It's not the Coriolis force that matters, it's the Coriolis effects. Those were never accounted for except in people, as if people are the only ones who feel things!"" ""How could they have been so stupid?"" Freya says. ""Exactly! Maybe all the cell walls will hold, so maybe it isn't obvious, but the water! The water!"" ""Because water always moves."" ""Exactly! Water always flows downhill, water always takes the path of least resistance. And now we've got a new downhill."" ""How could they be so stupid?"" Devi seizes her around the shoulders as they walk, hugs her. ""I'm sorry, I'm just worried is all."" ""Because there are things to worry about."" ""That's right, there are. But I don't have to afflict you with them."" ""Will you have some salty caramel ice cream?"" ""Of course. You couldn't stop me. You couldn't stop me with twenty years of fusion bombs going off twice a second!"" This is how they are slowing the ship down. As always, they laugh at how crazy this is. Luckily the bombs are very teeny. They meet Badim at the dairy, and learn that there's a new flavor of ice cream there, Neapolitan, which has three flavors combined. Freya is confused trying to think this through. ""Badim, will I like that?"" He smiles at her. ""I think you will."" * * * After the Neapolitan ice cream, on to the next stop on Devi's rounds. Algae labs, the salt mine, the power plant, the print shop. If everything is going well, they'll choose some item that has come up on the parts swap-out list, and go through Amazonia to Costa Rica, where the print shop is, and arrange for one of the printers to print out the part to be swapped out, and then they'll go to wherever the part belongs, and switch on the backup system, if there is one, or simply turn off whatever it is and hurry to take out the old part and put in the new part. Gears, filters, tubes, bladders, gaskets, springs, hinges. When they're done and the system is turned back on, they'll study the old part to see how well it has endured, and where it has worn; they'll take photos of it, and talk its diagnosis into the ship's record, and then take the part to the recycling rooms, which are right next to the print shop, and provide the printers with many of their feedstocks. That's when things are going well. But usually, not everything is going well. Then it's a matter of troubleshooting, grasping the bull by the horns, seizing the nettle, coping and hoping, damning torpedoes, and trying any old thing, including the engineer's solution, which is to hit things with a hammer. On really bad days, they even have to hope the whole shithouse doesn't come down on their heads! Have to hope they don't end up living like savage beasts, eating trash or their own dead babies!

I battle late into the night and squeeze in a game or two over breakfast. Several times over the past year and a half I deleted the game from my computer, tablet, and mobile phone, vowing to devote those hours to work and family, read a goddamn novel, or finish that long suffering book proposal which had been gestating in Google Docs. But I would always relapse. One more game. A peek at the newest expansion. Just a taste to get me through this long airplane flight. The mechanics of Hearthstone are familiar to anyone who has played Magic: The Gathering. You build a deck of 30 cards comprised of creatures and spells. Each turn you draw a card and add one point of resources you can spend to put cards from your hand into play. Creatures and spells can do damage to other creatures or players, who each begin with 30 points of life. It has elements of chess and poker with the flavor of a fantasy novel and the added narcotic of a collectible like baseball cards. The combination, for me at least, is too potent to resist. Get 'em young, keep 'em loyal Hearthstone is made by Blizzard and set in the world of Warcraft, a gaming universe that Blizzard began back in 1994, and which gave me my first taste of game addiction. I have a vivid memory of a weekend when I was perhaps 13 or 14 years old; my parents were going out of town for 24 hours visiting friends, and I was left to my own devices. I had just purchased Warcraft II for $60 from J&R Computers with several months of saved allowance. Get ‘em young and keep ‘em loyal. From the moment my parents left, I was playing. I did not sleep, or finish my homework, or stop much to eat. I played with the single-minded focus of a junkie deep into a session until, abruptly, my computer crashed. I stumbled out of the dream to realize that my folks would be home in less than two hours. I was shocked. I had never before experienced a complete loss in my sense of time. The hours had felt like minutes. I was still hungry for more. I tell myself it's under control Hearthstone has never treated me to quite such a brutal binge. My relationship with the game is closer to that of a chain smoker who tells himself that one or two couldn’t hurt and ends up finishing the whole pack. Occasionally it gets to a level that irritates or concerns my wife, but it hasn’t damaged our relationship. I spend lots of time with my kids, and I manage to write big feature stories for a well-respected website. I tell myself I’ve got everything under control. Instead of playing at work, I keep a Twitch stream of other people enjoying Hearthstone running in the background. It’s my patch, my piece of gum, close enough to keep me from breaking the rules but also maintaining the presence of the addictive chemical in my system at all times.  Why do I find Hearthstone so pleasurable and irresistible? I’ve thought about this a lot, hell this whole piece is an attempt to pin down an answer. Getting lost in a video game isn’t exclusive to Hearthstone for me, it’s part of my overall personality. But I cannot remember any other computer game I played for more than a year without eventually getting bored and setting it aside, at least temporarily in favor of something new. Revisiting an old mistress The game is based on the collectible card game format made popular by Magic: The Gathering, which I also played obsessively as a kid. I recently tried out the new online offerings from Magic and the differences with Hearthstone helped to sharpen my understanding of what makes Blizzard’s game so special and so addictive. Hearthstone is equal parts skill and luck. Like poker, the best players will win more often. But even an idiot can draw the perfect hand. I find that this makes for matches which are supremely frustrating, exhilarating, and on many occasions, laugh out loud hilarious. The advantage can swing back and forth in an instant, something that, at least in my experience is not true of most competitive video games. There is none of the persistent grinding and tactical precision of CounterStrike or League of Legends here. As I played through Magic: The Gathering’s new digital game earlier this month, it became clear that no matter how well the game is adapted for a digital format, it will never work as well as a native like Hearthstone. The key difference is that Hearthstone can include an element of random selection, in which cards that neither player has in their deck enter the field of play. Cards can appear that suddenly provide you the winning boost or accidentally undermine a carefully laid plan. Lady luck deals in dopamine On Monday, Hearthstone released a new expansion, The Grand Tournament, setting off a debate within the community that occurs anytime the substance or structure of a game is tweaked, especially one with a competitive element where players can earn millions in prize money. Some felt that too many of the new cards were bad, others that too many of the new cards were too powerful. Some wished that old cards had been introduced instead of new versions that were identical in resource cost but higher in power. Digital tweaks have heightened the potency This is a natural part of the ecosystem around competitive card games. But what struck me was the realization that while many cards were too ""bad"" to see any play in a competitive setting, the random elements of the game ensure that they will still make their way onto the field. When that happens, players are faced with a sudden boon or unintentional handicap that they will need to play around. A ""bad"" card becomes an interesting challenge. Hearthstone includes two other formats, Arena and Tavern brawl, where players are given a random selection of cards or a wacky format that changes each week. Both eliminate the need for players to have any cards in their collections. This solves another big problem in Magic, which is that you need to invest a lot of time and money into the game before you can become competitive and play with the rarest and most interesting cards. I’ve digressed from writing about my addiction to a lengthy explanation of why I love this game so much, and if you think I wasn’t playing quick games of Hearthstone while writing this piece, you might be on your own drug of choice. Still, I hope there was some genuine catharsis that will come out of publicly discussing my struggle. If you want to share your story, please do in the comments. And if you feel like playing a quick game of Hearthstone, I’m always around.",0.5872002021539752,0.41279979784602483,0.18587364179045932,1185,4.616877637130802,591,5.94585448392555,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Essay"

It's a weird name, but the term just describes shows like American Horror Story and True Detective that change their cast, setting, and story from season to season, while still maintaining the same themes and structure. For the most part, we've seen anthology series focus on specific genres, like horror and mystery, but now HBO is beginning to bring it something a bit simpler: family dramas.  Like True Detective, but without all the murder HBO has started working on a project that is literally just called Family Drama and will follow a different family each season, according to The Wrap. The same basic elements will remain each time around: the families will all live in Seattle, and the seasons will all kick off after some major event in the family starts to change things. That's about as generic as you can get — stories typically begin amid changes, after all — but the point is really just that HBO has an excuse to make a more character-oriented drama. The intention may be to build the series' name up in the way that True Detective did, allowing it to attract major talent. The project comes from Lynn Shelton, who's directed several episodes of New Girl, The Mindy Project, and Fresh off the Boat, as well as several indie films including last year's Laggies, which starred Keira Knightley. She'll be working on the show with a couple of others, including an executive producer of True Blood. Shelton will be a writer for the series and also intends to direct the pilot. That said, this is still just an early project that HBO is working on — and HBO's project very frequently do not come to fruition.

If there was ever a show defined by its performances, it’s this one: Britney, Christina, and Madonna kissing! Britney lurching her way through ""Gimme More"" like an exhausted husk just a few years later! Beyoncé rubbing her growing belly while her loyal subjects applaud the future princess! Even at an advanced age — this is the 32nd annual show — the VMAs are expertly engineered at least one memorable moment a year. For the show’s performers, the VMA stage can serve as a sort of test, and that’s true no matter the stage of their career. Are they ready to assume the mantle of musical stardom? Can they silence the haters with a performance that brings out something new in their music? Can they deliver not only hits, but talking points? With those kinds of stakes in mind, I’m going to go through this year’s full slate of performers and rate the pressure that’s being placed on them this year using varying scales from 1 to 10. Let’s begin: Demi Lovato: Demi has a ton of goodwill thanks to the success of ""Cool for the Summer,"" but she could use a defining, powerful vocal performance to drive the song home. She has the pipes — if you were a Camp Rock fan like I was, you've known she can wail for a long time — but she's never had to show up on anything like the VMA stage. I'm hoping she can pull it together, and that her plan for doing so involves blowing everyone off the stage with the kind of singing I know she can do. 6/10 Justin Bieber: This is bound to be one of the night’s bigger performances. Bieber needs a strong showing here to seal in the transition from petulant child star to penitent, talented artist he’s been working on throughout the year. New single ""What Do You Mean?"" is solid, but it’s not exactly dependent on his charisma or vocal skill. If he can show those qualities off at the VMAs, it’s going to help the song grab hold of the charts and grant him some legitimacy; if not, he might be relegated to EDM hook work for the next half-decade. The clock is ticking. 8/10 People will lose their minds if Kanye does one cool thing Kanye West: There’s going to be some scuttlebutt about Kanye needing to top what Beyoncé did last year after receiving the same award — she performed her whole damn album in 12 minutes — but it’s overblown. The whole point of the award is the recognition of his sustained excellence, and people will be primed to lose their minds given even a bare minimum of innovation; Kanye has a great sense of the moment, and I’m sure he has a visually engaging, daring mini-set planned. Most of the remaining questions, then, surround Swish, his long-awaited Yeezus follow-up: do we hear some new music? Does he trot out ""All Day"" and ""Wolves"" like they didn’t land with a miserable thud earlier this year? Is Paul McCartney going to be there? I demand answers! 7/10 Macklemore & Ryan Lewis: Many people watching the show will be expecting this to be terrible — so if it’s mediocre (or better?), that’s a victory for Seattle’s finest. New single ""Downtown"" was widely panned when it was released earlier this week, which sounds bad at first... until you realize it pushed the bar for this performance even lower. The ecstasy of low expectations! 1/10 Nicki Minaj: If we’re lucky, Nicki will take a performance characterized by grace, charm, and professionalism and cap it off with a single withering glance in the general direction of host / provocateur / occasional dingus Miley Cyrus. (Cyrus gave the world the gift of her opinion regarding Nicki’s Twitter spat with Taylor Swift earlier this week.) With that said, I don’t think there’s actually any real pressure here — Nicki is widely beloved, she’s comfortable and experienced in this context, and The Pinkprint is over half a year out from its release. She doesn’t have to prove anything. 5/10 Pharrell Williams: I can only assume Pharrell’s going to perform ""Freedom,"" his Apple Music exclusive that got played about once every half-hour on Beats 1’s launch day, to which I have just one response: who cares? I’m getting a snack during this one unless he comes on stage wearing a hat the size of Ariana Grande, and even then I’m only staying for a second or two. 1/10 The Weeknd: This is, without a doubt, the most important performance of the night. The giant wave of molly water and late night tears Abel Tesfaye’s ridden to the top of the charts is cresting, but he needs a signature show to lock it in; every nascent pop king needs a coronation. (It’d be silly to bet on anything other than ""Can’t Feel My Face"" for his number, but I’m hoping against hope he performs ""Tell Your Friends,"" a song that contains one of the most concise and effective statements of self in recent memory: ""I’m that nigga with the hair / singing ‘bout poppin’ pills, fuckin’ bitches, livin’ life so trill."" It’ll never happen.) There’s a chance we look back on this moment as the few minutes where Tesfaye seized control of pop for the next few years; it’s either that, or he slinks back to a Toronto penthouse for more lechery. 10/10",0.8766209318939878,0.12337906810601218,0.23166440776103334,939,4.6709265175718846,542,5.7343173431734318,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Music, VMA 2015 "

His first mixtape, House of Balloons, was released for free on his website in March of 2011. The tape was as gritty and dark as Tesfaye’s voice was angelic, its sex appeal came with a sidelong threat of violence. The combination was arresting; every corner of the music world perked up its ears. MTV called it the best album of the year. It got a co-sign from Drake. In the months that followed, he released two more free mixtapes, Thursday and Echoes of Silence, both of which dug even deeper into Tesfaye’s seedy, confessional world. Curiosity about who, exactly, The Weeknd was skyrocketed, fueled by Tesfaye’s initial refusal to give any press interviews or even show his face.  Eventually, of course, the mystery ended. By the time The Weeknd’s first studio album, Kiss Land, came out in the fall of 2013, he had signed to a major label (Republic) and formed his own imprint (XO). He performed at Drake’s OVO fest. The blank space in our popular imagining of him was replaced with Tesfaye’s now-iconic towering hair.   But Tesfaye still hadn’t quite reached pop star status, in part because he always seemed to intentionally quarantine himself on the darkest fringes of R&B. That changes with Beauty Behind the Madness, his second studio album, out today. The Weeknd is definitively a pop star now. The album’s first single, ""Can’t Feel My Face,"" landed him in the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time ever. One listen to the song — plus the fact that hit-single-factory Max Martin produced it — makes it clear that this was The Weeknd’s plan all along. ""Can’t Feel My Face"" has an actual hook (The Weeknd usually settles for a post-coital whimper), and Tesfaye’s normally subdued vocals gallop through the song like he’s panting for airplay. The song made its live debut at Apple's WWDC in June, surrounded by men talking about the future of music who probably didn’t know who he was in 2011. So the mystery is gone. But the initial lure of The Weeknd was the way he (and his music) lurked in the shadows. When he was still anonymous, Tesfaye created a persona: a man who stays at the club 'til it closes and then some, but never dances. A man who lives in a world populated by dozens of dead-eyed women who can match him pound for pound when it comes to drug use, but only when they’re not trying to fuck him. He’s strange and solitary, but he’s almost never alone. The Weeknd is a character actor — he plays villains, tortured souls, and guys who sleep 'til noon in luxury hotel rooms, and he does it with a deranged sincerity. He sings about sex with blunt anatomical correctness and describes drugs like they’re medicine. All Tesfaye’s vices were out there for all to see, with very little in the way of justification. But on Beauty Behind the Madness, fueled by his newfound popularity, The Weeknd tries to convince us the world he’s lived in for years is more complex than we originally thought.  The album’s opening track is ""Real Life""; it begins with a warped guitar that sounds like an emergency alarm going off in a factory. The production is slick, the synths warbling. Tesfaye sounds apologetic, but resigned: ""Mama called me destructive / Said it’d ruin me one day / Cause every woman that loved me / I seem to push them away."" In the very next song, ""Losers,"" a jazzy track with a keyboard backbone, the UK singer Labrinth reminds listeners that ""stupid’s next to ‘I love you.’"" That’s followed up with the Kanye West-produced ""Tell Your Friends."" The song is classic Tesfaye: cymbals lead the percussion, his vocals are near-perfect, and it doesn’t even seem like he’s trying. The premise of the song is classic Tesfaye, too; lackadaisically encouraging his conquests to brag to their friends that they had sex with him. This kind of emotional jockeying seems insane, largely because The Weeknd approaches everything straight on, with no hint of subtlety. In The Weeknd’s world, women are either one-dimensional (keepers of the pussy) or evil (destroyers of the dick), but Tesfaye positions himself as anything he wants to be, and he wants to be a man with secrets. As listeners, we’re meant to be intrigued by these secrets, even if their basis in reality is unclear. Beauty Behind the Madness is not thematically complex, but The Weeknd has shaped its setting (dark, drunk) so that we might think it is. Tesfaye wants us to confuse memoir for metaphor. But mainstream pop has always relied on metaphor and double entendre, and Tesfaye finds ways to work it into his more PG-13 material. ""Earned It,"" a track with so much grinding percussion it hurts your teeth, was on the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack. Lana Del Rey appears on a track to call herself a ""prisoner of addiction"" — a line that makes you wonder why The Weeknd hasn’t collaborated with her before. And then there’s Ed Sheeran, the male Little Orphan Annie, who really couldn’t be anything but out of place on ""Dark Times,"" despite co-writing the track. (Sheeran singing about his ""dark times"" seems laughable in the inimitably dark after-hours world The Weeknd lives in.)  There are times when The Weekend hammers at his self-imposed narrative so incessantly it’s almost goofy. Take ""Acquainted,"" a murky club insta-hit with a chorus that includes the line, ""To say we’re in love is dangerous, but girl I’m so glad we’re acquainted."" It’s one of the best songs on Beauty Behind the Madness, but that sentiment, and specifically the use of ""acquainted,"" is funny, because what he really means is fucking. If the song had been a 2011 Thursday cut, he might have just said ""fucking."" ""Often,"" a slow jam that’s been out for more than a year already, is literally about having sex ""often."" That’s also funny. But Tesfaye is so unwavering, it’s hard to believe both tracks aren’t at least a little tongue-in-cheek. On Beauty Behind the Madness, The Weeknd reshapes his sound for the shiny masses, but conserves his nihilistic sensibility for the dirty underground. If he’s trying to convince the masses they belong there too, he’ll have to be a little more forthcoming. But The Weeknd really is a pop star now, and pop stars can only go so dark.",0.5829312853430291,0.41706871465697093,0.808623066756304,1090,4.8082568807339445,591,5.9932318104906939,0,4,"Culture, Entertainment, Music, Music Review"

Open an account, make topical jokes, follow thousands of comedians, flatter those more famous than you to curry favor and get retweets, repeat. With luck, dedication, and a good sense of humor, the aspiring comic had a diminutive, but real shot. I say this used to be the method, because in the past couple years, stories about junior agents at CAA, UTA, and WME taking risks on Twitter talent have given way to other fads. And that appeared to be that. People wanting fame moved on to Vine or Instagram, or returned to YouTube or Tumblr. Fast fame, short tweets But a single tweet — yes, this is a story about a single tweet; pray for me — has made the rounds over the past 48 hours that may be emblematic of Twitter's lasting power as a democratic tool for electing our entertainers. On Wednesday, Nic Vargus, a former employee of IGN, now a writer at Apple, posted a tweet claiming he'd brokered a deal with his fiancée: should that tweet accrue 100,000 retweets, he would have permission to ""dress up as a ninja turtle on [their] wedding day."" My girlfriend says if this tweet gets 100k RTs, she'll let me dress up as a ninja turtle on our wedding day.  As I write this piece, the tweet has 119,658 retweets, so Vargus’ bid for attention has been validated. We now may look forward to Vargus' wedding day, and the videos and photos that will produce countless Tweets, Grams, and Vines; then we'll have the BuzzFeed article aggregating all of those social keepsakes (You have to see this groom's ninja turtle costume — and the bride's loving smile); then will come the Gawker article letting us know if we should hate it or love it (Manchild Apple employee dresses as Ninja Turtle at wedding); and finally a handful of blogs will let us know what this all means about marriage, or the indignity of the modern man, or our refusal to be adults (Dressing like children's cartoon character at your wedding? Time to grow up). Viral stories have a trajectory This is the viral story timeline. It's proven; it's true. But what's unique this go around is that we — or at least 120,000 of us — choose to make it happen. Because we — consciously or not — predict how the internet will react to a man dressed as a ninja turtle at his wedding, and by retweeting his pitch, we give our vote of confidence. I say ""pitch"" in the most let's sip expensive bottled water in a Los Angeles meeting room sense of the word. The only difference between Vargus' tweet and an elevator spiel at E! or VH1 is the lack of suits. Vargus went directly to the audience in his request for celebritydom, and the plan worked. Even if Vargus' tweet was meant as a disposable goof that became a real thing on its own — which may be half true, though Vargus nurtured the tweet's success along the way — it now exists as a replicable path to fame. Think of it like a Kickstarter for reality television, but instead of money, all you need to donate is your support. At the end, you'll be awarded exactly what we want from our most guilty reality pleasure: a grown human humiliating themselves for a fleck of adulation and a mountain of popularity. Surely an enterprising junior agent has already figured out how to spin this into a promotion.",0.6460949444341826,0.3539050555658174,0.19326723779735808,601,4.5474209650582367,357,5.6246498599439771,0,0,

I'm Jamieson, I'm still your host, and I’m looking forward to this Sunday night’s MTV Video Music Awards hijinks. Between the performers and the presenters, almost every member of the musical elite will be there — and you’ll find one of them in the selections below, too. As per usual, there's a Spotify playlist at the end for your listening convenience, and you're also welcome to share your own favorite cuts, comments, and complaints in the comments. Let's go: AFX, ""simple slamming b 2"":  Richard D. James has been on a tear since making a comeback with last year’s Syro, his first full-length as Aphex Twin in 13 years. The EP-length Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments pt2 followed shortly after, and now James is back with Orphaned Deejay Selek 2006-2008, his first release as AFX in almost a decade. ""simple slamming b 2"" is one of the best tracks on the EP, and it does exactly what it says on the package: you’re pinned to the wall by a relentless, mechanical rhythm within a few seconds, the sort of ""simple slamming"" that underpins James’ alien synth work. This song was ostensibly made between 2006 and 2008, but you could have added or subtracted a decade and I never would have been able to guess. All of James’ work has that rootless, detached quality. Baroness, ""Chlorine & Wine"":  Baroness are a moody Virginia foursome that like to dance around the edges of ""metal,"" coloring that genre with rock, folk, and progressive elements. A month after releasing double album Yellow & Green in 2012, the band was involved in a severe car accident in England. ""Chlorine & Wine"" is their first bit of music since that accident, and it’s also the lead single from their new album Purple, which is due out on December 18th. If you were scared off by the use of ""metal,"" above, don’t be: this is curious, warm, and approachable music, with a real sense of scale and some fantastic riffs. I’m glad the band’s back to full health and recording again. Carly Rae Jepsen, ""I Didn’t Just Come Here to Dance"":  I’m sure you’re sick of seeing Carly Rae Jepsen in this space, but forget about that for a second:  The sun’s still high in the sky, E•MO•TION’s still fresh in our ears, your friends are still wondering why you’re listening to the girl from ""Call Me Maybe"" so much. ""I Didn’t Just Come Here to Dance"" is a bonus track, and it’s pure house heaven: hammy keyboard melodies, a delirious vocal take, references to ostensible dancefloor gods Joe and Tino. You’re going to like this song, even if you’re neither Joe nor Tino. Deradoorian, ""Violet Minded"":  Deradoorian has popped up here before too, and her new record The Expanding Flower Planet is now available in full if you’re interested in hearing more. This is my favorite song on it, one that combines the intricacy and melody of her work as a member of Dirty Projectors with the placid, psychedelic feel of her solo work since. The clusters of vocal harmony on this song are rich, full-bodied, layered — you can hear something different every time you rewind, and it’s irresistible. Floating Points, ""Silhouettes"":  This is the first single from the British producer’s debut full-length, Elaenia, which is coming out in November. It’s not a true single, though — it’s just folding in pieces of a much longer track, ""Silhouettes (I, II, III),"" one whose three phases stretch over almost 11 minutes. If you like the jazzy, luxurious feel of the video, I recommend giving the extended version a spin. It does justice to Shepherd’s ambition, gives the song bigger peaks and valleys, lets you immerse yourself like you’re sitting at the bottom of a swimming pool. (It’s included in the full playlist below.) Julia Holter, ""Sea Calls Me Home"":  Speaking of water: the ocean’s never sounded more inscrutable, or appealing, than on this new single from Julia Holter. (Between this and the new record from Deradoorian mentioned above, it’s a good week for art-pop.) I love when artists do what Holter does here: render the everyday arcane, the natural mysterious. It can turn a place you know and love into something completely new if you hear it in the right spot. I don’t get to spend a lot of time near the water, but hearing Holter holler, ""I can’t swim! Its lucidity! So clear!"" could get me to find some sort of deeper meaning in a kiddie pool. Justin Bieber, ""What Do You Mean?"":  If you’ve managed to remain unaware of this song’s existence despite using the internet regularly in the last week, I applaud you — Bieber’s enlisted the help of everyone from Ben Stiller and Alec Baldwin to Britney Spears and Martha Stewart for its promotion. Is ""What Do You Mean?"" worth all the hype? I can’t make that decision for you, but this song is just fine: it’s buoyant, capably sung tropical house. Bieber still doesn’t have heft in his voice, but he’s acquired a little bit of grain, and he knows enough to coast and let the featherlight arrangement do the work. It’s no ""Where Are Ü Now,"" but it doesn’t have to be; I’m sure it’ll be everywhere in no time. Mick Jenkins, ""Get Up Get Down"":  Chicago rapper Mick Jenkins released a new EP last week, Wave[s], and this is my favorite thing on it. It moves through two phases, opening with bubbly, kinetic neo-soul before scaling back and letting Jenkins take the reins; I can’t decide which I like more. He has a resonant, impactful voice, and he flips the titular chart from a near-inspirational burst of joy into something dark and boozy. It’s a neat trick from a promising artist. OMI, ""Hula Hoop"":  There’s life after ""Cheerleader""! I have to give OMI a ton of credit for ""Hula Hoop,"" a song that builds on the glory of his massive summer hit without copying it outright. It’s going to make great fodder for remixes, because there are a ton of little catchy bits embedded within the song that aren’t getting used to their full potential; it’s got the same genial, romantic feel that made ""Cheerleader"" this summer’s fidelity anthem. And OMI sounds fantastic, stripped of affectation and sitting right at the front of the mix. Summer’s almost over, but the sun feels a little warmer when I listen to this. Sexwitch, ""Helelyos"":  I’d love to go out on that note, but we’re closing with something a little moodier. Sexwitch is a new project from Bat for Lashes’ Natasha Khan, collaborator TOY, and producer Dan Carey, and its debut EP (out September 25th) is a collection of six ‘70s psych-folk covers pulled from all over the world. ""Helelyos"" is a 40-year-old Iranian song, but it sounds like it could’ve come from Khan’s pen yesterday, with the sort of intensity and enigmatic energy that made The Haunted Man such an exciting listen. Here’s this week’s playlist — have a lovely weekend! ",0.6426205736028405,0.35737942639715947,0.17622456849459003,1211,4.7762180016515279,675,5.9703703703703708,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Music"

If you want to watch movies and play games, you buy a tablet. That's been the conventional wisdom for years now, except it's not really true. Especially not today.    The MacBook and iPad Pro look pretty similar on paper The line between laptops and tablets has been blurred in the PC world for a while now — that's one thing to thank Windows 8 for — but today Apple blurred that line within its own ecosystem. On the low end of things, it has the iPad mini and Air; on the high end, it has the MacBook Pro. Then there's the middle, where Apple has two slim and portable devices without a lot of traditional power: the MacBook and the newly announced iPad Pro.   More than any other iPad, the iPad Pro is being positioned as a creation device. A device for getting stuff done, for making music, for editing a spreadsheet. That's why during its presentation today, Apple didn't spend time highlighting the amazing games that could fill up its huge, high-res screen — it focused on the productivity apps you'll be using, like Office and Photoshop. The question isn't so much ""what are they for?"" as it is ""who are they for?""    That is, essentially, the description of what you'd do with the MacBook. It's a device for browsing the web, getting work done, and bringing wherever you go. It's not a great choice for opening three dozen Chrome tabs at once or editing video in Premiere — that’s where the MacBook Pro, iMac, or Mac Pro come into play — but you can write a Word document or tweak a photo in Lightroom.   When you look at both devices’ specs, the difference blurs even more: they use low-power processors, they offer about 10 hours of battery life, and they have 12(ish)-inch displays. The only differences? The iPad has a touchscreen, and you need to buy a keyboard separately. If you do that, their prices end up pretty comparable, too: buy the 128GB iPad and keyboard case, and you pay $1,248 — buy a 256GB MacBook and you pay $1,299. On paper, they’re in many ways the same product, just built very differently.     Rather than the iPad Pro and the MacBook being meant for different tasks, it's worth considering that they may just be meant for different people. The touchscreen is taking over, and for a lot of people it's a simpler and more intuitive way of using a computer. iOS is designed from the ground up for use with a touchscreen — even if OS X grafts on touch controls, it'll never be an operating system meant for people who grew up on touch screens or have grown to prefer them. Just look at Windows 10, which has had to pull back from Windows 8’s all-in approach on touch. It's managed to improve touch control of Windows in a big way, but there’s no hiding that it’s a desktop operating system, designed from day one (nearly 30 years ago) for use with a mouse.   In that sense, the iPad Pro may not be a play for today's productivity market, but the productivity market that develops in the years to come. It's very possible that hybrid devices like the iPad Pro could come to replace the typical laptop. Already, some businesses seem to be adopting them on the grounds of portability and ease of use — Apple is even working with IBM to develop specialized software and services for professionals to work with. And if younger generations prefer the touchscreen to the trackpad, the iPad Pro could eventually become their main computer. There's still a big gap between idea and reality    For now, you can't ignore the realities that separate iPad Pro and MacBook. Most people using a computer today are going to get more done with a traditional keyboard and trackpad. Most people are going to have an easier time when they can command+tab between half a dozen apps, see as many programs on screen as they want, and have the ability to customize how their computer works, even with something as simple as setting a default email app. It's obviously too soon to make a judgement on the iPad Pro — I've never even touched one! — but it's not going to be as capable as a traditional laptop. At least, not yet.   We already have a basic sense of this thanks to the iPad Air. Many a thought piece has been written on its capabilities as a creation tool and ability to replace the laptop, but it's pretty obvious that hasn't happened for most people. The Air runs these same apps and can be paired with a keyboard case. The big difference here? The iPad Pro is bigger. It’s more powerful. It has a better keyboard. And iOS 9 is going to make it capable of true multitasking. You can write it off as just being a bigger iPad, but the iPad suddenly looks a whole lot more like a laptop.   Microsoft has been playing with this space for years now It’s worth looking to Microsoft’s Surface line, where this question has already been in play for three years. The Surface Pro is the same kind of hybrid device, partway between laptop and tablet, and it’s been finding success. Microsoft doesn’t provide hard numbers, but its Surface business is growing quarter after quarter, with it bringing in $888 million last quarter. There are some big differences — the Surface Pro is much closer to a laptop in power, and it runs desktop Windows — but it’s still evidence that people are finding a role for hybrid computers.   So who is the iPad Pro for? It's for you, the person who really wants one, the person who doesn't want to use a laptop anymore or finds a touchscreen way easier. Right now, it'll probably take someone who's a bit more committed to going all in — iOS has its limitations, and you'll want to know how to get around them — but Apple seems to be setting the iPad Pro up as a tablet that could one day replace your laptop (yes, that's the Surface's slogan). My guess is that day isn't here yet for most people, but Apple just took its first real step toward it.",0.5269546274495642,0.47304537255043577,0.0930275945166928,1087,4.4185832566697334,489,5.6482617586912065,0,2,"Apple, Apple iPhone 6s announcement, Tech"

The answer is equivocal, as it neither derides nor entirely welcomes the Apple Pencil: Every Pencil needs Paper. We’re excited to launch the all-new Paper on iPhone and iPad tomorrow, after which creative thinkers everywhere will see their phones and their ideas in a new light. We believe pen-and-touch input is the foundation for a new type of productivity geared towards creative thinking. Our and Apple’s products open up these tools to even more people, which we support. We at FiftyThree are excited to reveal where we think the next chapter of productivity is headed. There will be a well-timed response from FiftyThree, which already announced plans to make its debut on the iPhone this Thursday. The company will naturally support Apple's Stylus with its software — and Apple is reciprocating by featuring FiftyThree's Paper on its iPad Pro pages — but it will also endeavor to establish a foothold for itself on the iPhone. That effort is accompanied by a $10 discount on the FiftyThree Pencil at present, which means it now starts at $39.95 — significantly cheaper than Apple's $99 accessory.

On the surface, it was because it played into the stereotype that Apple lays claim to everyday inspirations. But on a deeper level it traces back to former CEO Steve Jobs, who famously said in 2007 at the initial iPhone reveal, ""Who wants a stylus? You have to get em', put em' away. You lose them. Yuck."" Yet it turns out that eight years later, some people do want a stylus — and they've improved substantially alongside the devices with which they're used. Still, the online snark was immediate. ""Apple just announced a product that Steve Jobs famously hated,"" wrote Business Insider. ABC compiled the internet's best reactions to the product reveal including a rather clever stab from Grand Slam supplier Denny's, which announced its ""Toothpick"" product alongside the tagline, ""your teeth, performing at full potential.""   What's missing from the reactions is the obvious acknowledgment that Jobs was not only talking about using a stylus with an entirely different product — the 3.5-inch iPhone 1 — but he was referring to both styluses and screens that have been blown out of the water by newer technology. That first iPhone was one of the first smartphones to use a capacitive touchscreen, and arguably popularized them. It was the first time many people had seen multitouch gestures like pinch-to-zoom, and capacitive touch allowed Apple to use high-quality layers of glass to increase touch sensitivity and bump up the brightness and clarity of the display. It was a huge improvement over so-called resistive touchscreens found in earlier smartphones. The proliferation of capacitive tech in the years that followed helped kill off personal data assistants, relegate the old-school BlackBerry to niche markets, and usher in a consistent set of interactions across basically all mobile platforms. Capacitive touchscreens changed the game The resistive-capacitive divide gets to the types of styluses Jobs was talking about when he summed them up with ""yuck."" Styluses prior to the adoption of capacitive touch were meant to make up for the rudimentary capabilities of resistive touchscreens. You couldn't use your finger well enough on a Palm Treo 700p back in 2006 because its screen was garbage. The stylus was meant to help you maneuver quickly through the interface, whereupon you would use the physical keyboard to bang out an email. Eight years later, these types of styluses are more commonly found attached to the bottom of Nintendo's 3DS.   Apple knows that capacitive allows for better finger input; it's why Jobs tossed the idea of a stylus for the iPhone to the wayside in the first place. But the iPad Pro, for which the $99 Pencil stylus was designed, is not a small rectangle that fits in our pockets. It's a 12.9-inch sheet of glass designed to be used in many different ways, from playing games and watching movies to writing documents and taking notes with the attachable keyboard. And then there's drawing: Steve Jobs didn't envision the iPhone 1 being a viable tool for graphic designers and illustrators, people who've long used pro-grade products from companies like Wacom. But now, the Pencil is an option for those who want to use the iPad Pro as if it were a sheet a paper and the stylus as if it were — wait for it — a real pencil. Apple has designed the pen so that it has little to no latency. It can draw thicker lines with applied pressure and orient its toolset to whether you're tilting the pen, for shading, or dragging it along the surface to draw lines or form letters. These selling points make it clear that the Pencil is not designed to help you clean out your inbox. Pencil's selling points make it clear: This is not for email Still, Apple will always face accusations of playing catch-up. After all, Samsung has repopularized the stylus with its ultra-large Galaxy Note smartphone line for years, while Microsoft has been adamant about including a pen with its Surface line of 2-in-1 devices. In fact, it was Samsung's insistence on larger phone screens, and the public's desire for those screens, that led Apple to release the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus last year. The truth is that Apple has long been known to sit on obvious market trends — larger phones, smaller tablets, smartwatches, and super-large tablets — until the moment feels right to capitalize on them. The same appears true for a laptop-sized tablet that would require a $99 stylus, but only if you want it and feel like you really need it. If not, you can use your fingers. It's what Steve Jobs would have wanted.

And if you want one, Apple would like you to think that it's business as usual. You can preorder them starting September 12th, and they'll be available on September 25th. The 16GB iPhone 6S starts at $199 on-contract, and 64GB and 128GB versions will be available for $299 and $399, respectively. The 5.5-inch iPhone 6S Plus is priced slightly higher at $299, and it too is available in 64GB and 128GB options ($399 and $499, respectively). Easy. These days, buying a phone requires some math But these prices aren't quite as meaningful as they have been in years past, because major carriers have trended away from traditional two-year contracts and toward 24-month payment plans. This way, instead of paying a large chunk of the cost of the phone up front when you sign a new contract, companies like AT&T and Verizon spread that cost over the life of your plan. So today, Apple announced its own version of this: the iPhone Upgrade Program. Up front, Apple tells you four things about its new Upgrade Program. First, you'll be able to get a new iPhone every year. Second, the phone is unlocked — you can choose which carrier you'd like to use. Third is that you'll be able to pay for the phone with ""low monthly payments,"" instead of paying the subsidized cost of the phone up front. And fourth is that the Upgrade Program comes with AppleCare+. Read next: The iPhone 6S review. That sounds like a decent deal, especially with the inclusion of AppleCare+. But is it really? Let's break it down piece by piece, and see how it stacks up against the major carriers, using the base iPhone 6S and all the 24-month plans as our reference.     The iPhone Upgrade Program is basically just a 24-month installment agreement, much like the ones being offered by the four major US carriers. Once you've paid 12 monthly installments as part of that agreement, you'll be able to swap your phone for a new one. Just remember — this essentially resets the clock on the 24 months, meaning that you're now starting another two-year agreement. What Apple hasn't shared yet is information on whether (or how) you can opt out of that agreement. The major carriers typically offer you the option of paying the remaining balance of the value of the phone if you want out of their agreements early, and each has its own structure for when you can upgrade. AT&T will let you upgrade your phone after 18 months, Sprint will let you upgrade ""whenever the latest iPhone is released,"" and T-Mobile will let you upgrade after 12 months. (T-Mobile also offers a program called Jump on Demand that lets you upgrade three times per year, but we're talking iPhones here — and only one gets released every year.) Verizon's payment plan is the worst here — you can only upgrade your phone when the 24-month installment plan has been paid off in full.   Apple will sell you an unlocked phone as part of the Upgrade Program, which means you can take it to any of the four major carriers for the service of your choosing. You shouldn't have a problem bringing the phone to any of the carriers for activation, and it means you can jump from one to another if need be. Buy a phone through the carriers, however, and you'll obviously lose this luxury. Carriers tend not to sell unlocked phones (Verizon is the exception here), and when they do, the installment plans they offer are most certainly not applicable.              This is the meat of Apple's new program, and where its value truly comes from. A 16GB iPhone 6S will cost you $32.41 per month, according to Apple, and prices scale up accordingly with bigger storage options as well as the iPhone 6S Plus. This includes the $129 cost of AppleCare+, which gives you a two-year warranty and allows for two full replacements of the phone if you accidentally damage it (at $100 per replacement, of course). The installment plan is financed by a loan from Citizens Bank, which means — like with the carriers' payment plans — you'll likely have to pass a credit check before you get your phone. You also have to schedule an appointment to buy your iPhone in-store — you can't buy into the iPhone Upgrade Program without getting off your couch. You can't buy into the iPhone Upgrade Program without getting off your couch Now, the carriers all advertise monthly payments lower than what Apple tells you up front for the 16GB iPhone 6S. Verizon's 24-month payment program and AT&T's ""Next 18"" 24-month plan each cost $27.09 per month. T-Mobile’s standard 24-month program costs $27.08 per month, while its ""Jump on Demand"" option, which lets you upgrade up to three times per year, costs $27.00 per month. And Sprint's ""iPhone Forever"" program is quoted at $22.00 per month. But these prices don't include insurance. When that gets added in, each of the carriers' payment plans — except for Sprint's — winds up being $2 or more a month than Apple's.   Part of the attraction of the new iPhone Upgrade Program is that it includes the AppleCare+ insurance, which — outside of the program — costs $129 for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. AppleCare+ extends your hardware warranty to two full years, but the value really comes from accidental damage coverage, and it's worth noting that the cost of this has gone up as well. The AppleCare+ coverage still allows for two instances of accidental damage, but the replacement fee is $99. That's still better than paying the full cost of a new screen or an entirely new device if you drop (or bend) your phone, but it's not necessarily cheap. Carriers offer an array of insurance options, but even the lowest tiers all bump the monthly price of the installment plans up over the price of Apple's new plan. Buying that insurance will not only allow you to replace your phone if it's damaged, like Apple, but also if it's stolen or lost. You pay a lot more for this, though — the deductibles are usually $175 or $200, much higher than Apple's $99 replacement fee. Apple's plan is cheaper than the comparable option offered by almost every major carrier, and you get an unlocked phone to boot. AppleCare+ won't cover your phone if it gets lost or is stolen, you won't pay as much to replace your phone when you inevitably drop it. If you're not concerned with insurance at all, it's probably worth your time to parse the payment plans from the carrier of your choice. But if you want the new iPhone, some sort of insurance, and don't want to sign a traditional two-year contract, Apple's new iPhone Upgrade Program looks like the best option around.

Our senses are constantly bombarded by smells, colors, tastes, and sounds, which means that much of that information has to be filtered out, so we can focus on the stuff that matters — like the stuff that can keep us alive. But humans aren't the only animals who need to focus on certain cues to stay alive, so what, if anything, sets us apart? As it turns out, when humans and macaques focus on the same task, more regions of the human brain are active, a small study published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows. The finding reveals that the human attention network probably expanded over time. And that's a pretty important piece of our evolutionary puzzle — especially given how often scientists use the macaque brain as a proxy for our own. ""This really points to how unique the human brain is."" ""We were surprised by how different the macaque attention system ended up being in some very fundamental ways,"" says Gaurav Patel, a neuroscientist at Columbia University and a co-author of the study. ""This really points to how unique the human brain is."" In the study, researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, to observe brain activity in eight humans and two macaques during a visual attention test. The test worked like this: first, the humans and the monkeys had to memorize a piece of clip art, like a green car, for instance. Then, they were told to fixate on a point in the center of a computer screen (the monkeys received some additional training for this part). As the monkeys and the humans starred at the point, a stream of images popped up in various parts of the screen at a rate of roughly 10 objects per second. The goal was to push a button whenever they saw the green car appear.   Pictured are	   the	   increases	   (orange-­yellow)	   and	   decreases	   (blue)	   of	   neural	   activity	   in	   the	   human brain. Credit: Gaurav	   Patel/Columbia University Medical Center The fMRI data captured during the test showed that the temporoparietal junction — a region of the human brain that plays a key role in redirecting attention — doesn't have an equivalent in the macaque brain. ""We didn't see any activity in the temporoparietal junction in the macaques,"" Patel says. The researchers also found that some brain areas were more active in humans than in macaques during the attention task. Finally, there was more communication between the two brain hemispheres in humans compared with the macaques — a finding that Patel says was very surprising. Reaction speed might be more important for macaques The increased communication doesn't necessarily mean that the way the human brain operates is better, however. Sharing information with other parts of the brain may slow down certain processes in humans, Patel says. If that's the case, it's probably a sign that being able to react quickly to a predator's approach, for instance, matters more for macaques. Humans, on the other hand, may have ""traded speed for some kind of cognitive flexibility,"" Patel says. But these differences point to a larger message: humans seem to have developed an additional attention control network over evolutionary time, Patel says. This isn't entirely surprising. The last common ancestor between humans and macaques lived about 25 million years ago, so one would expect to see some pretty large differences appear after that split. But contrasting both brains as they perform the same tasks is a good way of piecing together the evolutionary pressures that lead to these differences. ""Humans are much more complex in the way they interact socially, so they need a greater ability — or a better ability — to pick up on those subtle cues and use that information to guide their future decisions than a macaque would,"" Patel says. It's therefore possible that this additional network is used to detect behavioral information that macaques don't need. The study didn't look at social behaviors, however, so that idea is just speculation for now. ""​The most exciting [finding], I think, is the fact that there is a clear sign that the human brain has some unique properties"" that separate it from other monkeys and primates, Patel says. (Although he admits that the differences between humans and certain other species might not be as large.)  ""The macaque is an excellent model for attention research."" The study is ""very elegant,"" says Sabine Kastner, an attention researcher at Princeton University who didn't work on the study. But the findings can't really be used to discredit the use of the macaque brain model, she says. ""There is a wealth of evidence that the macaque is an excellent model for attention research in general."" Robert Desimone, a neuroscientist at MIT, agrees. A lot of studies suggest that there are numerous similarities across both species, he says. Desimone also points out that fMRI data are limited because they're based on oxygen levels in the blood, instead of actual neural activity. This means that the data aren't very detailed; they're an indirect measure of the activity of a very large number of neurons, says Detlef Wegener, a neuroscientist at the University of Bremen in Germany who didn't work on this study. Still, the work does hint that the human attention networks are characterized by particularities that ""can't be fully deduced from monkey data,"" Wegener says. Some human particularities ""can't be fully deduced from monkey data."" For Patel, the study shows that there are some aspects of human cognition that ""we'll just have to study in humans,"" instead of monkeys. He also hopes that this work will push scientists to try to understand more about the macaque brain and how it's adapted to its environment. Focusing on the macaque brain could reveal a lot about ""what the human brain has done to adapt to its own environment"" during the past 25 million years, he says.",0.6239345212340799,0.3760654787659201,0.26783164511855345,1031,4.8506304558680888,470,6.048936170212766,0,2,"Science, Report"

The movie Predestination, released in the UK this February, is the very latest in the long history of time travel films. There's been more than 100 since the Terminator and Back to the Future franchises began 30 years ago — all of which are science fiction that have little to do with science facts. Like many of them, Predestination has its own engaging twist: Ethan Hawke plays a time agent who nips back through history to snuff out crimes before they can be committed. Like all of them it's chronologically illogical: the split second a movie has someone monkeying with time you are doomed — predestined, you might say — to abandon the science and enter a plea of temporal insanity. Things very quickly get very brain boggling. Consider this — if someone builds a time machine, what's to prevent them going back one minute and smashing it up before they first use it? Which means it never gets used — so how did it get smashed up? What prevents the whole parade of paradoxes thrown up by time travel to the past — becoming your own grandfather, killing Hitler before he starts World War II and so on — is that they trash big laws of physics. And the Universe, as far as we understand it, likes to play by the rules.  If someone builds a time machine what's to prevent them going back one minute and smashing it up before they first use it? One of the fundamentals that underpins not just physics but every aspect of existence is the law of cause and effect, always in that order. Changing the past would violate that: your actions would affect what caused you to go back in the first place — so if you did manage to kill Hitler he wouldn't have done what led you to go back and kill him. That doesn't stop filmmakers from exploring the consequences if you could somehow drop in on history. For Hollywood, applause and special effects are more important than cause and effect, and time travel offers unlimited opportunities to push both imagination and CGI to their limits. Hence screen time machines have included a police box (Dr Who), a phone booth (Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure), a DeLorean sports car (Back to the Future) and a big nudes-only energy ball (Terminator). Unlike other favorite science fiction themes such as smarter-than-human robots or interstellar travel or encounters with aliens — all of which are somewhere on a scale of theoretically possible to eventually probable — time travel to the past is now and forever a complete scientific no-no. Well, almost complete. There is a loophole. A tiny loophole called a wormhole. Stephen Hawking is one of many respected scientists who now believe that our entire Universe is permeated by wormholes, effectively shortcuts through time and space. While entirely compatible with Einstein's theory of relativity and most other current big ideas about the nature of reality, they open up the possibility not only of journeys in time — popping in one end of a wormhole and popping out days, years or centuries earlier — but also of instantly linking distant parts of the cosmos, effectively enabling faster-than-light travel. No wonder the idea of wormholes is so often borrowed by a whole slew of so-called sci-fi (including Star Trek, Stargate, The Avengers and Interstellar). There is a loophole. A tiny loophole called a wormhole Just one word of warning before anyone attempts to build a spaceship and steer for the nearest wormhole: they may be real, they may be common and they may bridge time and space, but having a wormhole is one thing, having one you can use is quite another. Even Professor Hawking, who admits to being ""obsessed by time"" and to wanting to believe time travel is possible, points out that wormholes are only thought to exist in the ""quantum foam"" right down below even the scale of atoms. That's way too small to squeeze a spaceship through. Or Arnold Schwarzenegger. Or even Michael J. Fox. There are those who argue that given enough technology, theoretical physicists, and, er, time, we might eventually develop a way to snare some of these infinitesimally tiny wormholes and then make them billions of times bigger so we could go where and when we wanted. It's all colossally speculative at the moment, but just supposing such a traversable wormhole were someday constructed, and you carefully avoided all deliberate interference with the past, you would still run smack into another prohibitive paradox. It's one nicely illustrated by Ray Bradbury's classic early '50s short story A Sound of Thunder, where time travelers to Earth's prehistoric past are kept on a levitating walkway to minimize their chance of any contact with the past. Someone falls off and accidentally crushes a single butterfly. When they return to their present, all sorts of things, from spellings of words to the outcome of elections, are different, and they have created an alternative reality. Bradbury's story is the first incarnation of the ""Butterfly Effect"" often evoked in chaos theory: the idea that one tiny change now can result in all manner of large and often unforeseeable changes later. And that's a real obstacle for going back in time. If anyone could overcome the enormous challenge of how to do it, they would still face the equally great challenge of how to do it without risk of affecting the past in the slightest. Alter one thing, and you could alter everything and end up rewriting reality. Again, there are some who are bending their minds to ways round these restrictions: there are all sorts of theories involving configurations of multiple wormholes and ‘closed timelike curves' and other elaborate alternatives. But sadly for those who like their film fantasies grounded in reality there could be one simple reason why all these problems and paradoxes appear insurmountable: they just are. Much as we love the idea of changing the past and erasing our mistakes — I've some deep regrets about a coat I bought in 2007 — it seems nothing, including wormholes, can take us back there. Traveling into the future, however, is not necessarily impossible. In fact, there are those who have already done it. The greatest of them is Sergei Krikalev, a cosmonaut now also a chrononaut by virtue of having spent so long in space that it's been calculated he's traveled into his own future by about one-two hundredths of a second. Traveling into the future, however, is not necessarily impossible. In fact, there are those who have already done it Okay, it's not much. But it's still enough to be tricky to get your head round. It's all down to time dilation, something predicted by Einstein's Theory of Relativity but which we can measure, whereby the faster someone goes (and Sergei spent over two years in orbit on Mir and the International Space Station traveling at over 17,000mph) the slower their clock goes relative to those back down on Earth. It's more complicated than this because gravity is also involved, but Sergei has aged fractionally less than he would have if he'd not gone into space. Start cranking up the velocity and the effects become much more pronounced: if chrononaut Krikalev had spent his two years in space traveling at a smidge below the speed of light (almost 40,000 times faster than he was orbiting at) he would have returned to find two centuries or more had passed on Earth. That's proper time travel. Of course it might be unfeasible to ever get up to such speeds and the trips are strictly one way, but unlike plunging into history we at least know it is possible. So while films about going back in time are pure fantasy, ones where people end up in the future have a smidge of science amongst the fiction. Which makes it a pity there are so few of them. The two versions of HG Wells' The Time Machine, the Back to the Future trilogy, and Planet of the Apes are among the few that at least involve some travel into the future. The only film I'm aware of to attempt to portray the realities of time travel is last year's Interstellar. It draws on time dilation and the ""Rip Van Winkle"" experience for returning astronauts of finding themselves decades out of phase with the people they left behind. Perhaps it's the start of a move toward factual accuracy in time travel films. But I doubt it. Is it too much to wish for more movies that don't take it so seriously, and have fun with the ludicrousness of leaping around in history? Films like Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure with its paradox-popping ending. Now there's a film I can watch time and time again. This article was first published on BBC Future.

Onboard instruments will capture the most detailed images of Pluto ever seen, but nestled next to these tools are some more unusual items of cargo — including a portion of the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh, the American astronomer who discovered Pluto.  Tombaugh, who died in 1997, has a pretty remarkable story, as this NASA interview with his children Annette and Alden reveals. He started life as farmer, making his own telescopes from scraps of agricultural equipment, and in his early 20s he got in touch with the Lowell Observatory to get some feedback on his work. ""He wanted them to give him suggestions to build better telescopes and so he sent them some of his drawings of Mars and Jupiter,"" said Annette Tombaugh. ""They wrote back that they would like to hire him."" Tombaugh's work at the observatory eventually led to his discovery of Pluto in 1930 as well as hundreds of other asteroids. A small container holding some of Tombaugh's ashes are fixed to the inside upper deck of New Horizons, bearing the inscription: ""Interned herein are remains of American Clyde W. Tombaugh, discoverer of Pluto and the solar system's ‘third zone,' Adelle and Muron's boy, Patricia's husband, Annette and Alden's father, astronomer, teacher, punster, and friend: Clyde W. Tombaugh (1906-1997)."" Some of the other mementos onboard the probe include a CD with images of staff who worked on the project, a small piece of SpaceShipOne (the craft that completed the first manned private spaceflight in 2004), a pair of state quarters from Florida and Maryland (where the probe was launched and built respectively), and a 1991 US stamp of the dwarf planet bearing the motto: ""Pluto: Not Yet Explored."" ""I think my dad would be thrilled with the New Horizons, I mean who wouldn’t be?"" Annette Tombaugh told NASA. ""When he looked at Pluto it was just a speck of light...

Over the course of the episode, they’re confronted with often skeptical and occasionally hostile commentary from the press, until Masters is finally inspired to give a stirring speech about the damaging effects of stigma and ignorance around sexuality. In response, one of the most antagonistic members of the press reveals that he’s only been hard on the pair because he believes their research is incredibly important — on par, he suggests, with that of Galileo. It might be tempting to read this as a historical drama portraying a pivotal real-life moment in sex research; that from here on out, Masters and Johnson (and those who followed in their footsteps) found themselves welcomed with open arms, with sex research finally treated as a legitimate scientific field. But — as the season three will doubtless reveal — while the field continues to make positive strides toward mainstream acceptance, there are still a number of barriers and hurdles faced by academics interested in exploring the dynamics of sex, even in the present day. We may be a long way from the '60s, when this sort of research was completely unheard of, but scientists who study sex still find themselves coming up against a number of barriers. Few individuals are willing to put their money behind sex-related research Would-be sexologists have a great deal more avenues and opportunities than Masters and Johnson had: in the US alone, there are numerous institutions offering advanced degrees in the study of sex. But while it’s now easier to find a degree program to house your research, when it comes to finding funding for their research, the options are a bit more limited. ""I don’t apply for federal funding for most of the work that I do,"" says Dr. Debby Herbenick, a sexual health educator at the Kinsey Institute. ""There’s very little available for sexuality topics. I don’t put myself into that position very often where I feel I need to be on governmental funding."" Private foundations can also be a hard sell: as Dr. Miro Gudelsky, a sex therapist who received her doctorate in Human Sexuality from the Institute For the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality, explains, few individuals are willing to put their money, or their family’s money, behind sex-related research. ""Grandpa worked really hard so that we can find out the most sensitive part of the penis"" generally isn’t the sort of story family foundations want to tell. Which is not to say that there’s no funding for sex-related research. Most of Herbenick’s work is funded by corporations that create products that benefit from her research on sexual behavior, safer sex, and pleasure — for instance, condom and sex toy manufacturers. But this avenue isn’t open to everyone. Herbenick’s work is a natural fit for this sort of partnership, but some of her peers — particularly those interested investigating more controversial or taboo aspects of sexuality — find themselves far less fortunate. Researchers who hope to delve into areas like pedophilia have a very difficult time finding financial support for their work; even those who merely want to study normal adolescent sexual development find that funding is rather scarce. Studies that focus on risks associated with teen sexuality (like adolescent pregnancy) are more successful, but anything daring to examine the more pleasure-focused aspects tend to be out of the realm of interest for funding sources. Even researchers who, with adequate funding and support, may find that they’re not always taken very seriously because of the stigma still attached to sexuality. ""You’re doing actual research... and people just see it as ‘Oh, it’s sex, how titillating,’"" comments Gudelsky. And, unlike colleagues in other fields, sex researchers are often forced to contend with assumptions that their professional interests reflect their personal habits. Few assume that ornithologists harbor a secret wish to be birds, or that medical researchers are drawn to their field due to a history of illness, but sex therapists and researchers are frequently presumed to be incredibly adventurous in the bedroom, merely due to their field of research. And the effects of this stigma aren’t merely limited to those studying the act of sex itself: they can also impact the work of researchers looking to study populations who are publicly affiliated with sexuality. As a master's student at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, Tara Burns set out to study the human rights impacts of Alaska's prostitution and sex trafficking policy, but from the outset, she found herself facing some unique impediments. Finding committee members to support her research proved incredibly challenging: several department members automatically assumed that the institutional review board (IRB) would never approve her project, while others argued that she’d need psychological training to embark on discussions with sex workers — despite the fact that, prior to graduate school, Burns had spent two decades working in the sex industry. Still others suggested that the work might ruin her chances at a serious academic career. Even after Burns found three incredibly supportive committee members who showed great enthusiasm for her project, she still came up against resistance. While securing approval to work with human subjects, she was informed that, due to the nature of their work, her proposed subjects were considered vulnerable. And even after she secured internal IRB approval, she was then required to secure additional, outside approval from a committee at Yale. Burns did eventually get into the field, and the importance of her work quickly became clear. Through her research, Burns discovered that Alaskan sex workers faced an elevated risk of sexual assault at the hands of police officers, and, troublingly, were often discouraged from reporting crime due to the likelihood of getting arrested in the process of filing a report. Burns later took her research to the state legislature in Juneau where, again, she faced discomfort and prejudice due to the sexual nature of her work. ""If I had been there [advocating for] some other category of people in our state that are turned away when they try to make police reports 80 percent of the time, they probably would have cared a lot more,"" she says. ""But they don’t want to be perceived as being associated with the prostitutes."" While it's easy to assume the attitudes and stigmas on display on Masters of Sex are relics of the past compared to our enlightened society, Burns’ academic experience suggests we’ve still got a long way to go. But her current work offers a possible way forward for sex researchers looking to fund their work in creative ways. Rather than pursuing federal or foundation funding for her latest project — which takes the research she did on sex work in Alaska to a national level — Burns has turned to crowdfunding. Though this strategy has yet to gain traction in academic circles, there are definitely some who see its promise. ""It’s going to push the research in such amazing directions, because now you don’t have to rely on university money or big corporations,"" says Gudelsky. And if it does manage to provide new sources of funding to research that’s often overlooked by the government, foundations, and even corporations — well, it could be as transformative for sex research as the work of Masters and Johnson.

Like the Higgs boson before it, the pentaquark's existence has been theorized for years, but experiments in the early-2000s claiming to have detected the exotic form of matter were later invalidated. Many scientists had since given up on the pentaquark for good, but this time, say CERN physicists, there's no doubt it's been found. As its name suggests, the pentaquark is a particle consisting of five quarks bound together. Quarks are elementary particles that exist in six variations known as flavors (these are given the unusual names of up, down, strange, charm, top, and bottom). These bind together in different combinations to form a range of composite particles, of which the most commonly known are neutrons and protons, consisting of three quarks each. ""The pentaquark... has never been observed before in over 50 years of experimental searches."" ""The pentaquark is not just any new particle,"" said Guy Wilkinson, a spokesperson for the LHCb, one of the LHC's seven particle detectors and the site of the pentaquark's discovery. ""It represents a way to aggregate quarks... in a pattern that has never been observed before in over 50 years of experimental searches. Studying its properties may allow us to understand better how ordinary matter, the protons and neutrons from which we’re all made, is constituted.""

The data for the resulting paper (which has been submitted for publication in the journal Physics Review Letters) was recorded between 2009 and 2012, but scientists were wary of the results given previous invalidated experiments. ""We were studying something else at the time so at first we ignored it,"" LHCb physicist Sheldon Stone told Nature. ""For historical reasons we were quite haunted by the word pentaquark, so we did every conceivable check we could."" Some scientists have suggested that there may yet be a better interpretation for the data that does not involve pentaquarks, but CERN's physicists are certain.

Red Bull just pulled a similar trick: Paul Bonhomme and Steve Jones became the first in the world to fly stunt planes through a building in formation. Bonhomme and Jones threaded the proverbial needle through an open hanger in North Wales while flying 185mph (160 knots) only a meter off the ground. Other pilots — like Jones himself and even a few amateurs — have pulled off similar feats, but it's always done solo and they typically fly under bridges, which afford much more leeway. Doing it in formation through a tiny hangar, inches away from another pilot whose nerves are similarly racked, is basically unheard of.

Shit. Press Y to rewind. Try again. With each successive (and successful) Forza Motorsport title, developer Turn 10 wades slowly and deliberately through the uncanny valley of car simulation. The new Forza 6 is no exception; creative director Bill Giese walked us through some of nuance of the new weather and night modes just before we got a chance to check it out ourselves at Microsoft's E3 2015 booth.  Rain is the big one, both visually and in terms of how you play. At moments it looked like individual drops were falling on the spoiler. Hydroplaning is now a real concern. Most, but not all, of Forza 6's iconic tracks will support rain; Giese said some tracks like Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina would not have rain as an option because it doesn't rain very often in the desert. ""We wanted to recreate specific race events,"" he added. It isn't the first racing title with impressive rain (hello there, Drive Club or even the latest Forza Horizon spinoff), but it's still a welcome addition here. Nighttime is the other major new environmental feature, and for that, we drove a (virtual) Lamborghini Huracán. It is seriously dark, save for a few fireworks, the glow from our dashboard electronics, and the lights from other cars. Get too far ahead — or in my case, too far behind — and it feels like driving in the middle of nowhere at midnight. Giese noted, too, that because of cooler nighttime temperatures, your car will grip the road less (not something I noticed, but I didn't get a chance to play the same track in the daytime).

Prior to an April conference call with Google, the DMV had been totally unaware of eight incidents involving Google's fleet that occured between 2010 and July 2014. State law mandates that accidents totaling $750 or more in property damage be reported to the agency. It's very possible Google's cars suffered less damage than that. By all accounts, these were nothing more than terribly minor fender benders. But the company told the AP that since repairs were completed in-house, it's unable to put an estimate on those damages.

Perhaps not on the surface, which is strewn with green fields dotted with grazing cows and picture-postcard cottages. But it plays host to a competition and a culture that are unlike those anywhere else in the world. If you live on or are visiting the Isle of Man, you are a motorcycling enthusiast, and odds are pretty good that you also like danger, speed, and the intoxicating smell of petrol.  The one-week Isle of Man Tourist Trophy (TT) event is regarded as the pinnacle of road racing for bike fanatics. A fast and varied course spanning most of the island provides a terrific challenge for both rider and bike, and every year — almost without exception — there are fatalities that underscore the perils of taking it on without the proper caution or training. It doesn't sound like a terribly welcoming place to be bringing experimental new technology to, but electric bikes have carved themselves a niche over the past few years and continue improving in their own category of zero-emissions racing, dubbed TT Zero. This year, I found myself on the Isle of Man following the fortunes of the rookie Victory Racing team from the USA and its pair of prototype electric bikes. Victory’s entry into the TT Zero class offered me a chance to learn about the current state of electric bike development and, along the way, discover the unique culture and global community that have built up around the Isle of Man and its iconic race series. Victory came to market as a Harley-Davidson competitor when it was launched by snowmobile maker Polaris a decade and a half ago. Lithe, high-tech race bikes are about as far from Victory’s core two-wheeled competency as possible — but then these TT machines are actually the product of multiple years of development. At the start of this year, Polaris acquired the motorcycle division of Oregon-based Brammo, whose all-electric Empulse forms the foundation for the present race bikes. Gary Gray, Victory’s product chief, tells me the company has made ""quite a few changes"" in the brief period of time it’s had to work with Brammo’s assets, including the development of improved, structurally reinforced battery packs, new motor windings for better performance, and a reinforced frame to deal with the loads and strains of the rough TT track. Each bike weighs roughly 220kg (485lb) — not far off from the typical 200kg dry weight of a gas-powered bike — and is designed to have just enough energy to complete the single-lap race and no more. The perfect run for one of these electric bikes will see it crossing the finish line with zero charge left. ""Our number one priority is safety,"" says a serious-looking Gray as he surveys his team of engineers making final preparations before the bikes’ first practice run. Each battery is fine-tuned so that it discharges at the same rate and small adjustments are made to the scant padding to tailor the bikes to the particular rider’s preferences. Gray isn’t alone in feeling trepidation about the 37-mile course ahead, which runs through towns, villages, and a treacherous mountain section that claims the lives of professional competitors and amateur bikers each and every year. For a company looking to make its racing debut, Victory is showing great confidence by heading straight into the scariest and most challenging road race on the planet. In any other category, Victory’s inexperience would mark it out as a major underdog, however that’s not the case in the still-fledgling TT Zero class. There are only seven teams competing in the electric race, and three of them are composed of volunteers from UK universities — researchers who are combining their academic work with a passion for speed. Each battery-powered bike is built and engineered specifically for the TT and Victory is one of only three teams that were able to bring two electric vehicles to the Isle of Man, resulting in a total of 10 riders for the entire race. Compare that to the 71 competitors in the Sidecar race or the 91 in the Superbike class. Such a ragtag group of mostly amateur teams doesn’t immediately inspire great faith in the popularity and growth of electric racing, but it belies a recent history of superbly fast innovation and improvement. At the top of the electric heap is Team Mugen, a Japanese outfit that’s entering its fourth TT Zero contest and is returning as the reigning champion. Best known as Honda’s semi-official performance tuner, Mugen is the brainchild of Hirotoshi Honda, the son of Honda founder Soichiro. It’s an independent company doing its own thing, though the motivation of its owner seems innately tied to the legacy of his father. Honda bikes have a grand history of excellent performances at the Isle of Man, and Mugen is building up a similar reputation for Hirotoshi in the electric races. Now 73, the Honda scion says that his company’s involvement in the TT Zero event is purely for the advancement of technology and the education of the young — and I fully believe him, given the lack of any immediate commercial or monetary benefit to competing in the race. Participating in TT Zero is about pride, speed, science, and little else. Mugen’s progress is a perfect example of the steep trajectory of improvement in electric bikes: the company started competing in 2012 with an average speed around the TT track in the high 80s miles per hour, but by last year it was already speeding past an average of 117mph and this year set a new electric record with 119.3mph. Colin Whittamore, the UK General Manager for Mugen, puts it quite beautifully when he says ""it’s a long way to go over the course of 80 minutes."" Mugen only has four competitive races under its belt, each lasting roughly 20 minutes, and yet it’s accomplished a leap in performance that took gas-powered bikes a full 48 years to complete. The top bikes averaged 87mph in 1936 and didn’t surpass 117mph until 1984. ""The gains to be found"" with electric racing, says Whittamore, ""are huge, and quite unusual for motorsport."" To illustrate, he tells me that the original 2012 Mugen electric motor was twice as heavy as the current one and provided only 60 percent of the power. The competitive field may be small and highly specialized, but the competitive quality of the electric bikes is no longer questioned. Five of the six bikes that completed the TT Zero run averaged in excess of 106mph — an unthinkable feat only a few years ago — and Victory’s debutant bikes weren’t too far off Mugen’s impeccable pace, achieving average speeds of 111.6mph and 109.7mph each. Mugen repeated its 2014 result by grabbing the first and second spots on the podium with both its riders breaking last year’s speed record and averaging in excess of 118mph. Victory claimed third and asserted itself as a significant player for future races to come. For a first performance, in a contest where just getting a battery-powered machine to complete the course is a feat in and of itself, Victory achieved its basic goals and then some. Electric bikes are now within striking distance of the very best lap speeds around the TT track, which average just over 130mph in the hands of the most expert riders. And what’s more, those very same riders are enthusiastically embracing the new type of bike. Until recently, Bruce Anstey held the outright TT record with 132.3mph on his Honda superbike, but he also rides for Mugen in the TT Zero competition. His teammate and this year’s repeating TT Zero champion, John McGuinness took that gas-powered record from him this year with 132.7mph. McGuinness, despite some initial misgivings, is now one of the most ardent advocates of electric racing. ""I probably did snigger a little bit in the beginning,"" says McGuinness, ""watching that first race in 2009 and seeing bikes with washing machine motors and car batteries strapped to them. But they’ve come a hell of a long way since then."" Heading into this year’s Isle of Man series with 21 victories on the island, McGuinness is the most decorated living TT racer, and together with Anstey adds a great deal of credibility to the battery-powered race. But whether the mount is electric or gasoline, it’s hard to overstate just how dangerous and technical the Tourist Trophy is — even for established racers. The margin for error through some of the course’s most difficult sections is effectively zero, with even the smallest mistakes spelling disaster. William Dunlop, another established TT veteran with a spot on the top 10 speed list, was intended to lead the charge for Victory Racing before a crash in practice for the Superstock race ruled him out with a broken rib. He was replaced in the TT Zero competition by his Tyco BMW teammate Guy Martin, yet another racer with extensive TT experience, who finished fourth in the eventual race behind fellow Victory rider Lee Johnston. Johnston also picked up an injury ahead of the electric contest, but was able to carry on with a heavily bruised right shoulder and arm. Interestingly, there were no crashes or calamities on the electric bikes, with the exception of one university team blowing out its battery in practice and thus forfeiting its spot in the race. Because the electric bikes are still unproven, no one is yet willing to push them to their limits, and that caution seems to be paying off with a safer contest. John McGuinness has even said that he probably could have surpassed the 120mph mark had he gone flat-out from the very beginning, but he started the bike in the less aggressive of its two modes, again prioritizing safety over absolute speed. At the present pace of innovation, by next year Mugen is almost certain to be riding past 120mph and Victory could be approaching today’s record. 2016 should also see the return of MotoCzysz to the Isle of Man. One of the true pioneers of electric racing, team owner Michael Czysz has been battling cancer in recent years, but he’s indicated his desire to get the team that dominated battery-powered TT racing before Mugen back into the competition.   @MotoCzysz great to hear from you and would be wonderful to see you here in 2016. We miss you here and best wishes from all at Team Mugen As in the automotive industry, alternative powertrains are a long-term inevitability for the motorcycle business. Even Harley, the patron saint of two-wheeled chrome and noise, is crafting an electric strategy around its Project LiveWire. There may be no better proving ground for the technology than the 37 brutal miles of the TT course. Each team is contributing to the wider understanding of how to make electric motors more efficient, batteries more durable, and bike designs both more efficient and more durable. And none of them are doing it for any immediate profit. This is the biggest collection of friendly losers I’ve ever met, with each team committing significant investments of time and money into a race with a negligible prize fund and a track record of taking the lives of some of its biggest stars. ""One of the many reasons why you race is brand exposure,"" says Victory’s Gary Gray, ""but we’re learning a lot here about what it takes to deliver electric performance reliably."" His team isn’t selfish with those lessons, either, as I witnessed them helping engineers from the University of Nottingham’s TT Zero crew with parts and advice for putting together their bike for the upcoming race. This warmly collaborative approach may be merely a function of the wide gap in expected performance and might therefore fade away as competitiveness increases, but it’s still laudable and helps to advance research and development. If speed is the only metric by which bike racing is to be judged, then battery-powered bikes have already proven their worth. But the fans that make the hallowed pilgrimage to the Isle of Man every year don’t come just for speed. They come for the spectacle of speed. That means thundering engine noise and a haze of exhaust fumes mixing with the waft of burnt rubber. ""I think 100 percent that it’s the lack of noise that puts a lot of people off,"" says Mugen’s John McGuinness, in discussing why fan adoration hasn’t kept up with the rapid development of electric bikes. There’s an amusing dichotomy developing around battery power: the very things that the fans find off-putting and inauthentic, the lack of noise and smell, are the things that riders actually like. Victory’s Lee Johnston says he prefers the ""peaceful"" ride he gets on the electric bike, specifically calling out the roaring engine noise and gas fumes as downsides of conventional gas-powered bikes. Johnston, McGuinness, Anstey, and most of the other riders appear comfortable and ready to embrace electric bikes as another, no less reputable form of two-wheeled racing in which they can compete. Some complain about the lack of power at the very top end, saying the bikes don’t allow for the same acceleration out of a corner and that ""you’re on full throttle 80 percent of the time,"" but I’ve heard a lot more positive accounts of riding these bikes than negative ones. The rider’s job is simpler when you don’t have to be figuring out when and where to downshift, and the differences in skill become concentrated in how cleanly and efficiently each racer navigates the course. It looks to be the perfect diversifying race, offering a different test to the established bike classes. And yet, diversification seems like something the traditionalist Isle of Man audience will be reluctant to embrace. ""From a petrolhead's point of view, this is the only race left that's still pure. No safety, no bullshit."" This is the candid assessment of Miquel Gimeno-Fabra, a researcher on the University of Nottingham team, who’s quick to tell me that his views are not to be interpreted as those of his institution. He’s right, all the same. The Isle of Man attracts a peculiar class of ultra-committed fan that seeks to preserve what’s viewed as an endangered tradition of risky and thus spectacular road racing. Electric bikes might be fun to ride and all, but if they’re safe and quiet, what’s the point of running them around the TT track at all? Like skydiving or climbing Mount Everest, tells me Hirotoshi Honda, the risk is what makes things interesting. Coming to the Isle of Man is a unique experience for any sports fan. Firstly, there’s the incredible commitment exhibited by everyone around you: more than 14,000 motorcycles were ferried onto the island for this year’s TT series, all of them helmed by bikers in full racing gear. It’s not just dudes, either, as women are here in great number as well, riding their Suzukis and Kawasakis alongside male friends. One couple, David and Karen, got married at this year’s TT after coming to the show for 10 years in a row. The local Radio TT announced the happy news with the note that she was, in fact, wearing a dress at the wedding — a leather outfit might have been just as likely in this odd islandish realm. Imagine attending the Super Bowl with a majority of the spectators wearing shoulder pads and helmets and you’ll get an inkling of how alien the Isle of Man can feel. That need not mean unwelcoming, however, as I was struck by how sociable everyone was — despite looking like spacemen and indulging in an occasionally reckless pursuit of high-speed thrills, these are probably the friendliest people I’ve met at any sporting event. The TT race organizers contribute to the open atmosphere by providing an unprecedented level of access to the fans. You can stroll around the paddocks, observe the adjustments being made to each bike, and even walk up to your favorite rider and ask him for an autograph. When races are going on, the roads are closed down ahead of time, but people tend to crowd into the front yards of the houses adjoining the course and lean in to snap their own photos of the racers speeding by. It’s another risky habit on an island whose appeal seems inextricably linked to the atmosphere of ever-present danger. My time on the Isle of Man has left me with some conflicting impressions. On the one hand, the TT track is the perfect proving ground for electric bikes as a credible racing class, one that could in due time compete with even the most powerful of superbikes. On the other hand, the Isle of Man series is revered for preserving a classic road racing heritage, and fans may never fully embrace the more modern variety of bike. The washing machine jokes persist. No matter how people may feel about electric motors being part of the Isle of Man races, ultimately everyone agrees that they’ll play a hugely important role in all aspects of motor transportation. ""It's just a matter of when. Electric vehicles, cars, bikes will be the future,"" says Mugen’s Whittamore. ""We believe that electric is the future for all vehicle types,"" says Victory’s Gray. Neither of these companies has a road-going electric machine to sell — at least not yet — but both are accelerating development toward the future of which they speak with their participation in the TT Zero. The electric bike is growing up fast, and these are the people we have to thank for it.

One example is automatic braking systems, with US regulators this month announcing a preliminary investigation into the 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee, after complaints that the vehicle's automatic brakes have been triggering for no reason. In an official filing from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), investigators reported nine complaints about the SUV's automatic braking system. These covered ""multiple events at different locations and road conditions,"" and in two of the complaints the drivers noted that there were ""no objects on the road"" at all. ""Consumers allege incidents of random proximity collision alerts followed by inappropriate automatic braking with no pending threats in the line of travel,"" says the report. There are no reported crashes or injuries linked to the investigation. Honda, Fiat, GM, and Nissan have all been the subject of similar complaints This is far from the first time automatic braking systems have come under scrutiny, with the Wall Street Journal noting that Honda, Fiat Chrysler, and General Motors vehicles have all been the subject of similar complaints. Earlier this year, for example, Honda recalled just under 48,000 vehicles after the company's automatic braking system was found to be activated when cars were driving alongside a metal fence or guardrail and the vehicle in front accelerated. And in 2012, a pair of Nissan Infiniti JX35 SUVs both hit the brakes automatically in separate episodes at the same spot on the New Jersey bridge after mistaking a grate for a barrier. At the time, a spokesperson for Nissan told The New York Times that the incident was not viewed as a ""safety issue"" as even in the case of automatic brakes mistakenly activating, ""braking is controlled and the brake lamps illuminate to alert the drivers behind the vehicle."" These complaints are relatively uncommon considering that around 630,000 vehicles sold in the US this year are thought to have automatic braking systems. This number, produced by market analysts Navigant Research and reported by the WSJ, is expected to rise to 10 million by the year 2020. The NHTSA also apparently has faith in the technology, and this year added automatic braking systems to its list of recommended safety features. Car manufacturers, however, still have some fine-tuning to do.",0.48123992665818904,0.518760073341811,0.6378921738779516,397,5.3047858942065496,246,6.166666666666667,0,0,"Tech, Transportation, US & World"

The adrenaline junkie's pilgrimage destination. The pinnacle of bike road racing. It's hard to find the perfect, all-encompassing superlative to describe the intoxicating mix of prestige, danger, speed, and excitement that the Isle of Man represents. The Tourist Trophy week of racing that this small island plays host to every year is regarded with nothing short of reverence among motorcycling fans. This year, I came along for the ride to look at how a new breed of electric bikes is carving out a niche for itself in the nascent TT Zero class. Check out my favorite pictures from the trip below and make sure to also read the full report from my time on the island.  Two things that are particularly abundant on the Isle of Man: lush green scenery and motorcycles. Despite being rookies to the Isle of Man event, Victory arrived as one of the favorites to do well, thanks to a mature bike design from Brammo. Final preparations for the bikes ahead of practice include adjusting padding to suit each rider and fine-tuning the batteries so that power is drawn at the same rate from each of them. One of the optional components on the Victory bike is a GoPro camera to stare back at the rider as he speeds his way around the island. A standard feature on these electric bikes is an emergency kill switch at the rear. Before every practice lap, race officials inspect each bike to ensure it adheres to regulations and is safe to ride. Finishing third behind the duo of Team Mugen bikes, Lee Johnston set a time of 20 minutes and 17 seconds around the 37-mile TT course, averaging 111mph. Here he's showing the effects of an earlier crash he sustained while practicing for the conventional petrol-powered races. Johnston's helmet features his charity fundraising effort, titled F13K CANCER, which contributes to the Marie Curie organization. Lee Johnston embracing a friend before saddling up. Stepping into the place of the injured William Dunlop, Guy Martin rode the second Victory Racing bike to a time of 20 minutes and 38 seconds, good for an average speed of nearly 110mph. The race course offers beautiful views and long undulating bends that can be taken at high speed. There are a number of long straights that let riders reach speeds in excess of 200mph. Built-up areas are also part of the course. When the race isn't on, fans get to recreate the experience for themselves on the same roads, albeit with some limitations. These seats are only a few feet away from the race course itself, providing a very intimate (and potentially dangerous) experience for the fans. Camping is the primary way that visitors to the Isle of Man accommodate themselves on the island. The tents across the green fields are almost as numerous as the bikes on the roads. Mugen took the top two spots in the TT Zero race. Here you see Bruce Anstey's second-place bike in the foreground and John McGuinness' victorious ride at the back. Immediately after the race, the bikes are plugged into Mugen's computers and the post-race analysis begins. Standing in the middle of this shot is Hirotoshi Honda, founder of Mugen Power. McGuinness' winning bike has proven quite an attraction for both fans and competitors to check out. Winning the TT Zero gets you a wreath, a hat, and a place in history, though not much in the way of prize money. The Isle of Man was used by companies like Kawasaki to showcase their latest technology and bikes, whether they were competing in the races or not. Lee Johnston, who finished third for Victory Racing, poses alongside TT Zero winner John McGuinness, Mugen team owner Hirotoshi Honda, and second-place finisher Bruce Anstey. Every street on the Isle of Man is littered with the bikes of fans, who come for the week's racing in their full racing outfits and even ferry their rides over. The Isle of Man TT helicopter punctuates an otherwise spotless sky. The area around the race has been declared a no-fly zone this year, and the use of drones has been expressly forbidden. Fans can get incredibly close to the action. Michael Sweeney, riding for the University of Nottingham, gives feedback to his team following a successful practice lap. Each bike in the electric race is a prototype, which means you get to see exposed electronics and pieces of duct tape holding a few things together.

It's not just the pretentious yet bland reference to the Young Male Writer's favorite inspiration right in the name. It's not just the exhortation to use its long battery life and ""pull a Thoreau,"" the time-honored practice of self-righteously rejecting civilization by making other people interact with it on your behalf. It's not just the shots fired at ""tiresome and outdated"" typewriters. It's the entire gestalt of nostalgia, self-help, and conspicuous, generic literary fandom that it evokes. It makes me want to be elitist and anti-intellectual at the same time. Except that as an idea, I love it.   As its website readily admits, the Hemingwrite is a modern-day word processor. It combines a compact mechanical-switch keyboard (the high-quality alternative to standard rubber domes, beloved by gamers and typing enthusiasts) with a six-inch E Ink screen that shows you the time, the date, your words, and little else. Its internal storage will sync with Google Docs and Evernote, with what I can only imagine are fairly minimal software updates delivered over the air. It has a little handle, so you can carry it around. It's more convenient than the mechanical typewriter that I do, in fact, own (or the word processor and electric typewriters I grew up with.) It's more streamlined than the Wi-Fi-free netbook I successfully use for distraction-free writing, and it supposedly lasts several weeks longer than the laptop I usually end up trying to use for distraction-free writing. It's the kind of weird little single-use gadget that I love. It's even got echoes of the OLPC XO-1 that I was first fascinated, then hugely disappointed, by. Note that I am saying ""as an idea."" The Hemingwrite exists as a decent-looking prototype, and its creators seem truly dedicated to building the highest-quality final product they can manage. But I'm not sure it's possible to create the thing they promise: a complex, highly ecosystem-dependent device that ""lasts generations."" The most immediate point of comparison, the Model M, works because it has no mind of its own; it's a peripheral you can map onto anything that accepts keystrokes. No matter how good the hardware is, or how replaceable the battery, it's going to be tricky to base a device around cloud syncing and then make it survive the passage of different wireless standards and word processing software, especially if it somehow outlives the company that builds it. I'm not sure how much I'm willing to spend on a more convenient version of a half-dozen writing implements I already own. And I'd honestly feel a little embarrassed answering somebody's innocent ""what's that?"" with ""Oh, it's a Hemingwrite."" The Hemingwrite recently made the slate of semi-finalists for Engadget's Insert Coin inventor's competition, and it will be appearing in my home city of New York on November 7th.

As the web continues to take over the space of traditional magazines, many aspects of the publishing world have changed. Among them are the illustrations that accompany many articles — without the constraints of print, artists and designers can turn these into something more interactive. That means short animations and GIFs in addition to traditional illustrations. Davey has done all of the above for outlets ranging from Time to MacWorld, but the GIF is his specialty. ""As an artist they're fun because you know they'll likely be viewed more than once through,"" he explains, ""so you can build in details and rhythms that might go unnoticed in a purely linear format like video."" In some cases he even does both static and animated pieces for multiple formats. His illustrations for the Italian edition of Wired, for example, are featured in both the print and tablet versions. In the print magazine you'll see static, colorful designs of robots and monsters, but on an iPad they come alive with simple animation. ""I couldn't say whether I prefer print or online,"" he says, ""what's most satisfying is when an idea will work equally well in both."" GIFs are also incredibly shareable — which makes Davey's tumblr a particular delight — and they offer an extra degree of subtlety. Davey's wonderful Avengers GIF below, for example, looks like a simple illustration until you wait a few seconds. Davey was initially inspired by the comic books and cartoons he grew up with, which ultimately led him to study fine art. ""After tying myself in knots wrestling with the theoretical side of things, I ended up dropping out,"" he explains. This led him back to traditional illustration, ""which is where I should have been all along."" In addition to his editorial illustrations, Davey has also worked in advertising, comics, and more.

As CEO Tim Armstrong said in his memo today, AOL is a media company, with well-known brands like Huffington Post, Engadget, and TechCrunch under its umbrella. It also, unbelievably, still has a wildly profitable subscription business, a vestige of the dial-up days when it mailed people CD-ROMS and introduced them to the internet. But its fastest growing business is in advertising technology, and that is what Verizon wants to leverage. Before he was running AOL, Armstrong was a top sales executive at Google, which helped pioneer online ad exchanges with its DoubleClick division. Over the past few years, he brought that same approach to AOL, creating a real-time bidding platform that helps marketers buy space for their display and video ads on digital properties across the web. Revenue from this business grew at over 40 percent last November and 21 percent in its most recent quarter. By contrast, ad sales across its own properties has grown far slower, and sometimes fallen. ""The megatrend of video shifting online is just beginning and will drive consolidation through the ecosystem,"" says tech investor Rick Heitzmann.  ""Verizon's buy of AOL will cause some head-scratching among people who are stuck thinking that every industry is an island. Why would a wireless provider want to buy an online media site?"" said Forrester analyst James McQuivey. ""But the deal makes sense in a way that Comcast's intra-industry urge to buy Time Warner did not: With this move, Verizon will become a global media player, extending its reach to hundreds of millions more people than it could in its current business, at a much lower cost than trying to acquire a different network provider."" While most people think of Verizon as a mobile operator and cable company, it already has a large business in mobile advertising. It knows an awful lot about its customers, and helps marketers to target various demographics. Here's a quick explainer from Verizon's FAQ on its ad business: A number of former AOL employees shared the opinion this morning that Verizon would quickly move to spin out or close down the owned and operated media brands, focusing on the ad tech instead. Over at Recode, Peter Kafka got a few quick quotes from Armstrong, who left the door open to that possibility. And analysts concur. ""After Verizon sells off the bits it doesn't want or need, like the Huffington Post, it will actually have acquired a decent customer list at relatively low cost per head,"" says McQuivey. ""Not to mention advertiser relationships and ad selling and measurement technology it would have taken years to build. The net of this deal is good for Verizon."" Verizon said it expects the deal to close this summer, pending regulatory approval. Like the merger of Comcast and NBC Universal, this deal would combine a major content company with a network operator who owns the pipes. That kind of potential for conflict, especially around net neutrality, is another reason Verizon may want to spin out some of the media business. (Comcast had to make net neutrality concessions through 2018 to win approval.) Verizon has also made plans to launch its own streaming video service this summer, focusing on delivering video to mobile devices and perhaps going over the top into your living room. As Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said in today's press release on the purchase, his company has been ""strategically investing in emerging technology, including Verizon Digital Media Services and OTT, which taps into the market shift to digital content and advertising. AOL's advertising model aligns with this approach, and the advertising platform provides a key tool for us to develop future revenue streams."" AOL trails only Google and Facebook in terms of the number of people it reaches through online video. The irony of all this is that when AOL merged with Time Warner back in 2000, it had a similar vision. At that point AOL was playing the role of Verizon, the connector charging a monthly subscription to access a network. Time Warner was the media giant who would provide amazing synergies for advertising. That $183 billion mega-merger turned into one of the most infamous boondoggles in the history of corporate America. For all the talk of a tech bubble today, no matter how this deal goes, it will cost shareholders a lot less money than it did during the dot-com era.",0.5721361633493169,0.42786383665068306,0.7297332034130287,764,4.9816753926701569,427,6.0327868852459012,0,0,"Business, Tech"

The taxi-hailing service is one of several companies rumored to be interested in Nokia's mapping business, known as Here, including Facebook, Baidu, and a consortium of German car manufacturers. Uber hasn't commented on the potential sale, which is rumored to be announced by the end of this month, but it's not hard to see why it would be interested. Mapping is at the core of Uber's business. Its app has long been powered by Google Maps, in addition to mapping data from Apple and other companies, but its relationship with Google has recently chilled, with the two companies competing on new fronts. Earlier this year, Uber announced plans to develop self-driving car technology in partnership with Carnegie Mellon — a self-driving pioneer — and Google is reportedly looking to build its own self-driving taxi service. ""Uber would put it at the core of its own platform."" Google is still a major investor in Uber, which has been valued at $50 billion, and it may be premature to say the companies are ""at war"" over the future of transportation. But Uber has made recent moves to diversify its mapping services and bring them in-house. In March, the company acquired the mapping platform deCarta, and according to The New York Times, it's hired several mapping engineers in recent months. Acquiring Here could create further distance from Google, while providing Uber with a major foothold in the world of in-car navigation. Although Here's €2 billion ($2.2 billion) value is a steep drop from the $8 billion Nokia paid for it in 2008, the service still controls more than 80 percent of the global market for in-car navigation systems, and earned revenue of $1.1 billion in 2014. ""Here has done ‘ok' as a consumer app,"" Julie Ask, a mobile analyst at Forrester Research, said in an email, adding that the service has suffered from a ""lack of marketing [and] distribution as a native app on a small mobile OS."" But she says it still offers a ""toolbox of location technology"" that would reduce Uber's dependence on third parties: ""Uber would put it at the core of its own platform."" Other companies rumored to be involved in the bidding could use Here in different ways. Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and other members of the German automotive consortium are developing autonomous driving technology, and may be wary of relying on mapping software from Google, which has self-driving aspirations of its own. Chinese companies Alibaba and Baidu, which are also rumored to be in the running, could use Here to expand their online services, Bloomberg reports. (Baidu is also working on self-driving technology of its own.) ""It's extraordinarily difficult to get this type of mapping data."" Much of Here's value derives from the scarcity of comprehensive mapping technologies, which require significant investment and infrastructure to develop. Here — which was acquired by Nokia as Navteq in 2008 — is one of just a handful of companies that have sought to create their own mapping systems, together with Google, TomTom, and Apple, whose Maps app has been plagued by bugs. ""It's extraordinarily difficult to get this type of mapping data,"" Jamie Moss, an analyst at the research company Ovum, told The New York Times this month. ""Other than Google, Here is one of the few companies that can offer this data right now."" That explains the buzz that Here's potential sale has generated among tech giants. Nokia has reportedly been pitching the unit to Apple, Amazon, and Facebook, which began using Here maps in some mobile services earlier this month under a partnership with the company. Here's troves of data on locations and businesses could prove valuable to web companies like Facebook and Amazon, though it's not yet clear whether either are looking to bid on it. A crowded field of suitors Owning Here would deliver obvious benefits for Uber's taxi services, which rely on real-time traffic data to match riders and track chauffeurs, though it could also figure prominently in Uber's plans to expand beyond transportation. ""Uber is not a transport company, we don't own cars,"" Mark MacGann, Uber's head of public policy in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, told Bloomberg last month, echoing the company's go-to response to the myriad regulatory disputes it's faced across the world. Instead, Uber brands itself as a ""technology company"" built on logistical software that could extend beyond ride-sharing. So far, Uber's expansion has focused on delivery. Its UberEats food delivery service is already available in select cities, and the company has reportedly begun testing same-day delivery (à la Amazon and Google) for high-end retailers. Acquiring Here would add a new layer of valuable location data that Uber could use to enhance its existing services or sell to third parties — and that value would only grow as Uber continues to enter new markets. But it's still unclear whether the company's deep war chest will be enough to fend off what appears to be a crowded field of suitors.",0.5063931873457348,0.4936068126542652,0.8344534433101666,858,5.0384615384615383,427,6.1241217798594851,1,0,"Business, Tech, Transportation"

The articles, which are hosted on Facebook’s servers, are well designed and create a genuinely better experience than the typical 8-second wait for an article to load on the mobile web. But if the format proves successful, and Facebook maintains its dominance in distributing news online, publishers could become ever more dependent on a platform they can’t control. Those concerns may prove valid, but it hasn’t stopped big partners from signing up. Soon, many more publishers may feel that they don’t have a choice. Whatever happens, the arrival of instant articles marks a turning point in the evolution of the news. Instant articles will be available from nine publishers starting at 10 a.m. ET: the Times, BuzzFeed, The Atlantic, National Geographic, NBC News, The Guardian, BBC News, and Germany’s Bild and Der Spiegel. For now, you’ll only be able to see them on the iOS version of Facebook’s app; an Android version is forthcoming. Many instant articles won’t look much different from the links you’re already seeing as you scroll through your feed. But Facebook has created tools to help them stand out, including video ""covers"" that autoplay as you scroll. Once you tap, the article loads close to instantly — at least, it did for the handful stories I tested in a demonstration at Facebook’s headquarters. The app manages this using the same technology Facebook has used to get photos and videos to load quickly. It begins pre-loading the story as you approach it in your News Feed, and is able to show you the top of the story as soon as you tap. On the web, publishers typically lard their pages with dozens of modules for serving advertisements and analytics; one reason instant articles load faster is because they strip most of those out. Those who expected instant articles to be stripped-down dumps of text may be surprised at the extra features Facebook has built here. Publications get their logo on top of every story, along with a ""follow"" button that you can click to subscribe to their Facebook page and get more stories. Publishers can also opt to include authors’ and photographers’ Facebook photos at the top of the story; clicking takes you to their profiles and lets you to subscribe to their public posts. The body of the story can contain photos, image galleries, and videos, and publishers can use a web view to embed objects like tweets and interactive graphics. It's a new publishing format Facebook also built a handful of special interactions for instant articles, and is working on more. Photos can have audio captions, allowing a kind of internal narration for stories. Photos can also be geo-tagged; tapping the name of the location opens an interactive map. And you can like and comment on individual photos within stories, which gives them a higher chance of spreading throughout your social network. (Every thumbs-up and comment creates the possibility that a story will be created about it in your friends’ News Feeds.) The result is something more than a new user experience for opening the links you find on Facebook: it’s a new publishing format. And it’s one that publishers are going to take very seriously. ""This is a very exciting experiment,"" says Declan Moore, chief media officer for National Geographic, which has 35 million followers on Facebook. He acknowledged having some concerns about how Facebook’s role as a distributor of news would evolve. But ultimately, he said, it was in the organization’s interest to work with Facebook. Facebook’s ambitions as a distributor of news have grown slowly but steadily. It has been enormously successful: nearly one-third of Americans regularly get news from the app, according to the Pew Research Center. Along the way, it has become a primary channel of distribution for the media, creating huge new audiences for new media companies while launching the most successful of them to multi-billion-dollar valuations. Most people surveyed by Pew say they don’t seek out news on Facebook, but they see so much of it there for a reason: it makes them use Facebook more. The more we clicked links to articles on Facebook, the more of them that Facebook showed us. From Facebook’s perspective, though, there’s a significant problem with this arrangement. One is that links take an average of 8 seconds to load in a mobile browser after someone clicks a link — an eternity, by software standards. ""Speed is the most important feature for any mobile software,"" said Chris Cox, Facebook’s chief product officer. ""Photos, text, video. We keep learning the lesson that if it’s not delivered instantly, you’re losing a bunch of the goodness that could have happened."" The point of instant articles, then, is to retain the … goodness. By eliminating the lag between tapping and reading, Facebook expects people will spend more time in the News Feed reading articles. While it hasn’t done a formal test of user behavior yet, Cox says, early results from employees’ usage of instant articles has been encouraging. Work on the format began in earnest about six months ago, and was led by the team behind Paper, Facebook’s effort to reimagine the service as a mobile app geared toward news consumption. Paper’s reliance on interactive gestures — tilting your phone, say, or swiping up to open an article — made it something of a design curiosity, and it languished on the download charts. ""Paper was like a short film that let us explore a lot of things."" But Cox says Paper contained the seeds of what became instant articles. ""Pixar spends a lot of time building these short films where they can develop technology that they can then apply to their longer films,"" he says. ""For us, Paper was like a short film that let us explore a lot of things without the constraint of, a billion people need to be able to use this."" At the same time, Facebook’s growing power as a news distributor creates new revenue opportunities. Starting with the launch, publishers can now let Facebook sell ads on their instant articles, splitting revenue with Facebook. Or they can choose to sell the ads themselves, and keep all the revenue — for now, anyway. I asked Justin Osofsky, Facebook’s vice president of media partnerships, whether that was a limited-time offer that would change over time. ""We’re committed to working with publishers in a way that gives them tools to build their business,"" he said. So eventually you’ll take, what, 20, 30 percent? I asked. ""We’re going to work with publishers to give them tools that build their business,"" he repeated, unblinking. Here’s a scenario that may play out over the next year or so. Instant articles prove popular, driving significant new traffic and revenue to Facebook’s launch partners. More publishers join the platform, even modifying their publishing tools to let writers incorporate instant-article features into their stories. Meanwhile, traditional links shared on Facebook become less effective as readers migrate toward instant articles. Having hooked readers on instant articles — and publishers on the revenue they generate — Facebook starts taking an increasing percentage of ad revenue. What appeared to the media as a friendly tweak to the user interface was really a trap. This possibility has been explored with mordant fatalism by The Awl’s John Herrman, whose Content Wars series has presented Facebook’s offer to publishers in the bleakest terms. It is true that Facebook began to explore hosting news not primarily as a means of supporting independent journalism or related civic virtues but rather to maximize the amount of time spent in the News Feed. As Herrman put it: The prospect of Facebook, for example, as a primary host for news organizations, not just an outsized source of traffic, is depressing even if you like Facebook. A new generation of artists and creative people ceding the still-fresh dream of direct compensation and independence to mediated advertising arrangements with accidentally enormous middlemen apps that have no special interest in publishing beyond value extraction through advertising is the early internet utopian’s worst-case scenario. At this point it feels necessary to point out that the fortunes of The Verge itself, along with its parent company, Vox Media, are likely to be affected by Facebook’s experiment with instant articles one way or another. Though not a partner yet, Vox has talked with Facebook about a partnership, according to a person familiar with the matter. If Vox adopts instant articles and they become a huge success, The Verge could benefit directly. If it doesn’t, and instant articles become the default mode of publishing on Facebook, The Verge could suffer the consequences. The arithmetic around risk, revenues, and the future of media distribution involve calculations whose variables are impossible to estimate right now. Yet it’s an equation every publisher of appreciable size — Vox included — must try to solve. Much of the fear comes down to this: Facebook has already established itself as more important than even Google as a referrer of traffic to online publications. Failing to get the math right on instant articles could be tantamount to failing, period. Perhaps the most important thing to note about Facebook’s instant articles is that they feel inevitable. Content hosted on apps rather than websites isn’t the future of media — it’s the present. Last fall BuzzFeed started BFF, its ""distributed media"" division. The roughly 10-person team creates images, videos, tweets, and various other forms of content for every major social network. Nothing links back to BuzzFeed.com. For now, BuzzFeed doesn’t advertise on any of its social channels. But mastering social networks and growing large audiences there will likely allow the company to develop lucrative native ads for those platforms. (The multi-platform approach also gives the company a hedge against an eventual Facebook decline.) And it’s not the only one. NowThis, a digital video outlet backed by a co-founder of The Huffington Post, has raised $15.6 million for a news organization that famously doesn’t have a homepage. Instead, it specializes in lurid autoplay videos for Facebook designed to be watched with the sound off; the story is told with text overlaid on a mix of news footage and pop-culture memes. Meanwhile, First Look Media last year launched Reportedly, which greeted the world with a manifesto about the virtues of content hosted directly on social platforms. (It hosts its reporting primarily on Medium.) But while distributed media on other platforms is still experimental, on Facebook it feels inevitable. And while publishers’ concerns about Facebook’s level of control are understandable, they may also be overstated. The good old New York Times, which has endured its share of tectonic shifts in the media landscape over the past 150 years, approached its Facebook deal with an admirable level of confidence. ""Our experience has been when you grow your off-platform audience, generally, you grow your on-platform audience as well,"" Mark Thompson, the company’s president, said in February at Recode’s Code/Media event. A move that feels inevitable Thompson noted that the Times had previously struck — and survived — deals with earlier internet giants including AOL and Yahoo. A decade later, similarly dire warnings about the future of media arose when Google began scraping headlines for its Google News service. There were warnings about the end of media then, too, and yet everything turned out more or less okay. Or rather, they turned out as well as anything ever turns out in media, which is to say that smart people still tell great stories, and advertisers still pay to reach their audiences, and most of the paychecks are still clearing. When it comes to hosted content, Thompson believes every case is different. ""My starting assumption,"" he said, ""is typically you’re better playing the game.""",0.8549499195969739,0.14505008040302614,0.31236774673048073,1988,5.1841046277665992,928,6.4978448275862073,0,12,"Apps, Business, Tech, Web, Report"

The American mobile giant describes this as a ""significant step in building digital and video platforms to drive future growth."" Having AOL's digital content and advertising expertise is seen as a major asset in advancing Verizon's strategy to monetize LTE wireless video and other over-the-top video services. Even so, it's amusing that the first key AOL asset mentioned in the press release is the enduring (eternal?) subscription business that has kept it in business for so long. Beyond that, there are significant brands in online publishing such as The Huffington Post (which AOL acquired in 2011 for $315 million), Engadget, and TechCrunch. This marks the biggest transaction for Verizon after completing a $130 billion buyout of Vodafone from its Verizon Wireless business last year. Interestingly, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam denied rumors in January of being in talks to acquire AOL, suggesting that it and other media companies should be considered suitable candidates for partnerships rather than complete takeovers. Today, McAdam says that ""AOL has once again become a digital trailblazer, and we are excited at the prospect of charting a new course together in the digitally connected world."" For its part, AOL will retain current CEO and chairman Tim Armstrong as its leader of operations after completion of the deal. The Verge has obtained a copy of the memo issued by Armstrong to all AOL staff in the wake of the big announcement: AOLers – As you have heard me say many times over the last 5 years since we became an independent AOL, we are building toward becoming the largest media technology company in the world. While there are search platforms, social platforms, and commerce platforms, we have built a very meaningful media platform and AOL today is a media platform company powering our brands and the brands of over 30,000 partners. If there is one key to our journey to building the largest digital media platform in the world, it is mobile. Mobile will represent 80% of consumers’ media consumption in the coming years and if we are going to lead, we need to lead in mobile. Over the last 18 months we set a goal of moving AOL into a leading position in mobile, mobile video, and mobile registered consumers. We are approaching 400 million global consumers, we have built one of the best advertising platforms in the world, and we have one of the most talented teams in the world – and now it is time for us to fully open up the mobile frontier. Today, we are announcing that the largest and most innovative wireless and cable company – and the one investing the most in high quality mobile content – is acquiring AOL with the strategy of building the biggest media platform in the world. The company is Verizon and the deal will game-change the size and scale of AOL’s opportunity. Just as AOL has propelled The Huffington Post, Adap.tv, TechCrunch, and other companies we have acquired, Verizon will propel AOL and comes to the table with over 100 million mobile consumers, content deals with the likes of the NFL, and a meaningful strategy in mobile video. The decision to enter into an agreement with Verizon was made over a long and thoughtful time period and both companies see significant opportunity to service consumers and customers in a differentiated and exciting way. On a personal level, the decision to go forward with an agreement was predicated on giving our talent the best opportunity to build a multi-decade business that would be deeply growth oriented and aimed directly at the platform shift that video and mobile are offering the world – today and 20 years from now. There are two important questions you might have at this point in the letter: What does this mean? What does this mean for me (meaning you)? The deal means we will be a division of Verizon and we will oversee AOL’s current assets plus additional assets from Verizon that are targeted at the mobile and video media space. The deal will not change our strategy – it will expand it greatly.  The deal will give our content businesses more distribution and it will give our advertisers more distribution and mobile-first features. The deal will add scale and it will add a mobile lens to everything we do inside of our content, video, and ads strategy. For you this means growth, it means mobile, and it means compensation that will be equal or better to your AOL compensation. Your benefits will not change in 2015. We will eventually go on Verizon’s benefit plan, but that won’t happen until 2016 or later and we will work with Verizon to make sure the benefits are strong and cover important areas of people's lives. Your job and what you do on a daily basis should be enhanced by the market opportunity this deal is targeted to capture. The simple answer to the question of ""what does this mean for you?"" should be, ""I just got more resources, more support and more growth opportunity."" The leadership at AOL is staying and I am staying – enthusiastically, and we made that part of the deal. We have the opportunity to build a unique and globally scaled media technology company with the scale and resources we need to make that happen. Verizon and AOL are very large partners today – in content, in ads, and in the technology. We know their team well and they know our team well. The cultures share very similar values and are both working on very similar ways to do good while doing well. Diversity and women’s leadership are at the top of both companies’ agendas and we look forward to having a consumer and industry impact on those important issues. The future in front of AOL and the industry requires scale, mobile, and video – and partnerships. In our lifetime, we will see the connection of the world on very large and very fast networks – and to play in that world with our strategy requires us to take the natural steps to secure our ability to shoot for the stars. This deal is aimed at the stars and we are going to pursue the joint vision of building the most significant media platform in the world.  I have been a buyer of AOL over the last 5 years – and that is an investment in one thing – our talent. We have reviewed every hire coming into the company over the last 5 years and we have taken extraordinary risks and faced extraordinary challenges over the last 5 years. There is nothing more meaningful than watching our team turn-around this great company and restoring it to growth when most people had left it for dead. AOL is back and now we are joining forces with Verizon to build the best media technology company in the world.

In the first quarter of 2014, mobile accounted for more than three quarters of Samsung Electronic's operating profit, but since then things have taken a turn for the worse, with the division's earnings falling 42 percent last year. A new report from The Wall Street Journal shows how Samsung has been shifting gears to deal with this challenge, including sending tens of thousands of machines to its factories in Asia to help the Galaxy S6 match the premium, metal construction of Apple's iPhones. Samsung has switched chips and dropped products to boost profits ""To switch to aluminum-alloy bodies similar to what Apple uses, Samsung shipped more than 20,000 metal-milling machines to its Vietnam factories,"" says the report. The company has also aimed to boost profits by using its own chips in the Galaxy S6 and cut costs by trimming its sprawling product line — previously the company's signature mobile strategy. While Samsung's massive scale was once its greatest asset, allowing it to make bumper profits as long as its smartphones sold in huge numbers, this advantage has been eaten away as consumers have turned to low- and mid-range Chinese devices. The question is now whether or not the S6 can turn things around for the company. After positive reviews, company executives have said that they expect the S6 and S6 Edge to be the best-selling devices in the Galaxy series, predicting that they will sell more than 70 million units. However, with recent shipment figures from China showing Samsung slipping into fourth place behind Apple, Xiaomi, and Huawei, the future of the company's mobile division is still far from certain.

The goal is a sort of self-aware GoPro that you will allow anyone to be their own aerial cinematographer. Today a startup called Lily is trying to move a step closer to that future with a drone that you can literally just toss into the air and then ignore, leaving it to pilot itself. It senses when you jump and goes into slow-mo mode The Lily was created by Antoine Balaresque and Henry Bradlow, who met while studying computer science and working at the UC Berkeley Robotics Laboratory. To follow its subject, it relies on a small GPS tracker that the user carries in their pocket or wears on their wrist, but the drone also incorporates computer vision technology that can recognize its owner and use algorithms to more precisely frame them within a scene. The tracking device also records audio that syncs with your video, something no other drone offers, as the rotors would typically drown out sound. ""Cameras right now are limited by the skill of the human operator. Most of the time that means non-professionals getting less than ideal shots,"" says Bradlow. ""With a flying camera, you can get amazing shots and angles regardless of who is using it."" For example, sensor data from the tracker can automatically trigger a slow mode or burst mode when it senses you going off a jump. It shoots in 1080p at 60 frames per second and captures 12 megapixel stills. Sitting beside you waiting for that perfect wave In terms of hardware, the Lily was built to mimic the attributes of an action cam, with a polycarbonate hull that can withstand a hard crash. For extra protection, the camera is internal, not mounted on an exterior gimbal. It’s rated as waterproof to IP67, putting it on par with the recent Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone. The pitch here is that you can drop it off the side of your kayak or let it float next to your surfboard while you wait for the moment to have it launch, follow, and film you. The construction has some trade-offs. To keep the waterproof ability and extend flight time to over 20 minutes, for example, the creators decided to forgo a battery you can swap in and out, so you have to charge the entire unit.   The device goes on sale today for pre-order at $499, a major discount from the $999 retail price that the company is planning when the Lily goes on sale. The duo has raised venture funding from Upside Partnership, SV Angel, and High Line Venture Partners. But they are following the tried and true model of crowdfunding the first run of a new hardware offering, hoping to engage a dedicated fan base, sharpen the product market fit, and of course get a nice helping of interest-free working capital. The self-stabilization is impressive The Lily is extremely ambitious. While many consumer drones now offer the ability to take off and land with the push of a button, and promise that they can return home to you with just a tap, the Lily takes all those capabilities one step further. I went out to a park in New York City with the founders to see it in action. You chuck the Lily up in the air, and it flips and tumbles for a second, before suddenly righting itself and hovering in place. It’s an impressive feat of midair stabilization. You can see fun near-disaster highlights below. The founders all showed me a quick demo of the Lily coming in for a landing in the palm of your hand, relying on computer vision and a downward facing camera. This would let the Lily finish a flight without having to find a flat surface. It seemed very cool, and also very risky, given how close your hands are to the rotors. All that makes the Lily stand out as a vision for the simplest possible implementation of a drone. It’s a lot like the Airdog and Hexo+ units we saw at CES. Once it’s launched, all flight is based on filming you. Using an app or handheld unit, it's possible to shift from a follow mode to a pan to a 360-degree selfie. Right now there is no sense and avoid But both of the drones we saw at CES still require a stable surface for takeoff, something that could be hard to find when you’re scaling a sheer rock face or tubing through some white water. While this is exciting, the Lily doesn’t yet have any capabilities for sense and avoid, meaning it won’t dodge passing trees, ski lifts, or fellow surfers. For now you will need to use it in a fairly wide open space. The founders believe that removing most of the manual controls provides a simplicity that will make the Lily accessible to both gadget nerds and dabblers. ""We set out to build a flying camera from scratch, one anyone could use,"" says Balaresque. The feature set on the Lily will definitely appeal to the action sports crowd, although I have a hard time imagining a senior citizen feeling comfortable trying to catch a drone.",0.6214979603183305,0.3785020396816695,0.1738264735187395,876,4.5696347031963471,484,5.7789256198347108,0,4,"Business, Tech, Report"

That's the lesson from a new case reported in The Coloradoan, which saw one couple's Spotify and Netflix accounts used to track them after they fled to Mexico. The fugitives were Brittany Nunn and her husband Peter Barr, who fled their home in Wellington, Colorado after losing a custody battle over Nunn's two children. The court had awarded primary custody of the two sisters — six and four years old, respectively — to their biological fathers. But Nunn and her husband defied the order, spurring a seven-month manhunt that drew in local, state, and federal investigators alongside private detectives hired by the fathers. The fugitive couple was finally located through a search warrant served to Spotify. According to the company's records, the couple's account had been used by an IP address in Mexico, although the limits of US law prevented a more specific identification. The lead was confirmed by similar records from Netflix, and investigators finally traced a package delivered to Nunn to a Cabo address. From there, federal agents worked with the Mexican consulate on bringing the couple and the abducted children back to the US. It's a clever tactic and a reminder of how many modern services can quietly give away a user's location. For Fourth Amendment purists, the story is also a reminder that old-fashioned warrants are still a perfectly viable way to track down criminals.

It only makes sense, then, that ISPs should bear the burden of limiting piracy on their sites, especially when they are profiting from the piracy and have the technology to conduct automates searches and takedowns. Placing the burden of identifying pirated content on the individual author, who has no ability to have any real impact on piracy, as the current regime does, makes no sense at all. It is technology that has enabled the pirate marketplace to flourish, and it is technology alone that has the capacity to keep it in check.

Chapo disappeared on Saturday night while taking a shower in his cell. His method of escape? An elaborately built tunnel that stretched nearly a mile from the prison walls. A massive search is now underway around the prison, which is about 90 minutes from Mexico City. According to reports, the country's national security commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido said in a press conference that authorities found the opening near the shower area shortly after he was last seen around 9PM on Saturday. Guards entered the cell only to find that Chapo was nowhere to be found. They did find a hatch with a 20-by-20-inch opening that led to the escape tunnel via a ladder. Elaborate tunnel equipped with a ""motorcycle-on-rails."" This main tunnel appeared to be a major undertaking — it was about 30 feet deep, tall enough to stand in, and 2.5 feet wide. It also had PVC piping for insulation, a lighting system, and what's being described as a ""motorcycle-on-rails"" that was either used to whisk Chapo away or to facilitate construction. There were also construction materials and canisters of fuel and oxygen left in the tunnel. After running about a mile, it popped up at a construction site in the town of Almoloya de Juárez. Chapo has a history with elaborate tunnels. His Sinaloa cartel has built tunnels at border towns to smuggle drugs, weapons, and cash into and out of the US. According to The Washington Post, US officials have found hundreds of such tunnels, some of which are similarly equipped to the tunnel that freed Chapo. A complex network of tunnels at one of his Mexican homes have also helped him evade arrest attempts in the past. Chapo could be responsible for up to 80,000 deaths The drug lord was arrested just over a year ago in Mexico. It was a stunning arrest for a notorious criminal who seemed to be above the law in Mexico. The arrest was the result of a joint effort between Mexico's paramilitary forces and US intelligence, and was a major political coup for President Enrique Peña Nieto, who has run on a policy of bringing major drug lords to justice. The US informally sought to the have Chapo extradited and held in an American prison after the arrest, but Mexico decided to detain the kingpin on its side of the border as a point of pride. Chapo is said to be worth as much as a billion dollars and could be responsible for 80,000 deaths over the years. US authorities say his cartel is the largest importer of cocaine and marijuana, and in recent years it's said to be behind over 50 percent of heroin smuggled into the US. Nevertheless, he evaded capture for years thanks to influence, fear, power, and money. Deep-seated corruption through all levels of the Mexican government has made it possible for notorious criminals like Chapo to avoid prison. The last time Chapo was arrested, back in 2001, he escaped in a laundry cart — though many suspect that bribes and cooperation from prison staff led to the escape. And it appears the escape this weekend was no different.",0.34191692093288933,0.6580830790671106,0.8562678062678,541,4.7837338262476896,306,5.8986928104575167,0,0,US & World

Today, the campaign put up its own gigantic explainer, covering why the former secretary of state stored mail on a private server instead of an official State Department account, whether that server violated government transparency policies, and how she decided what to hand over for public release. The fact sheet aggregates news coverage, quotes from Clinton's speeches, and known statistics. It repeats, for example, that she ""opted to use her personal email account as a matter of convenience."" Clinton once again says she maintained transparency by sending her messages to other people's official State Department accounts, and that she handed over the entire work-related portion of her messages to the State Department before the scandal leaked. Unsurprisingly, the Clinton campaign concludes that this was entirely legal. Outside fact-checking group Politifact (which Clinton quotes favorably) is less sure that she followed the spirit, or even the letter, of the law. A collection of just about everything Clinton has said about her email Whatever its spin, the page genuinely tries to address every single question about Clinton's communication, right down to whether she read emails on her iPad as well as her BlackBerry. This does actually matter, to a point — she's said she used a non-governmental email address so she could carry just one device instead of two. (Weirdly, parts of the answer also double as great promotional quote fodder. ""When the iPad came out in 2010, she was as curious as others and found it great for shopping, browsing, and reading articles when she traveled"" would fit right in at the next Apple event.) But it's probably less important than some of the questions she hedged, like the server's security measures. It's fun to think that digital security and government transparency have genuinely become important enough to deserve a place beside economic growth and equal pay laws. But the email scandal has gotten so much play partly because of the ongoing Benghazi attack investigation, which centers on Clinton's actions as secretary of state.

Or such is the hope, anyhow. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras spent the weekend negotiating with fellow Eurozone heads of government in Brussels, where Sunday was set as the deadline for agreeing terms to resume negotiations for a new bailout for the already twice-bailed-out country. Those terms have now been agreed, and the threat of a Grexit — Greece exiting the Euro currency — appears to have been averted. EuroSummit has unanimously reached agreement. All ready to go for ESM programme for #Greece with serious reforms & financial support  The particular details of the deal are still filtering out, but the buildup to the decision was filled with apprehension, which found expression through a pair of trending hashtags on Twitter: #ThisIsACoup and #TsiprasLeaveEUSummit. New York Times economist Paul Krugman endorsed the former hashtag in a withering essay on Sunday criticizing the ""pure vindictiveness [and] complete destruction of national sovereignty"" inherent in the proposed measures. Those hashtags have been succeeded by #Greekment as the prevailing topic in Greece's social channels, following the announcement of an ""a-Greek-ment"" by European Council leader Donald Tusk. Still, the sentiment expressed hasn't changed: the feeling is that Tsipras is capitulating to his creditors' demands in order to get any sort of deal done. We don't want the Greek word ""EUROPE"" to represent this mess. #ThisIsACoup #greekment  A nation's dignity tramped on and a prime minister degraded into a punching bag, but at least we have a new word out of this: #greekment  The Greek Parliament is now expected to legislate swiftly to codify the proposed reforms into law and thus speed the introduction of new European financial support for the country's economy. The present negotiations have been colored by a great deal of mistrust and resentment, both of which were fueled by Tsipras' sudden decision to break off talks a couple of weeks ago and hand the decision over to his people in a referendum. The Greeks emphatically rejected the previous reform package that was proposed, with parties in the streets of Athens underlining their unwillingness to be bullied by the continent's wealthier nations. It's a minor miracle that Greece's creditors have now agreed on a new package of reforms and financial aid following that show of rebellion, but it appears that European solidarity has prevailed over petty politics. I don't know if I should be relieved or absolutely terrified over the #Greekment. I guess I'm somewhere between. At least, we fought.  As important a decision as this is for the future stability of Greece (and Europe in general), the approval of the Greek people is still required. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has expressed his confidence that a Grexit is no longer a threat and that the Greek Parliament will indeed follow through with its promises. But if Tsipras has indeed compromised on many of the issues that his voters told him not to, how effective will the new legislation be?

A new report from The Guardian digs into who has been using the new feature, using information accidentally revealed in the source code of Google's recent transparency report. The new data covers the 218,320 requests that were made between May 2014 and March 2015, roughly three-quarters of the total requests, slightly less than half of which (101,461) resulted in a successful delisting. The data has also been published on GitHub, and is open for deeper analysis. Google breaks the requests into five categories: private personal information, child protection, political requests, public figures, or serious crimes. The vast majority of requests (more than 95 percent) were for personal information, ranging from requests to delist a personal address to delisting a person's name entirely. By contrast, fewer than 200 child protection requests were received during the period. In a statement to The Guardian, Google emphasized that the codes were part of an internal project to categorize requests, which was ultimately deemed not reliable enough for public release. Still, the new data sheds new light on the larger legal project of the right to be forgotten. Google has strenuously objected to the right to be forgotten on free speech grounds and has dedicated significant legal resources to fighting it in court. Those efforts have largely been successful in the US, but European Union courts have treated the ability to remove information from Google Search as an important privacy measure, particularly in protecting children and the victims of crimes from unwanted publicity. The new data suggests that those use cases, while legally compelling, represent a vanishingly small portion of the overall requests. 7/14 1:05pm ET: Updated to include the data's Github page.",0.8291375817388829,0.17086241826111714,0.8509046339826819,309,5.375404530744337,198,6.308080808080808,0,0,"Google, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World"

Also, there's a fashion film with David Beckham. So that's cool. Check all of this week's best out below.   SPOILER ALERT. But seriously, this is epic.   If you couldn't get enough of Neil deGrasse Tyson's Cosmos, this promo for The Martian should definitely be of interest. The entire clip has Tyson doing a fake science show where he explains what's involved in a trip to Mars and a little bit about The Martian's fictional history. Here's looking forward to the real version of this, whenever that comes. The movie arrives on October 2nd.   Bruce Campbell may be a lot older, but he's still having just as much fun. Ash vs Evil Dead looks like a glorious, indulgent return to the B-movie horror that The Evil Dead started way back in 1981. He'll be back in action beginning October 31st. The series airs on Starz.   Kill Your Friends is like American Psycho meets Britpop. If you're into one or both of those things, it looks like this movie should be a lot of fun. (This first trailer contains very brief nudity.) It's out in the UK on November 6th.   Do you want to see Bill Murray messing around for a couple hours in movie Afghanistan with a bunch of other wonderful stars in a film that is almost certain to have cultural problems but may well woo you with all of its energy? Then check out the trailer for Rock the Kasbah, which pretty much fits the bill. It's out October 23rd.   Get nostalgic, music fans. All Things Must Pass is director Colin Hanks' look back at Tower Records, from its heyday as a musical epicenter to its eventual closure. This documentary seems to be far more about what Tower Records was than what became of it — after all, it's not really a secret why a record store would go out business. The documentary comes out October 16th.   Youth is all about Michael Caine playing an old dude, which is basically wonderful. Plus, Rachel Weisz, Harvey Keitel, Paul Dano, and Jane Fonda are in it. The trailer turns super emotional, but the film seems like a good excuse to just let these people do some great acting. It played at Cannes this spring and should be out later this year.   Okay, bear with me for a minute because this is awesome: David Beckham has a clothing line with the fashion brand Belstaff. Belstaff has now enlisted Beckham, Katherine Waterston, and Harvey Keitel to make a fashion film. It's called Outlaws, and it's apparently about a circus and a handsome dude on a motorcycle.

That's starting to change. The Wall Street Journal reports that Nielsen is currently months into a program that allows it to track shows on Netflix and other services like Amazon Prime and Hulu, and it now has data on nearly 1,000 shows — including how many people watch an episode and information like age and gender. Nielsen hopes that the data it shares can help studios negotiate for higher licensing fees from services if the shows that stream online are shown to do well. Nielsen started measuring viewership data on streaming sites last winter as a means of giving major studios like Twentieth Century Fox and NBCUniversal a clearer sense of how streaming affects their revenue. Studios still make more money from traditional, ad-supported television, but subscription-based streaming has been eating into TV viewership for some time now. Charging Netflix and Amazon for popular shows can help stem any losses from audiences changing their viewing habits. Nielsen still doesn't track streaming content on mobile devices The data Nielsen is tracking is still fairly limited, though, since it doesn't include viewership from mobile devices or overseas subscribers. Nielsen has plans to include those metrics, but Netflix uses those limits to dismiss the effort out of hand. Meanwhile, the streaming giant also already provides certain well-paying studios with information on how often a show is streamed on a monthly basis. However, Netflix has reason to be a little nervous.

It's not necessarily a new idea — HTC did this with its ""Zoe"" camera mode, and others have tried similar feats — but Apple has the advantage of building Live Photos into one of the world's most popular phones (and cameras). It's important to remember that the new iPhones have a bigger sensor this time around (12 megapixels), and Live Photos is likely to take up more space than a normal picture, so you're likely going to fill the phone's storage space much faster this time around.

Update: Read the Apple iPhone 6S review. While the furor quickly died down, Apple may have taken the complaints to heart. At today's event in San Francisco, the company stated that the new iPhones are made out of reportedly stronger 7000 series aluminum, the same material used in the Apple Watch. While Apple chiefs never spoke directly to the controversy, the material change will hopefully prevent the devices from bending in a back pocket. Your existing iPhone 6 / 6 Plus cases may not fit on the 6s / 6s Plus. The weight gain isn't surprising. pic.twitter.com/idOPFGYoBZ  Apple went on the offensive in the wake of Bendgate last year, inviting journalists to its Cupertino testing facility to prove that the 6 and 6 Plus could weather normal scenarios that would cause it to bend. The company line at the time was that any phone, when put under enough stress, could bend. Still, Apple would certainly much rather not have to make that point ever again. It's still not clear if the change will address the complaints, so we'll have to put the phones through their paces to see how they fare after everyday use. Still, if Apple took a moment to call out its new materials, it hopefully means something. Correction: An earlier version of this story implied that the iPhone 6S was heavier because of 7000 series aluminum. While it is slightly more dense, the new display is the primary culprit.

Is this what will reignite the tablet market? There's Apple's best-seller — the iPhone — and then there's iPad. That's not to say that iPad is a poor product; quite the opposite, actually, with the word ""iPad"" having become synonymous with ""tablet."" The issue is around tablets themselves. Consumers don't upgrade them as often as they do smartphones, and iPad sales have been slumping. Apple's solution? Going all in on iPad, showing off a souped-up version of iPad today called iPad Pro. If you've been reading the rumors leading up to the event, you're not remotely surprised by this. What I was surprised by, when I got some hands-on time with the tab today, is just how large it is. It has a 12.9-inch diagonal display. This is not your iPad mini, or any other 7-inch tab. This is not a cross between a tablet and a phablet. It doesn't even feel comparable to your standard 10-inch variety. It feels...big. Technically, it's slightly thicker than last year's iPad Air 2 (6.9mm thin vs. 6.1mm thin), and it weighs about a half a pound more. All that said, given its size and 10-hour battery claims, it's still remarkably light. So, aside from size and the fact that it has 78 percent more screen area than other iPads, what makes this worthy of the ""Pro"" moniker? First off, it's running on Apple's new A9X processor, which the company says is a desktop-class CPU. Yes, Apple made a stylus. This is the part where the iPad Pro starts to sound a lot like Microsoft's Surface tablet. The aesthetics are very different, but until we can get our hands on the iPad Pro for an extended period of time it's tough to say exactly how powerful it is (or how useful its accessories are). I can tell you that the $99, all-white stylus felt light in the hand when I used it to scribble in Notes and draw on a picture in Apple's native Mail app. When I used the Pencil at an angle, I was able to alter the boldness of my writing or shade just as you would with an actual writing utensil. It also felt fast, unlike some styluses that suffer from latency issues. But again, I didn't use it for an extended period of time. As with Microsoft's Surface Pro stylus, you can use it with certain applications, but not all applications. There's also an iPad cover that doubles as a magnetic ""smart"" keyboard, that will sell for $169 with iPad Pro. It's covered in connective fabric, and the keyboard itself has no internal battery; it's powered entirely by the iPad. Most shortcut commands are the same as the ones on a standard Mac, though some app-specific commands are likely to emerge as developers make iPad apps with the keyboard in mind. Of course, Microsoft also makes a snap-in accessory keyboard for its Surface tablet. Perhaps fittingly, Microsoft executive Kirk Koenigsbauer was the first person Apple's Phil Schiller welcomed on stage after the iPad Pro announcement, to show the capabilities of Office for iPad on the new tab. A new Adobe app, called Adobe Fix, was demonstrated as well. A woman's unsmiling face was automagically turned into a smiling one, with Adobe Fix. The iPad Pro will ship in November and starts at $799 for a 32GB device. For one with 128GB of storage, you're looking at $1,079.

And both are coming out later this fall: the TV in October, the iPad in November. But the biggest news for most people will probably be the regular iPhone updates: the 6S and larger 6S Plus. While the design looks a lot like the last-generation iPhone 6, it’s been redesigned with better specs and a more complex “3D touch” interface. Before you start learning the approximately 300 new synonyms for “tap” that will become common in the coming months, take a look at the rest of the news below.   The new iPad Pro has the biggest screen on an iOS device (and a bigger screen than some OS X devices.) At 12.9 inches, it can support a full-sized virtual keyboard, and will be the first iPad to feature an optional physical keyboard and stylus. The Pro will have an A9X memory chip, making it 1.8x faster than the A8X chip that’s in the iPad Air 2, and Apple claims it's faster than 80 percent of portable PCs (i.e. laptops) shipped in the past six months. The iPad Pro's new four-speaker audio setup will also rebalance itself based on how you hold it. The 10-hour battery life and 5.6 million pixels will also help it compete with traditional laptops — or other tablet and keyboard combinations. Update: Read the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus review. Apple invited Microsoft and Adobe up to demonstrate iPad Pro-focused versions of their iOS apps — Adobe Photoshop Fix is a new app that lets you quickly retouch photos using the stylus, while PowerPoint will now convert stylus ink into objects that you can use in your slides. The tablet is being positioned as a professional tool, with a price to match. The 32GB edition will cost you $799, while the 128GB will be $949, and LTE support bumps up the 128GB to $1079. The iPad Pro will be available in November in silver, gold, and space grey versions.   Steve Jobs may have famously trashed styluses when the original iPad came out, but times have changed. The $99 Apple Pencil is a dedicated iPad Pro stylus that will allow for precision drawing and can be used simultaneously with a finger. Granted, Apple is jumping into a market that’s been filled by third-party designers for years, so anyone who absolutely needed a stylus for the smaller, existing iPads probably already has one. The same goes for the other new iPad Pro peripheral: a $169 woven ""smart keyboard"" case that looks a lot like Microsoft’s surface keyboards. Even if they’re not new concepts, this is the first time Apple has made its own versions of these accessories, positioning them as an integral part of the product. They’ll be out in November, along with the iPad Pro. While the iPad Pro brought a huge refresh to the iPad today, the iPad mini news was a little… smaller. The refreshed iPad mini 4, a new 7.9-inch tablet with the ""power of the iPad Air 2,"" will cost $399, and the iPad mini 2 will see a price reduction to $269. The iPad Air didn’t see an update today, but the original Air will cost $399 while the Air 2 will cost $499.   The long overdue Apple TV is here, and it’ll run a separate OS, called… tvOS. As expected, the new Apple TV will have a Universal Search feature that lets you search across apps like iTunes, Netflix, and Hulu, and it will feature Siri in a big way. Similar to other set-top boxes, voice search will be the primary way to navigate. You can manually fast-forward by sliding your finger forward on the touchpad, but also do a quick 15 second rewind by asking Siri, ""what did she say?"" The Apple TV will double as a gaming console — including games like the new Guitar Hero that were previously only available on consoles — and the UI has also been refreshed, featuring a new white background and redesigned apps. The new Apple TV is also far more powerful — it features a 64-bit A8 processor and can support Bluetooth 4.0. The new Apple TV will launch in October, at $149 for the 32GB version, and $199 for 64GB. Apple’s humble TV remote has gotten a major makeover. The new device is a combination of traditional media remote, glass trackpad, motion controller, and Siri invocation tool. This Siri integration lets users do things like get movie recommendations and look up sports scores or the weather while watching TV. Turned sideways, it’s also a rudimentary gaming pad. It’s a little reminiscent of, among other things, Amazon’s FireTV remote — which had different hardware features but a similar blend of traditional media controls, search options, and gaming controls. Today, Apple doubled down on its prediction that apps are the future of television. The fourth-generation Apple TV finally has an Apple Music app, a feature that’s been noticeably absent since the service launched in June. It will function in the same way as its iOS and Mac counterparts, letting users make playlists, create music libraries, and listen to Beats 1 radio. The TV will also have its own App Store, where users can find versions of iTunes TV, iTunes Movies, and Apple Music, all designed specifically for the Apple TV. In addition to Apple TV standards like Netflix, Hulu, and HBO, the new TV will also include games like Disney Infinity and Guitar Hero, a Major League Baseball streaming app that lets users watch two games at once, and apps for AirBnB and Zillow, if you really want to hunt for an apartment through your television. A Gilt app will let users shop directly from the comfort of their couches, fulfilling the dreams of many 1960s futurists. A developer beta of the new tvOS will also let developers create their own apps for the TV.   Today’s event was always about introducing new iPhones, and Apple didn’t disappoint. The new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus will be built from a new, custom aluminium alloy, and will be available in silver, gold, space grey, and rose gold. As expected, they will have Force Touch, which can detect where you’re pressing on the screen and how hard. The 6S will have the same 4.7 inch display screen as the iPhone 6, and the 6S Plus will retain its 5.5 inch screen. But both will come with new glass displays built of Ion-X, the same display on the Apple Watch Sport. The upgraded iPhones both have a new A9 chip built in, 70 percent faster than the A8 at CPU tasks, and 90 percent faster with graphics. You’ll also see a new 12-megapixel rear iSight camera, capable of shooting video in 4K, and a 5 megapixel front-facing camera with Retina Flash that’s supposedly 3x brighter than regular flash. But despite all the new storage-heavy features, entry-level iPhones will still start at 16GB. Apple is also maintaining its traditional pricing tiers: $199 to $399 for the 6S, and $299 to $499 for the 6S Plus depending on storage, while on a two-year contract. For those who don’t want to be tied to a contract, Apple is also introducing two new payment options. You can either pay for the 6S in installments of $27 per month, or lease an iPhone for $32 per month, which lets you trade in your phone for a new one every year. Preorders for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus start September 12th, and general availability will follow on September 25th. The latest version of iOS, however, is coming sooner than that: iOS 9 will be released in a little under a week, on September 16th. As expected, Apple brought 3D Touch to the new iPhones today. The feature is similar to the Watch’s simpler Force Touch, which allows users to clear all notifications with one press. 3D Touch, however, means the iPhone screen can distinguish between multiple levels of pressure. 3D Touch will require users to learn at least two new gestures: ""peek"" and ""pop,"" which will make app browsing more direct. ""Peek"" will let users preview information, and ""Pop"" will take them inside it. The hope is that 3D Touch will let iPhone users dip in and out of different apps without losing their place or forgetting what they were originally doing. In the Mail app, a light touch will let users preview an email, and a stronger press will let them read it. WeChat, Instagram, and Facebook are among the third-party apps set to integrate 3D Touch into their functions. Apple is making iPhone images a little more dynamic with the introduction of a new feature called Live Photos. Before and after the camera shutter closes, Live Photos will capture a second and a half of footage, so when you view the image later it plays like a short video clip. HTC tried this with its Zoe feature on the M7 a few years back, but Apple says users will be able to post Live Photos to Facebook. Live Photos will be supported across all Apple products. The Apple Watch got slightly more useful and better-looking today with the announcement of several new apps and bands. The most notable new bands were designed by luxury brand Hermès, whose three custom brown leather straps include a double-wrapped band that fits with a custom, slightly elongated watch face. Also announced were several new pastel-colored bands for the Apple Watch Sport, and a red band created in collaboration with Bono’s HIV/AIDS charity Product Red. The aluminum Sport will be offered in gold, rose gold, and anodized aluminum finishes. New native apps for the Watch include Facebook Messenger and GoPro, plus a medical app called Airstrip that lets users measure their vitals in real time. And the Watch’s latest operating software, Watch OS 2, will launch on September 16th. Today’s Apple event neatly wrapped up a lot of loose ends — we finally have the upgraded Apple TV that we’ve been expecting since 2011, the new iPhones came with the requisite spec updates and some cool new features, and if you’ve been dreaming of a gigantic iPad, well you’ve got that too. We’re still waiting for iOS 9 and Watch OS 2, both of which are slated to be released on September 16th, but if you’re waiting to upgrade your Mac to El Capitan, you’re going to have to hold on until September 30th. Oh, and if you heard some rumors about a big-name musical guest possibly releasing a new album around the event? That didn't happen. The only musical appearance was by One Republic, which used the event to apologize for getting so much play at Whole Foods stores.

About 55 million people in the US benefit from Medicare About 55 million people in the US benefit from Medicare. Prior to this measure, physicians could only be paid by Medicare for an end-of-life care consultation if that consultation took place during an annual visit. But the new policy changes that by creating a new Medicare benefit that will include payment to doctors. And of course, going through this type of counseling will be entirely voluntary. As the US population grows older, some states have passed laws that make it easier to include end-of-life decisions in medical records, according to Politico. And some state Medicaid programs already cover these types of discussions. But Palin's 2009 suggestion that end-of-life discussions were comparable to setting up ""death panels"" is widely thought to have derailed this measure when it was introduced under the Affordable Care Act. Medicare tends to set the tone for private insurers, so it's possible that some companies will follow suit and start covering these discussions as well. That said, the measure will probably spark another ""death panel"" debate. There's some precedent for it, after all.

The discovery could help couples struggling to conceive to spend less time and money on fertility treatments that don’t work. In a new study published today in Science Translational Medicine, researchers detail how sequencing genetic information in sperm can show whether a man is infertile. The scientists looked at the sperm’s RNA, a cornerstone in any cell — it helps cells to ""read"" DNA, and it plays a role in regulating genes’ activities. Men who are missing certain RNA sequences from their semen have a much lower likelihood of conceiving than men whose sperm contain these sequences. The findings suggest that sperm RNA could serve as a fingerprint for male fertility. Sperm RNA could serve as a fingerprint for male fertility Around 12 percent of couples are infertile, and in about 40 percent of these cases, the male partner is either the sole cause or partially contributing, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Fertility treatments are often expensive; the average price of in vitro fertilization hovers around $12,400. If clinics could tell patients whether they should save their money — or go directly to high-cost interventions, skipping the cheaper ones that won’t work — that may be reason enough to justify RNA sequencing of sperm. Current methods for diagnosing male infertility involve looking at the shape, number, and movement of a man’s sperm. But sometimes this isn’t enough to tell which men are infertile; in many cases, there’s no obvious reason that a man should have difficulty with fertility, a condition known as idiopathic infertility. ""It’s difficult to say why they pass all the fertility tests, and we can’t ascertain the underlying cause of the infertility,"" study author Stephen Krawetz, a professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, tells The Verge. ""Current methods don’t really provide great information on the chance of natural pregnancy or what may be causing abnormal sperm production,"" says Peter Schlegel, a professor of urology at Cornell University who was not involved with this study. ""There certainly is a potential need for this method.""   Sperm harbors a rich population of RNA (C. Bickel/Science Translational Medicine)  Krawetz has long suspected that sperm RNA might play a role in infertility. Researchers have known that sperm contains important DNA, which carries essential genetic information. But around 20 years ago, Krawetz and his research team discovered that sperm also house RNA — but its exact function within sperm remains unknown. It’s possible this RNA is passed onto the egg during fertilization, but scientists also suspect it plays a role in the development and production of sperm. Since this discovery, researchers have been working to determine how sperm microRNA may be related to a man’s fecundity. Scientists identified 648 sperm RNA elements linked with male fertility So Krawetz and his team collected sperm from 96 men who were receiving different types of treatments at a fertility clinic. Some of these men did not actually have infertility and were able to conceive with their partners after adjusting the timing of their intercourse. This group served as the control group, in contrast to the men who still struggled to conceive despite minimal intervention. The scientists sequenced the RNA of both groups’ sperm. That let scientists identify 648 sperm RNA elements —  known as exons — linked with male fertility. Men in the group who had trouble conceiving all had at least one of these RNA sequences missing in their sperm. Men who lacked more than one of the sequences had a 27 percent chance of conceiving naturally compared to a 73 percent chance among those in the control group. What’s more, these RNA elements correspond to genes that matter for sperm development, movement fertilization and other key functions. Krawetz suggests that sperm RNA could help to chart the course of treatment for couples hoping to conceive. Along with examining sperm shape and size, fertility clinics could also look to see if these 648 RNA elements are present in the semen. ""If they are present, that would suggest they could use a minimal intervention treatment that would lead to a successful pregnancy,"" says Krawetz. ""If they’re not present, that would suggest they should immediately proceed to assistive reproductive technology. It gives us more of a rationale for making a decision."" ""We still need a clear understanding of what the critical RNAs are and how they interact with the causes of male infertility,"" he says. This study is only the beginning, cautions Cornell’s Schlegel. ""We still need a clear understanding of what the critical RNAs are and how they interact with the causes of male infertility, but they’re clearly an important component of sperm development."" Krawetz says the benefits of this study may extend beyond just aiding infertility diagnoses, though. Since sperm RNA correspond to genes in a child’s genome, the researchers may be able to study these sequences to see if any are linked with potential genetic disorders. But until then Krawetz says the main goal is to automate RNA sequencing of sperm so that it can be a routine procedure for men. Otherwise, the value of this research holds little real world benefit.",0.5449540795203075,0.4550459204796925,0.8963724470442562,881,5.2077185017026109,425,6.4447058823529408,0,2,"Science, Report"

Across North America and Europe, species that live in the South are dying off, whereas bumblebees that reside in the North are failing to migrate to cooler areas, according to a study published today in Science. This means that bumblebee populations are now highly compressed — leaving a void that other wild bee species probably won't be able to fill. Bumblebees are among the only bees that can pollinate flowers throughout most of the year. ""These species are at serious and immediate risk."" ""These species are at serious and immediate risk from rapid, human-induced climate change,"" says Jeremy Kerr, an ecologist at the University of Ottawa in Canada and one of the co-authors of the study. ""They just aren’t colonizing new areas and establishing new populations fast enough.""   Credit: Melissa Tonge Bumblebees didn't evolve in the tropics; they actually originated about 5 to 10 million years ago in cool-to-temperate regions of the world, which means that they tend to like a cooler environment. And that's great for humans because, unlike other wild bees, they can pollinate flowers from late April through October. Tomatoes, strawberries and sweet peppers are among the plants that benefit from their particular form of pollination. Unfortunately, their evolutionary history is probably the source of their inability to adapt to warmer temperatures — an entirely different problem from ""colony collapse disorder,"" which only affects honey bees. Bumblebees originate from cool regions of the world The researchers looked at bumblebee data that date all the way back to 1901. ""We wanted to know if species' northern and southern range limits had shifted through time,"" says Paul Galpern, a landscape ecologist at the University of Calgary and one of the co-authors of the study. To do that, the researchers used observations of 420,000 bee specimens across North America and Europe — in addition to gathering data about temperature, habitat loss, and pesticide use. The researchers found that the disappearance of bumblebee populations from hotter and southern regions around the world can be linked to rising temperatures. ""Bumblebees have retreated by nearly 300 kilometers, or about 190 miles,"" in the southernmost areas, Kerr says. ""This is a huge loss and it happened very quickly, nearly 5 kilometers per year in southern areas.""  Credit: York University These departures are probably the result of a mass die-off, rather than northern migrations, the researchers suggest. Scientists have observed in other research that rapid warming — particularly the impact of extreme weather events — causes bumblebees to go locally extinct, Kerr says. And it's those local extinctions that are likely leading to a large-scale decline. ""Bumblebee species are generally failing to take advantage of warming conditions to colonize new areas,"" Kerr says. And ""we're simply losing the Southern populations."" Bumblebees in the North aren't doing much better. Despite rising temperatures that should have allowed them to move northward, they haven't budged. Instead, some species are moving uphill — a coping mechanism that won't do them much good when they run out of flowery hillsides. Thus, climate change has shrunk the amount of land that bumblebees use, and humans are paying the price. Bumblebees are ""failing to take advantage of warming conditions."" If bumblebees can't pollinate crops, food prices will rise and some crops will become harder to grow successfully, or plentifully. And these impacts are large and immediate, Kerr says. This isn't something that we should start to worry about ""at some vague, future time."" ""The results aren't entirely surprising — we know that bumblebees thrive in cool climates so we'd expect them to be impacted by climate change,"" says Dave Goulson, a biologist at the University of Sussex who didn't participate in the study. ""But nonetheless this is the first clear evidence that this is happening across many species and across huge geographic scales."" ""First clear evidence that this is happening across many species."" The researchers weren't able to ""detectably link"" other factors, like human land use and pesticide use, to global bee decline, Kerr explains. ""We know that such factors can seriously harm pollinator species — there is no doubt about that — but those factors appear to be unrelated to changes along the margins of species ranges in Europe or in North America."" The scientists don't know why bumblebees have been unable to migrate north. It's possible that this has something to do bumblebees' capacity to grow their populations quickly when they arrive in a new location. Bumblebees are generally pretty good at getting around, but for some reason they might not be able to sustain significant growth in new, cooler areas. Of course, it's also possible that the global temperature increase that the planet has experienced so far isn't large enough to make them move, says Sydney Cameron, an entomologist at the University of Illinois who didn't take part in the study. ""It's way too early to say they won't move in the future just because they haven't yet moved."" But if that's not the case, then humans may have to act. Already, researchers are thinking of ways to help bumblebee populations move northward. One possible solution is ""assisted migration,"" a practice that would involve moving various species northward and helping them get established. Bumblebees ""may need human intervention to help them establish new populations."" ""Just as human activities cause climate change today, bumblebee species may need human intervention to help them establish new populations in cooler and more northerly environments,"" Kerr says. That said, scientists shouldn't start moving bumblebees north without thinking about how this might impact species that are already in those areas, he says. Humans could cause a lot of damage if bumblebees start competing with other, equally useful animals. In addition, some bumblebee species — like Europe's buff-tailed bumblebee — are doing pretty well, so moving them wouldn't do much good. ""Big global patterns are a step,"" Cameron says, but scientists need to understand the details, too. For now, gardeners can help bumblebees by adding wild flowers to their yards, the researchers say. But planting wild flowers might not be enough in the long term. Bumblebees are already battling habitat loss and pesticide use — factors that may place an eventual comeback out of reach. ""It's likely that the combined stresses from all of these pressures will have devastating impacts on bumblebees in the not-too-distant future,"" Goulson says. ""Climate change is beginning to take a toll"": a thought that Goulson describes as ""depressing.""",0.7199076569231546,0.2800923430768454,0.8180266195910866,1093,5.3330283623055807,531,6.3634651600753296,1,2,"Science, US & World, Report"

Comb jellies, as their name indicates, are soft — which is why this new discovery is so intriguing.      Modern comb jelly. Credit: Marsh Youngbluth/Wikimedia Commons In the study, the researchers looked at six new fossils from the Cambrian Period, which ended about 485 million years ago. They found that the comb jellies had eight rigid plates surrounding their apical sensory organ, which they used as a gravitational receptor. They also lacked tentacles, sporting eight radiating spoke-like structures instead that probably supported the soft-bodied flaps of the main portion of their bodies. ""One of the species even had robust spines."" The spokes and plates may not have been used exclusively for mechanical support, however. The researchers think these hard parts might have served as a defense mechanism against predators, or as protection from difficult environmental conditions. ""One of the species even had robust spines"" that retained their structural integrity when separated at the joints, says Quiang Ou, a paleobiologist at the China University of Geosciences and a co-author of the study.   Ancient comb jelly fossils. Credit: Dr. Qiang Ou and his colleagues These defense mechanisms didn't make it into modern comb jellies, however. This suggests that they may have been part of ""unsuccessful evolutionary experiment"" during the Cambrian explosion, Ou says. ""This major [animal] branch might have struggled a strenuous life."" And eventually, they went extinct. Overall, the findings show that the earliest ctenophores were tentacle-less, despite DNA analyses that suggested that the opposite was true. But the study also hints at something larger. If ancient comb jellies had to develop these skeleton-like parts, it's likely that they faced a whole bunch of ecological challenges in their time — challenges that led them to develop a feature that wasn't conserved over evolutionary time. Ou calls this an ""arms race"" — one that ancient comb jellies apparently lost.",0.4558387869813042,0.5441612130186958,0.8401804099789031,479,5.3903966597077249,286,6.3636363636363633,0,4,Science

Both capsules will be able to carry a crew of seven, with their first flights slated for 2017. The Dragon will launch on top of SpaceX's Falcon rocket, and the CST-100 will initially launch on top of ULA's Atlas V rocket, though it will be compatible with multiple rocket types.  Since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, NASA has been reliant on the Russian Soyuz rocket to transport the space agency's astronauts to the ISS. The option is both expensive and not exactly ideal. Sending a single NASA astronaut on the Soyuz costs the agency upwards of $70 million, and relations between the United States and Russia have been strained since the Ukraine crisis. The Commercial Crew Program is NASA's way of getting American astronauts back on American rockets for a lower rate.

They like to sleep inside a plant called Nepenthes hemsleyana  — a carnivorous plant that feeds on bat poop. It's one of nature's amazing reciprocal relationships that work out really well, even if it sounds downright weird. But there is one issue with this arrangement: these plants can be hard to find. Fortunately, the shape of their ""pitchers"" — the part that can be used to catch insects and, err, house a sleeping bat — are ideal for reflecting sound, according to a study published today in Current Biology. This means that bats can ""spot them"" using echolocation after a tiring night of flying around. The plants are giving a ""'shout back' to the bats to come on over."" ""We mostly think about plant signaling as targeting sight and smell, but here these plants are not so much giving a 'shout out' but a 'shout back' to the bats to come on over,"" explains Rohan Clarke, an ecologist at Monash University in Australia who didn't take part in the work. To attract insects, Nepenthes hemsleyana use pitchers filled with a digestive fluid — which might be bad for those slumbering bats, right? Not quite. As it turns out, these plants have an uncommon shape that allows the bats to ""stick inside the pitchers like a cork on a bottle,"" says Michael Schoner, a bat ecologist at the University of Greifswald and a co-author of the study. And only the bottom part of the pitchers are filled with fluid, so the bats never come in contact with it. Bat poop, however, reaches the digestive fluid just fine — which is good because these plants are kind of bad at catching insects. ""It's a very poor insect trap,"" Michael Schoner says. ""It captures seven times less insects than its closest relative."" This means that allowing bats to find pitchers to sleep in is pretty important for the plant's survival. And that's where the plant's shape comes in.   Credit: Ch'ien C. Lee To find out if the pitcher's shape could serve as an effective ""acoustic reflector,"" the researchers used a sonar device that they placed at different angles away from individual N. hemsleyana plants and its closest relative, Nepenthes rafflesiana — a plant that doesn't host bats. They measured both species' ability to return sound to their source. The researchers found that N. hemsleyana was able to produce a very loud reflector echo, and that the directional information contained in that echo was specific to that plant species. Those two features should help the plants stand out, acoustically, in cluttered surroundings, the researchers suggest. The plants are bad at catching insects, so they ""eat"" a lot of bat poop  Still, the scientists needed to know if the bats' echolocation calls were suited to the pitchers. Hardwicke's woolly bats are known for producing short, high-pitched calls, so the researchers recorded the last five calls produced by a handful of bats as they approached the pitchers. By analyzing these recordings, the scientists found that calls were ideal for localizing and classifying the vegetation that surrounds the bats. And incidentally, the researchers think that these bats produced the ""highest frequencies ever recorded in bats"" — with starting frequencies of up to 292 kHZ. Armed with this information, the scientists then tried to test how good these carnivorous plants are at attracting bats. In this experiment, the researchers enlarged the pitchers of certain plants, removed them, or left them intact. Then, they recorded the time it took bats to find hidden plants. The bats needed a lot less time to find enlarged and intact pitchers  The scientists found that the bats needed a lot less time to find enlarged and intact pitchers compared with plants devoid of pitchers. And when it came time to choose a plant to actually sleep in, the bats chose to enter unmodified pitchers more often than plants with removed or enlarged pitchers. So, although the bats seem attracted to enlarged reflectors, they don't seem to identify them as N. hemslayana when it's time to nap — a decision that may be related to the acoustic cues they're getting from the carnivorous plants. The study provides ""strong evidence"" that the bats use the ultrasound reflection ""signature"" of their plants to find the roosts and to distinguish them from pitchers of other species, says Ulrike Bauer, an ecologist who specializes in plant-insect interactions at the University of Bristol and who didn't take part in the study. Humans tend to underestimate the powers of plants because they are so different from us — animals are much easier to grasp, she says. ""But plants have just as many amazing tricks up their sleeves as animals."" Clarke agrees, adding that he thinks the findings are especially noteworthy because plant-bat relationships that include sound reflectance are ""relatively rare."" And so far, these relationships have only been found in the neotropics, in situations where bats pollinate flowers — instead of situations where they defecate in them. Humans tend to underestimate the powers of plants  The researchers don't know if the plant's shape is an adaptation developed specifically to help bats locate them. ""We assume that it's the case,"" says Caroline Schoner, a bat ecologist also at the University of Greifswald and a co-author of the study. ""But at the moment we cannot prove exactly that it's really developed for the bats."" Still, the fact that none of the 300 to 500 other pitcher plants have this shape, or this relationship with bats ""gives us some clue,"" Michael Schoner says. The Schoners, who are married, plan to tackle this question next. The study highlights the importance of peat swamp forest environments in Southeast Asia, Caroline Schoner says. The bats rely pretty heavily on these plants, so if humans damage these forests, they will affect the bats, too. ""The study shows how connected the different organisms are,"" she says. ""If you take one out, then the whole ecosystem is in danger, because there are so many other species that rely on this one organism."" But beyond the conservation factors lies the ""this is totally awesome"" line of thinking. When researchers discovered that some plants consume animals for nutritional purposes, that was considered pretty novel. Then, a few years ago, scientists realized that bats gain a safe roost site in return for their droppings, which enhance plant nutrition in these same carnivorous plants, Clarke says. ""Now, we've learned that these plants are acoustically attractive to the bats,"" he says — a finding that shows, once again, ""just how complex the natural world can be.""",0.6004294866830633,0.3995705133169367,0.6434517804588742,1132,4.9823321554770317,513,6.1520467836257309,0,2,"Science, Report"

The satellites could launch as early as 2018, forming OneWeb’s constellation that will provide LTE, 3G, and Wi-Fi to rural communities across the globe.  The Airbus announcement, however, is seemingly more than just a way for the company to capitalize on the competitive field of providing internet from space; the move appears to be yet another attempt by Airbus to compete with SpaceX, which is often regarded as the leading innovator and cost saver in the private sector. The spaceflight juggernaut is also charging ahead with its plan of enveloping the world in internet access from space — a goal CEO Elon Musk first trumpeted in January. And just last week, SpaceX requested permission from the FCC to begin testing the special antenna technology on its satellites that will deliver high-speed internet to the ground. According to Musk, a total of 4,000 satellites will be used to create the company’s internet infrastructure in lower Earth orbit. Yet another attempt to compete with SpaceX Musk hasn’t given any indication, however, of when we can expect to see his satellites up and running, so the announcement from Airbus adds some heat to the internet space race. According to Airbus, its satellites will weigh less than 330 pounds each; the plan is to send 700 of the micro-satellites up into lower Earth orbit by 2018, while the other 200 will stay on the ground and serve as replacements if necessary. Since OneWeb is receiving funding from Virgin Galactic, the satellites are expected to go up on Launcher One (that is, if the rocket stays on schedule for its planned 2016 launch). OneWeb says that when operational, the entire constellation will provide a data transfer rate of 10 terabits per second to rural communities. This is the second recent announcement from Airbus that seems to pose a direct challenge to SpaceX. Last week at the Paris Air Show, Airbus revealed that it has been secretly working on a partially reusable rocket design for the past five years. Dubbed Adeline, the concept is meant to offer a cheaper alternative to SpaceX’s (soon to be) reusable Falcon 9 rocket, although Airbus has yet to move the project beyond prototype phase. Meanwhile, the quest to create a comprehensive internet service from space has been eyed hungrily by many these past few years, with various tech companies hoping to be the first to make it happen. Along with Musk and Branson, Google is also working on a vast infrastructure of weather balloons that will provide internet service from the stratosphere.

Two independent companies have now launched projects to build versions of the high-speed transportation system, drawing from Musk's open-source plans. And yesterday, Musk's own SpaceX announced it was building a test track that will host a ""pod racing competition"" in which groups will compete to design the most aerodynamic crafts. After a spectacularly unconventional development, the idea is closer to reality than it's ever been. It's good news, real progress on an exciting idea. Even a 5-mile Hyperloop represents a significant challenge, and settling on a craft design will be an important part of any system. But by tackling these problems, the teams are side-stepping the Hyperloop’s harder problems and avoiding the technology’s most central questions. If you’re wondering how fast the hyperloop can go or how safe it will be at high speeds, a capsule design competition won’t do you much good, and a 5-mile test track will only give you the slightest glimpse of the important challenges ahead. As a result, what looks like a step forward may be more like a holding pattern. Deployment details are life-or-death issues for the Hyperloop The biggest issues are speed and scale. The Hyperloop was pitched as faster and cheaper than alternatives like cars and trains, but even small shifts in those numbers can dramatically change how it stacks up. It's easy to imagine safety concerns limiting Hyperloop speeds to just a fraction of its theoretical top speed or right-of-way issues keeping stations far from urban centers. Would we still be excited about the Hyperloop if a 30-minute trek became a three-hour one? What if it cost $60 billion instead the promised $6 billion? After enough setbacks, it might not be worth developing the technology at all. Those deployment details are life-or-death issues for the Hyperloop, but as long as the tests are focused on small-scale loops, it's not clear we'll ever get answers to them. SpaceX's latest round of tests doesn't seem likely to change that. The test track is only 5 miles, nowhere near the distance it would take to reach 700 miles per hour. Another test track built by Hyperloop Test Technologies will have the same problem, aiming at a 200mph top speed. For the same reason, these test tracks can’t address the unique safety issues that come with near-supersonic travel. The result is just a tube-powered version of conventional transportation tech like maglev and rail. That doesn't mean that useful work can't be done on this round of test tracks, but it means the central question of the Hyperloop — whether it will be fast and cost-effective enough to replace airplanes and conventional rail at scale — is going to remain unanswered. In part, the problem is how well Musk has sold the Hyperloop. What exists now — what we're talking about when we say ""Hyperloop"" — is basically just a technical sketch. Put together a lightweight pod with air rails and an enclosed maglev tube, and that's a Hyperloop. We're still feeling out the engineering challenges involved in combining those technologies and the limitations that pop up along the way. We can make estimates about how fast it could travel and how much power it might use, but they're still just guesses, and it's hard to know how they'll survive the rocky transition from the drafting table to the real world. Would we still be excited about the Hyperloop if a 30-minute trek became a three-hour one? It’s common for a technology to fall short of its initial hype once logistical realities set in — but the Hyperloop started with an extraordinary amount of hype. When Musk first announced the plans, he said a working hyperloop could travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco in 30 minutes, many times faster than any conventional mode of transport, all at a fraction of the traditional price. Those numbers were the source of the excitement, and we still don’t know how plausible they are. If the Hyperloop is running on anything but a perfectly straight track, then its speed will likely be determined by the sharpness of the curves, not the power of the accelerator. It's also unclear what it would be like to maintain a Hyperloop, which elements will break down, and how often. Safety equipment, particularly earthquake safety, would raise costs and friction even further. Closing that gap has been particularly difficult because of the unusual development of the Hyperloop. Since the beginning, Musk has taken an impassive approach to the project, first open-sourcing the design with no plans to deploy it, now challenging other groups to build human-scale pods to his specifications. The open-source nature of the challenge is usually read as magnanimity, putting aside the profit motive to share his idea with the world, but it could just as easily be seen as caution. If the Hyperloop is a cool idea that's impossible to deploy, the caution makes perfect sense. Even now, we've seen three companies take up the idea (counting the current SpaceX challenge) and no plausible plans to realize the LA to San Francisco route Musk initially envisioned. Even after testing, the route may simply be unworkable at the speeds Musk first proposed. It wouldn’t be the first technology to fail to make the leap. Monorails, maglev, and other high-speed rail systems started out as promising, only to be whittled down by some of the same right-of-way and top-speed challenges now faced by the Hyperloop. Musk may well succeed where those projects failed, but until we start to address the big questions, it’s still just a good idea. That's not to say the Hyperloop will turn into a boondoggle, or that the latest round of testing won't be successful. It really is a promising idea, and more research is always a good thing — but the road to a fully functional Hyperloop isn’t getting any shorter.",0.5172732758553469,0.4827267241446531,0.16072528426264357,991,5.0060544904137236,512,6.236328125,0,0,"Transportation, Editorial"

The theme that was set for this task was simply ""the sea,"" which has been represented by Snøhetta in the form of highly pixelated coastal landscapes. One of the interesting themes that runs through the design is how the wind of the sea intensifies in sync with the value of the note, resulting in square, static blocks on the 50 kroner note and elongated strips of color on the 1,000 kroner note. It's an unashamedly modern style that the designers intentionally built around pixels in the belief that they are ""our time's visual language.""    The Metric System takes a more literal approach by just presenting beautiful drawings of ships, fish, a lighthouse, and a family by the sea, providing a neat juxtaposition with Snøhetta's abstractions. What's more, says Norges Bank, the more classic design on the front is better suited to integrating the necessary security components without making them obtrusive. So it seems like the perfect marriage between abstract and realistic, young motifs and old. The winning submissions from Snøhetta and The Metric System form the basis for the final design of Norway's 2017 release of new banknotes.

The path, called the Thames Deckway, would run east-west along the river’s southern bank for about seven miles, from Battersea to Canary Wharf. ""London needs to think outside the box of conventional solutions to solve its deep-seated traffic and pollution problems, the River Cycleway Consortium said in a statement announcing the proposal. ""The river Thames, London’s main transportation thoroughfare from Roman times up to the 19th century, is overlooked today as a major travel artery except for a handful of passenger boats."" The route will float with the tides Designers will have to find a way around moorings, Cycling Weekly points out, including the HMS Belfast, a battleship-turned-museum. Storms and waves would also be an issue. The route will float with the tides, and satellites and on-board sensors will monitor inclement weather and notify riders. According to the consortium, the path will generate its own energy through a combination of solar, tidal, and wind power. The biggest obstacle, however, is likely the cost: 600 million pounds, or $960 million. London has been trying to encourage cycling as a way of relieving traffic congestion for several years. Last month, Mayor Boris Johnson, a famously enthusiastic cyclist, announced a plan for an 18-mile protected east-west bike lane, due to open in March 2016.

If Windows 7 was everyone’s idea, Windows 10 appears to be his. Machalani’s concepts centered around a method of easing the jarring switching between desktop and ""Metro."" He even produced a prototype of a way to switch between the ""Metro"" part of Windows 8 and a traditional Start menu on a hybrid device like the Surface.

""All of the classics,"" he says. His personal site even includes a large list of his inspirations. His initial goal was to work in animation, but when he discovered computers, and their potential to ""help me create whatever I wanted,"" he decided video games might be a better place for his talents. Prior to working at Ubisoft he freelanced for the likes of Magic the Gathering creator Wizards of the Coast, but video games let him ""create more living worlds,"" he explains. Outside of his day job, Blanche is currently working on a personal project called ""Stardust."" He calls it something he ""had in the back of my mind"" for ages, but what it is isn't exactly clear. Right now ""Stardust"" is a Tumblr filled with beautiful art: colorful illustrations of ships flying through a hazy space, and towering, Death Star-like structures floating among the stars.

This has led her to create incredible posters for games like Enemy Starfighter and films like Lolita, and she even made a fantastic piece for the 1982 classic Pitfall, channelling the wonder of the iconic cover artists of the Atari era. Sometimes these pieces are commissioned by clients, other times she simply makes fan art for a movie or game she's excited about. Sometimes it's both.

With the new design, you'll be able to walk the entire length of the train, which frees up lots of space that was wasted just from closing off individual cars in the past. The entrances are now all evenly spaced and feature double-wide doors, which means it should be a lot faster to get on and off the trains. And you won't have to ""mind the gap"" anymore: the cars are all shorter, which makes the trains more flexible and able to come much closer to the platform edge. There are smaller improvements, too, like strips of LED lights along the doors that clearly flash red to warn passengers as they're about to close. In addition, all of the advertising and signage on the cars will use digital screens instead of paper inserts, and some of the deepest lines in London will get air conditioning for the first time with the new cars. And did we mention that there will be Wi-Fi on board? Perhaps most importantly, the new trains will be future proofed to run entirely operator-free (though they'll be staffed for the foreseeable future).  The improvements are certainly good news for London residents, but when it comes down to it, the new trains just look like they belong in the future.

The company worked with musicians like Blood Orange's Dev Hynes, Best Coast, and Danny Brown as well as art collectives like The Principals, Big Noble, and Perfect Fools to set up a week-long experience full of interactive installations. Throughout the residency, which ends on October 5th, Sonos will be hosting bevy of performances and Q&A sessions  alongside the installations, and while the RSVP lists for the events are already full, Sonos gave us a look at everything they've set up.  The first installation on the main floor of NeueHouse combines a 15-minute piece of music made by Hynes with two rows of motor-driven reflective mylar (created by The Principals) that hang from the ceiling. The mylar reacts directly to the beats of the music, and one section in the back is hooked up to a microphone that lets visitors interact with the piece themselves by making their own noise. Downstairs are workstations for building speakers using Sonos components and AutoDesk, along with a microphone and MakerBot printer dedicated to printing a 3D waveform of your voice. Next to that was another impressive multimedia installation, something the Swedish creative agency Perfect Fools and the artists of Big Noble created with Sonos called ""Sounds of New York City."" Internal LEDs turn a wall of 300 Sonos Play:1 speakers into a display that features animations of people walking or trains moving mapped to corresponding sounds recorded by the collaborators. The most striking mode displays a colorful view of the five boroughs that — via a Microsoft Kinect — lets users wave their hands to select spots on the map that trigger songs from hometown artists (Jay-Z's ""Empire State of Mind,"" for example). Each speaker is fastened to a motor that drives it toward or away from whoever is interacting with it, adding three-dimensional life to the rig. Brad Wolf, the Senior Director of Brand Innovation at Sonos, sees events like these as a proving ground for the ideas that his department comes up with. ""We might move it to LA and have a ‘Sounds of LA’,"" he said of the speaker installation. ""You might see it in retail, you might see it in an event with an artist, but first we’re trying to see how this 1.0 works out.""  His caution was prescient, as the complicated setup gave the on-site team trouble, and at one point needed to be completely reset. But the problem was a mundane one that most of us can relate to: one mistakenly disconnected plug. Wolf laughed it off. ""This is what you get when you try something really hard."" As the crews from Big Noble and Perfect Fools worked on restarting their creation, Wolf smiled in the glow of the red error-message light coming from the speakers as he repeated himself. ""It'll come alive. It'll come alive."" The Principals built the installation so that the audio signal from Dev Hynes' music also splits from a Sonos Connect unit into a spectrum analyzer which splits the sound into five different frequencies. Each frequency is mapped to a different motor above a particular section of mylar, creating a pulsing effect that reacts to the different parts of the song.  Sonos Play:1's were also stationed underneath the installation and played Hynes' 15-minute composition on a loop. The custom rig built by The Principals worked alongside Sonos Connect units to power the installation. The quilt-like installation hangs above this workspace on the main floor of NeueHouse, and at the top of the stairs an ambient microphone lets visitors interact with their own section of the mylar. During the week, Hynes will actually perform his composition live an let the installation react to the performance. The installation is made out of silver-coated mylar, a surface that is so reflective that the members of The Principals who built it had to use gloves so they could keep it all from smudging. ""It almost isn't there, it picks up everything around it, and it's so pliable that it's fluid like water,"" Drew Seskunas of The Principals told me. Downstairs at NeueHouse is where the more hands-on features are found, like the station where you can build your own speaker from Sonos components. From hot glue to wiring, the build-your-own speaker station is stocked with all the tools needed for assembly, along with experts who help you learn how to do it yourself. Visitors are able to record a short phrase into this microphone and the waveform of the audio gets 3D-printed in the adjacent MakerBot printer. Shown here is one of many waveforms printed throughout the day. The phrases had to be short, so many people went with options like their own name, or quotes like ""Don't worry, be happy.""  The workers on hand could also print out waveforms as decoration for the build-your-own-speaker section. The Kinect unit that sat atop the ""Sounds of New York City"" installation tracks hand movement, and lets users select songs by waving a hand in front of specifically colored speakers. The entire basement level was split into sections. ""Make"" for the hands-on stations, ""Play"" for where the speaker wall was set up, and ""Listen"" for the space where performances will be held all week. The retail versions of Sonos Play:1 speakers don't light up, but Sonos Brand Innovation Director Brad Wolf didn't rule out the possibility of it happening in the future. “We’re looking at that type of thing, how much we vary our speaker designs. If people really respond to this really well, I think it could have a place.”",0.849370883151423,0.15062911684857705,0.6727577306075907,969,4.9040247678018574,484,6.1033057851239674,0,26,"Culture, Design, Photo Essay"

The South Korean firm is beginning construction on a new manufacturing complex to supply the essential components to the electronics industry, investing 15.6 trillion won ($14.3 billion) in a site the size of 400 soccer fields. The complex — which is almost as big as the company's two largest semiconductor factories put together — is slated to begin production in 2017, and will further consolidate Samsung's position in the industry. As engineers have continued to push the limits of chip design (straining Moore's Law in the process) and companies have driven down prices by scaling up production, the cost of entry for building semiconductors has escalated. Unlike the smartphone industry, where companies like Huawei and Xiaomi have been able to undermine Samsung by operating at razor-thin profit margins, this isn't a business that's open to newcomers. Samsung's decision to build a new facility, first reported by ET News and confirmed by The Verge, will only exacerbate this trend, locking out would-be competitors.

Although Samsung remains the world's biggest smartphone manufacturer in terms of volume, its semiconductor business is also the world's second largest after Intel.

For 12 rounds Pretty Boy Floyd dodged, rolled, and hugged his way to a unanimous decision. Hungry for some conflict, the media latched onto an unfortunate quip from Dick Costolo, the CEO of Twitter. And the winner is... @periscopeco  Costolo would later clarify that he was talking about live streams from backstage that had taken place before and after the fight, giving users an intimate glimpse at the boxers out of the ring. HBO was the one using Periscope in that case. But most people assumed he was referring to the numerous illegal live streams of the match which popped up on Periscope, and its rival Meerkat, allowing anyone to catch the action while avoiding the $99 pay-per-view price tag. The hot takes flew fast and furious from media and tech reporters. Hollywood and Twitter were at each others throats! Periscope and piracy had dealt a body blow to pay-per-view! Finally, a fight where some blood would get spilled, at least metaphorically. You got the sense from the press that more people saw the action on illegal smartphone streams than on cable TV. The reality, however, like the boxing match, doesn’t live up to the hype.     Periscope said it received a total of 66 takedown notices during the action. It shut down about half of those, and the other half had already ended. A spokesperson said the company was able to respond to every takedown notice within minutes. Meerkat said it got a total of about 100 takedown requests. Periscope CEO Kayvon Beykpour joked on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt this week that there were more articles written about the problem than actual pirate streams, and at this point it looks like he was actually right. Still, the larger question of live streaming as an existential threat to television’s paywall remains. There have always been illegal live streams of popular sporting events available on the web, but those took effort to set up and find. Pirate sites either cost money or greeted you with the worst kind of pop-up ads and malware. Periscope and Meerkat have lowered the barrier to entry, so that amateurs with no profit motive are now broadcasting just for kicks. It’s sort of like the jump from professional bootleggers trafficking tracks on Warez forums to the peer-to-peer network of Napster. In the Periscope app description they might as well include ""Free Pay Per View... without all the annoying pop-ups and viruses!""  When Mets owner Fred Wilpon heard about Periscope for the first time he nearly bolted out of the room in a rush to call his legal team. The NHL gently scolded journalists who were live streaming parts of the playoff action, and the PGA banned a reporter who streamed golfers practicing before the match. But overall the response has been relatively calm. Major League Baseball’s digital chief Bob Bowman said they would monitor fans use of streaming services, but took a wait-and-see approach on enforcement, hoping to glean some insight into the future of media consumption. ""We like to watch fans and get ideas,"" he told The Wall Street Journal. Big media companies know Twitter, and by extension Periscope, have every incentive to prevent piracy. These aren’t the early days of YouTube, when the service allegedly played fast and loose with copyright in the pursuit of user growth. Beykpour said that he had a team in place to handle all DMCA takedown requests during the fight. Twitter relies on traditional media for access and advertising dollars. Without a serious approach to curbing this problem, there would be no backstage access for Twitter/Periscope at the fight, or the Oscars, or all the other big live events that synergize so well with its real time nature.   This new breed of mobile apps have plans to fight piracy, and live-streaming veterans have tools in place that can help automate this process. Ustream says it has technology that can ""fingerprint"" video to identify and remove copyrighted content within 10 seconds of a stream launching. This is similar to the content ID tools YouTube has implemented to help media companies identify and flag offending content. ""We use a combination of processes and technologies (mostly internally developed) for takedowns that we've found more effective than an automated ID tool for this type of live event,"" said Ustream CEO Brad Hunstable. For events like this, YouTube and Ustream allow content owners to sit inside the system and kill offending streams without having to file takedown notices. The quality compromises the experience, for now... There are also attempts to utilize computer vision to analyze the material on a live stream in real time. David Laun, the CEO of Dextro, says that his service can recognize complex objects — a crowd, a cat, or potentially a boxing ring — and help to target illegal broadcasts. The technology isn’t perfect: I saw it identify a stream of puppies playing as ""musicians."" But during the match on Saturday, for example, Luan says it picked up a huge cluster of images it identified as laptops and television sets. For now, the final barrier preventing rampant piracy is the technology itself. Aside from the edge case of a $99 pay-per-view, it’s unlikely most people will find a grainy live stream on their mobile phone, cluttered with strangers comments and a flood of hearts, to be worth the money they would save over buying the real thing. “Nobody wants to watch Game of Thrones on Periscope,” Beykpour said.

But the question of who will end up buying it is a big one. So far, it's been suggested that potential buyers run the gamut from German automakers, all the way to social networking companies like Facebook. Now The New York Times reports that Uber has thrown its hat in the ring with a bid to snap up Here for up to $3 billion. That would be a hefty sum for the division, but just a fraction of the $8.1 billion it paid for Navteq (Here's original company name) in 2007, which would be about $9.4 billion in today's dollars. Uber's rationale to buy its own maps is obvious Uber's interest in the company is obvious. Maps and mapping are a core part of its business today, and are set to become an even greater part of its future. Right now it has deals with other companies for some of those maps and some location information, but a purchase of Here could bring some of that technology in-house. The company's already taken steps in that direction with the acquisition of mapping company deCarta earlier this year. Looking ahead to Uber's self-driving car project, ownership of that data could both help it develop cars that run without humans, and keep from worrying that competitors have some of the same data. Uber is unlikely to be the only company bidding for Here. Previous reports from Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal have named a laundry list of companies that Nokia's been pitching to buy the piece of its business. That includes Apple, Amazon, Audi AG, BMW AG, Baidu, Facebook, Harman, Mercedes-Benz, and Sirius XM. Facebook's own interest in the company also got a little more complex this week after it began using Here's maps on its mobile site and on Android devices.   Nokia's selling off the Here unit as part of an ongoing restructuring of its business. It announced plans to sell after agreeing to spend $16.6 billion on telecoms equipment company Alcatel-Lucent last month. That deal is set to close in the first half of next year. The sale and handover of Here is expected to come much sooner, with the Times saying Nokia plans to choose a winning bid later this month.

The Kyoto video games company made a slim operating profit of ¥24.8 billion (about $207 million) and a net profit of ¥41.8 billion ($350 million) off ¥549.8 billion ($4.6 billion) in revenue, making for the first positive balance sheet reported since 2011. Although sales were down 3.8 percent year on year, the positive impact of a weakened yen boosted the company’s bottom line to 39.5 percent more than forecast.  Customers still aren't convinced by Wii U The Wii U sold just 340,000 units over the past three months, reaching a lifetime total of 9.54 million. That’s about 10 percent up on the same quarter last year, but it’s clear that a slew of solid software over the past 12 months hasn’t convinced many more consumers to get on board. Still, Nintendo expects to make an operating profit of ¥50 billion and net profit of ¥35 billion over the coming fiscal year, forecasting 3.4 million more Wii U sales. Nintendo may have ended 2014 by posting a profit, but sustaining any momentum into 2015 will require a different kind of success. Wii U and 3DS sales are unlikely to increase significantly from here on out — though Nintendo says the New 3DS models are ""off to a good start"" — and the big-hitting cards like Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros. have already been played. Nintendo doesn’t have much of note on the calendar for 2015; with The Legend of Zelda for Wii U delayed into next year, the company will either have to rely on smaller titles like Splatoon and Mario Maker or announce some big surprises at the E3 trade show next month. Still, the first mobile game to come out of the partnership with DeNA is set to hit this year, which could go either way; it could well boost Nintendo’s bottom line even without exciting the company’s traditional fans. We’re yet to hear anything about the game or even the business model there, though, so consider it a wildcard — alongside Amiibo figurines and the still-gestating ""Quality of Life"" initiative — for now.

For the first time in six years, smartphone shipments in China declined year-on-year, contracting by 4 percent to 98.8 million units in the first quarter of 2015. This represents a fall of 8 percent compared to the previous quarter, reports US market researcher IDC, although the firm notes that this is partly due to large amounts of unsold inventory left over from the end of 2014. Despite the perception of China as an emerging market for smartphones, the country is now broadly comparable to nations such as the US and UK, says IDC China's managing director Kitty Fok. ""Just like these markets, convincing existing users as well as feature phone users to upgrade to new smartphones will now be the key to further growth,"" said Fok in a statement. ""Smartphones are becoming increasingly saturated in China.""  (IDC Mobile Phone Tracker) As with the US in previous years, this seems to have put Apple in a favorable position, with the iPhone maker emerging as China's top vendor in the first quarter of 2015, shipping 14.7 percent of new devices or 14.5 million units. IDC says this is thanks to continuing demand for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, but Apple's reputation in China as a luxury brand (it's more popular than the likes of Gucci, Chanel, and Dior) might also be a factor. If consumers already have all the practical benefits of owning a smartphone, then brand prestige is needed to tempt them to upgrade. It should be noted as well that, although IDC reports Apple as China's number one vendor in the last quarter, rival market research firm IHS put Xiaomi in first place — something the smartphone maker was quick to trumpet on social media. A mature market does not mean a stable one, however. Over the past year, Samsung and Lenovo both took turns leading the Chinese market in terms of devices shipped, but landed in fourth and fifth place in the first quarter of 2015. Similarly, while Xiaomi and Huawei took second and third place in this most recent quarter thanks in part to their strategy of selling low- and mid-range devices at slim margins, IDC notes that these vendors are likely to ""push higher into the mid- to high-end segment.""

And what's worse is that almost all people who use heroin also use at least one other drug. Taken together, these two findings might explain why heroin claimed almost four times as many lives in 2013 as it did in 2000. Heroin use is ""increasing rapidly across nearly all demographics,"" says CDC director Tom Frieden. ""And with that increase we're seeing a dramatic rise in deaths.""  ""It's heartbreaking to see the return of injection drug use in the US.""  Heroin-related deaths nearly tripled between 2010 and 2013 — rising to 2.7 deaths for every 100,000 people, from one death for every 100,000 people. But beyond the increase in deaths, the rise in injection drug use is a serious health concern. Health officials have reported clusters of hepatitis C and HIV coming from opioid injection, Frieden says. ""It's heartbreaking to see the return of injection drug use in the US."" The rise in heroin use has a lot to do with with the painkiller addiction and the low cost of heroin, the CDC says. So although more people die of painkiller related overdoses in the US, heroin's rising popularity is pretty worrisome — so worrisome that the CDC is calling the trend an ""epidemic."" Today, those who are most at-risk for heroin dependence are non-Hispanic whites, people between the ages of 18 and 25, Medicaid recipients, men, people who don't have health insurance, and people who make less than $20,000 a year.

""Heroin users are no longer inner-city minority groups but now are more likely to be younger whites living outside the large urban area,"" Jane Carlisle Maxwell, a political scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, wrote in a 2015 study published in the Journal of Addictive Diseases. In 2013, white people ages 18 to 44 had the highest rate of heroin-related deaths of any group — seven for every 100,000 people. By way of comparison, two deaths for every 100,000 people occurred among the highest-risk group in 2000 — and that group was non-Hispanic blacks ages 45 to 64. Some researchers have linked the rise in heroin use to measures aimed at decreasing the non-medical use of prescription drugs: changing Oxycontin's formula to make it harder to crush and snort, and a general decrease in doctors' willingness to prescribe addictive pain-relievers. To avoid withdrawal, people who were used to taking pills turned to heroin, suggests Carlisle Maxwell, who previously served on the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services National Advisory Council. But Frieden disputes this idea. ""Improving prescribing practices for prescription opiates is part of the solution, not part of the problem,"" Frieden says. He suggests that an increase in the supply of heroin and a decrease in the drug's cost — ""the cost of heroin is roughly five times less than prescription opioids on the streets,"" Frieden says — are the main contributing factors in heroin's rising popularity. That, combined that with the fact that people who use painkillers are already ""primed"" for heroin addiction, might explain the rise in heroin use, he says. That's why he thinks reducing the over-prescription of painkillers can help reduce people's tendency to turn to heroin in the first place. The ""shift toward heroin started long before states started addressing [painkillers],"" Jones agrees. People who use painkillers ""will start to use heroin, and then shift back to opioids depending on what's available."" Regardless, one thing is clear: the strongest risk factor for heroin use is painkiller addiction. ""People who abuse or who are dependent on prescription painkillers were 40 times more likely to abuse heroin,"" Frieden says. The strongest risk factor for heroin use is painkiller addiction Previous studies have found that about 80 percent of current heroin users report having used prescription painkillers in the past, but only one percent of people who use painkillers report previous heroin use. And almost all people who use heroin also use at least one other drug — with 61 percent reporting the use of at least three different drugs. Using multiple drugs probably contributes to the high rate of heroin-related deaths. In 2013, 59 percent of the 8,257 heroin-related deaths seen across the country involved at least one other drug. Overall, the CDC's report is pretty dispiriting. But reversing these numbers is still possible, Frieden says. Curbing doctors' tendencies to over-prescribe painkillers should reduce the use of heroin, Frieden suggests.  And states can help save lives by increasing the availability of treatment facilities and safe injection equipment, and by ensuring that more people are trained to administer life-saving drugs like Naloxone during an overdose. ""Changes at the state levels are particularly important,"" Frieden says. ""We can turn it around by a package of public health care and law enforcement activities.""",0.49040974937423687,0.5095902506257631,0.8570948301099218,878,5.119589977220957,423,6.2789598108747047,0,2,"Science, US & World, Report"

Each strain of weed comes with short tasting notes Each delivery consists of a quarter-ounce of cannabis in corked bottles (although Potbox insists that it's generous with its servings, and the total weight is eight grams rather than the standard seven). Customers can choose between different strains, and each plant is labelled with information about its genetic heritage as well as some short tasting notes. Are you looking for a smoke with a ""creamy zing"" or one that offers an ""acrid and tangy onion zest""? Either way, Potbox can help you out. The company also includes two pre-rolled joints with each delivery to let customers get straight down to business, with the joints packaged in wax-sealed vials to ""ensure maximum freshness.""

Potbox offers a monthly delivery service straight to your door. (Potbox) All this luxury comes at a price though. Potbox costs $149.99 per month, which is steep compared to the estimated Californian street price of $60 for a quarter-ounce (according to crowdsourced pot index Price of Weed). Even rival delivery services such as Marvina and The Green Cross are cheaper, with the latter charging customers between $50 and $70 for a quarter-ounce of weed. Potbox says it's going to explore different delivery and quantity options in the future, but at the moment says it's justified in charging higher prices. In a press statement, Potbox CEO and co-founder Austin Heap says the company ""provides a more sophisticated alternative to the various other ‘on-demand’ cannabis delivery services that simply aggregate and deliver whatever inventory is currently available at the local dispensaries."" Heap adds that customers can ""skip the long dispensary lines, the confusion as to what to buy, any questions about freshness ... and all the other hoops they must jump through in order to receive their medicine.""

The qualifying round was a 24-hour round of furiously automated bug-hunting and patching, the culmination of years of careful team building and research. Now, after more than a month of meticulous number-crunching, the organizers are finally releasing the results — and like any DARPA challenge, the attrition rate is staggering. Starting from more than 100 teams, two preliminary challenges narrowed the field to just 28 teams competing in the qualifier. Fifteen of those suffered catastrophic failures as soon as the programs were set loose. Seven of the surviving 13 teams have now been chosen as finalists, and will be provided with free supercomputer time and a full year to refine their methods before being pitted against each other in a battle royale at 2016's Defcon conference, vying for a $2 million grand prize. Vying for a $2 million grand prize In short, the game is on. Three of the teams got seed funding from DARPA, and they otherwise run the gamut — some teams came from academic researchers at UC Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon, while others sprung out of huge corporations like Raytheon and Grammatech. The scrappiest team is CSDS, a two-person team from the University of Idaho that built its entire program from scratch, without any pre-established components. Other teams had been successful in bug-hunting contests, but had to learn automation on the fly. The hope is that, once the challenge is done, those groups will share in each other's expertise. ""What's going to emerge from this is a security automation community,"" says DARPA project manager Mike Walker, who organized the challenge. The biggest relief for Walker is that the projects worked at all, proving out the basic idea of automated bug-patching. But beyond the existential concerns, the finalists made a remarkably good showing. The test software had 590 known bugs, with an untold number of as-yet-undiscovered ones, and the best team was able to patch 261 of them. Even more impressive, every known bug was found by at least one of the teams, and every single round unearthed a new vulnerability. ""We held the world's biggest CTF and all the contestants were robots."" This round was just a static test: the computers tackled more problems than a human game would allow, but it was still just a single round, with no opportunity for opponents to seek out holes in the newly patched software. At next year's Defcon, these seven teams will have to survive dozens of rounds played out in real time on a live network, with opponents monitoring their traffic in search of a competitive advantage. Working that fast will take a lot of computing power, so for the next year, the teams will also have access to DARPA's cloud computing resources, with 1,000 Xeon cores and 16 terabytes of RAM allocated for each team. In the long term, the project could have profound implications for computer security, allowing for smarter and more responsive network monitors. But for now, it's just an automated version of a classic hacker capture-the-flag contest, in which teams compete to find and patch bugs before opponents can exploit them. As Walker proudly points out, it's already breaking records. ""There's never been an automated capture-the-flag game, and there's never been a capture-the-flag game anywhere near this big,"" says Walker, describing the latest round.

It's proposing new rules that would require service providers to notify customers of the limitations that come alongside switching over to new networks, like wireless or fiber, specifically the fact that they aren't usable during power outages, unlike copper. That means customers moved over to these new services won't have emergency phone service during storms, which can obviously be a problem.  Service providers would have to sell backup power To remedy that, the proposal would also require that service providers that move away from copper offer their customers back-up power. The back-up service won't come free, however: if consumers want it, they'll still have to pay for it, and these rules don't seem to dictate the price in any way. At first, providers will have to provide at least eight hours of back-up power; within three years, they'll have to bump that up to an entire day's worth of power. An additional proposal would require that service providers notify their customers months in advance of making any of these changes. The proposal also maintains that service providers are generally free to make these changes when they want to, so long as it doesn't result in phone service being ""discontinued, reduced, or impaired."" The commission is also asking the public what it might mean to ""reduce"" or ""impair"" a service — it's never formally defined what those actions mean. It's a tricky issue because these new networks — largely better as they may be — may still create issues for consumers. That includes not providing their own power, but there are also issues of putting legacy systems out of order, like burglary alarms and DSL internet. Formalizing these terms could help clarify how far service providers need to go toward helping consumers transition when switching services. It's not entirely clear if the commission is leaning toward making it a high or a low bar, but the goal generally seems to be offering basic protections while making sure that service providers are clear to make upgrades that would let them roll out broadband in place of copper. The proposals should be voted on in August.",0.30729577469652747,0.6927042253034725,0.8578212651012285,389,5.084832904884319,224,5.6517857142857144,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World"

The company occupied a controversial niche in the security space, contracting out surveillance software to law enforcement agencies around the world. If your phone got stuck with a wiretapping implant, there's a good chance it came from them. That made them notorious among the security community — they were exploiting the same flaws that coders were working to close — but their law enforcement ties made them hard to prosecute. They only sold to police and governments, even if the governments were some of the most corrupt and repressive in the world. When researchers caught them spying on journalists in Ethiopia, the fallout was minimal at best. There was every indication they could keep this going forever. Now, the whole company seems to be on the cusp of toppling over. Sunday night, attackers compromised Hacking Team’s internal system and released 400 gigabytes of data in an open torrent, containing everything from email archives to one unlucky soul's email encryption key. The fallout has been immediate, resulting in a full shutdown of the company's services until the damage can be contained, shutting down programs everywhere from Russian intelligence to the South Korean army. But the longterm effects may be even more profound. One of the world’s most prominent spyware vendors has been stopped in its tracks, and a company that thrived on secrets now has almost none of them left. Shutting down programs from Russian intelligence to the South Korean Army The biggest problem is a technical one: surveillance implants only work if people can't find them. But the dumped data includes detailed source code for Hacking Team's products, which will make them much easier to find in the future. Researchers can use that source code to build anti-virus signatures, or flag traffic coming from Hacking Team servers. Hacking Team held legitimate developer credentials for iOS and other ecosystems, which can also be used for monitoring. One anonymous researcher even uploaded the code to a public GitHub page where like-minded coders could piece through it together. ""I'm interested in keeping the source code, exploits and Hacking Team's actions as visible as possible,"" he said. (The GitHub page was shut down within 24 hours of launch, but has since been restored.) It's going to take a lot of work, but without the leak, the project wouldn't have been possible at all. Surveillance implants only work if people can't find them The open code also means software companies can start patching the holes that let Hacking Team break through in the first place. Companies like Hacking Team typically exploit undisclosed vulnerabilities in software — also known as ""zero-days,"" so named because software companies have had zero days’ notice to fix the flaws — to ensure that an implant can be reliably installed without the user catching on. Releasing the source code means those valuable vulnerabilities are now up for grabs. Browser vendors are already offering cash for any undisclosed vulnerabilities contained in the leak, and similar vulnerabilities are likely to pop up for Android, Blackberry, and other phones. Once they're discovered, they'll be patched, and Hacking Team will be left to start over. Once the technical damage is fixed, the political fallout could be even harder to overcome. Before the leak, Hacking Team critics could only link Hacking Team to its clients with technical evidence, and the company could always claim the country was using the software without company permission. Even then, researchers could only track down a fraction of the countries that Hacking Team was working with. Thanks to the leak, there's a full list, with the FBI, DEA, and Australian police alongside heavily sanctioned countries like Bahrain, Ethiopia, and Sudan. In Sudan's case, there's hard documentation of the deal alongside official denials to the UN that Hacking Team ever worked with the country. It's damning, and enough to drum up the kind of international backlash that research groups like Citizen Lab have been working towards for years. For the first time, Hacking Team will be outgunned by its critics The result is one of the most politically effective hacks we've seen, worlds more effective than the Sony Pictures circus. Wikileaks has focused on spyware vendors like Hacking Team for years as part of its Spy Files series, but the group has never come up with anything as damning and immediately impactful as this. Hacking Team may still recover from the attack, coming back with new source code and a fresh company name, but it will take serious effort and not a little luck. For the first time, the company may be outgunned by its critics. The broader implications are harder to predict. Customs bureaus around the world are already implementing controversial export rules that target companies like Hacking Team, and the leaks may give more strength to the new rules. US agencies like the FBI may have to dial back their surveillance rules, now that they’ve been unmasked as Hacking Team customers. But the strangest takeaway may be the reaffirmed power of the anonymous leaker who smuggled out all the data in the first place. This wasn’t a whistleblower like Snowden or a garden-variety mischief maker — what little we know points to a freelance troublemaker who had already scored smaller hits on FinFisher.

The mobile game took the core of the Hitman franchise — sneaking around and killing people — and turned it into digital board game, where a cold-blooded assassin was just a piece you moved around a board. It was weird, but it worked, and resulted in one of the best mobile puzzle games around. Now Square Enix has done the same with another unsuspecting blockbuster franchise: Tomb Raider. Lara Croft Go takes the pulpy adventures of the tomb raiding heroine and turns them into a fantastic turn-based puzzle game. The core of Lara Croft Go is the same as Hitman Go. You move Lara around the board, one space at a time, and each time you make a move so will all your enemies. The key difference is what you're actually doing; instead of planning and executing an assassination, you'll be venturing through treacherous tombs, uncovering treasures and trying to find a way out. The levels in Hitman Go were sort of like tiny, self-contained dioramas, but in Lara Croft they're much bigger and more dynamic. You'll be flipping switches to open up new areas, and avoiding giant boulders like you were Indiana Jones. Along the way a massive snake lingers in the background.   The puzzles never really grow boring or repetitive Each area in the game is its own little puzzle, and solving them means understanding all of the different gameplay elements and how they interact with each other. The enemies, for example, range from stationary snakes that will only attack if you approach them from the front, to Komodo dragon-like lizards that will follow your every movement. Sometimes you'll need to kill them to proceed — Lara shoots a lot of animals in this game — but other times you might need to trick them into flipping a switch for you. New features are introduced as you play, and they can really alter the way the game works. When Lara gets her hands on a torch, for instance, it changes the way you interact with animals, since they'll run away at the sight of fire. Lara Croft Go continually adds in features like that, so the puzzles never really grow boring or repetitive. What makes Lara Croft Go work is that, not only is it a really great puzzle game, but it fits perfectly in the Tomb Raider universe. You're playing a digital board game, sure, but it also feels like you're exploring ancient, crumbling tombs. And despite their seemingly small size, the levels still have a real sense of scale, making it feel like you're just a tiny piece exploring a huge world. The colorful graphics, meanwhile, have a real Monument Valley vibe.

More specifically, he’s not a fan of the way the game has changed as it shifted from a physical card game to perhaps the most played video game of all time, thanks to the version that comes bundled with every copy Windows. ""I love the building blocks of Solitaire,"" he explains, ""but I do hate modern Solitaire. And the more I investigated it, the more I hated it."" So he decided to not only try to fix what he believes are problems with the modern game, but also create a new version of Solitaire explicitly designed for your phone. Out today on iOS, it’s called Sage Solitaire, and I can’t stop playing. ""The original mobile game."" The core of Sage is similar to most other variations of Solitaire: your main goal is to get rid of cards and score points. Sage presents you with a three-by-three grid of card piles, which grow larger as you move from bottom right to top left. Like in Klondike Solitaire — the kind you’ve wasted too many hours playing on your work PC — the top card on each pile is turned over. In order to get rid of cards, you have to make hands. It’s sort of like poker; hands include everything from pairs to a straight flush, and the better the hand, the more points you earn. You also have to make sure your hands include cards from at least two rows, which adds an extra layer of strategy: you want to get the highest score, but you also want to ensure you don’t exhaust your supply of usable cards. It may sound complicated, but the best part about Sage is that it moves so quickly; a round of the main mode, which uses a single deck of cards, lasts just a few minutes. It may take a bit longer at first, especially if you’re not familiar with poker hands — but as soon as you understand the rules, playing is a breeze. I haven’t found myself this absorbed by a mobile puzzle game since Threes. Every element of the game feels tuned toward fast, touchscreen play — even the cards themselves have been redesigned to make the card type more prevalent, while suits have been given new colors to make it easier to quickly identify them. ""Now we have this mutant version of Solitaire."" According to Gage, Solitaire is a natural fit for a smartphone because it’s ""the original mobile game,"" as he describes it. ""When it first came out, it was the thing that we would do in a similar context to how we use our phones now,"" he adds. ""Solitaire has such roots in mobile, but it’s totally inappropriate for mobile now. Solitaire is a game that’s meant to take over a table and have a million piles, and our current phones are big, but they’re not that big."" But making Solitaire work better on mobile wasn’t Gage’s only impetus to make Sage — in fact, he says, early versions worked just fine as a traditional card game. What he really wanted to do was counteract what he saw as a growing problem with digital Solitaire games. For many of us who learned Klondike, the game works in a very peculiar way. You have seven piles of cards, and a deck where you select cards as you attempt to match the cards of all four suits together, in order. Traditionally, you flip over three cards from the deck to work with, and you can’t use the lower cards until you’ve used the one on top. But the computer version of the game changed this, so that you only flipped over a single card at a time by default — and that seemingly small rule change is a big deal for Gage. ""Going through one card at a time makes Solitaire an almost instantly solvable game,"" he explains. And it’s a problem he believes has only gotten worse — a number of mobile versions of Solitaire will even shuffle the deck in a way that ensures that you can win no matter what. ""People have built these house rules that simplify the game, and those house rules have slowly become codified into what Solitaire is. And now we have this mutant version of Solitaire."" With Sage, his goal was to create a version of the game that combined the strategy of the card versions of the game, with the randomness people seemed to love in the digital versions. ""One of the core things that’s great about modern Solitaire, is that you flip a card over and you don’t know what that card is going to be,"" he explains. ""And you have some hopes and dreams about what that card will be, and then the card reveals itself and affects your strategy. With Sage I’m trying to play up all of that tactical stuff, but still maintain a heavy dose of luck and hope."" ""You have some hopes and dreams about what that card will be."" Tackling a genre that he dislikes isn’t new territory for Gage. In 2012 he released Spelltower (right), despite the fact that he had no interest in word games. ""With Spelltower I wanted to make a word game that people who hated word games could play, and that people who loved word games would get a new experience,"" he explains. ""I’m trying to do something very similar with Sage."" The game is free to download; you don’t have to pay to play the single deck mode, but you will have to put up with interstitial ads. For $2.99 you can get rid of the ads, and play both a two-deck mode — which results in longer games — and an easier mode called ""Fifteens,"" which increases the number of possible hands. The premium version also has additional features like customizable card backs and the ability to check out in-depth stats about how you play. Gage says that the pricing model was inspired in part by Threes. While the paid version of that game was successful, several free clones managed to reach an even wider audience, resulting in an official ad-supported version that launched earlier this year. ""Watching what happened to Threes was a really brutal and eye-opening experience,"" Gage says. Solitaire is one of the most ubiquitous and popular games in the world, and so in some ways it’s a natural fit for a developer looking to reach a big audience. But it’s also a game that’s often derided as little more than a time-waster; people don’t put it on the same pedestal as games like Tetris. With Sage, Gage is hoping to show players that there’s a lot more to the game than they think. ""It’s one of the biggest video games ever, but it’s a game that we don’t like to talk about much,"" he says. ""It’s a giant game that doesn’t get a lot of respect.""",0.5623731013495833,0.4376268986504167,0.18280317989098474,1167,4.4824335904027421,518,5.6891891891891895,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Report"

That's changing today with our first glimpse of a new character wielding one of the brilliant laser swords: John Boyega's Finn. It's a brief promo clip posted on the Star Wars Instagram account, taking advantage of the service's newly-announced landscape orientation mode, in which Boyega squares off opposite Adam Driver's Ren. He's wielding a blue blade, and while the precise origins of the weapon aren't clear we can get a pretty good idea by looking at what materials have already been released about the film. Warning: Star Wars theorizing and potential spoilers ahead. Run away if you don't want to know!   The second teaser for The Force Awakens featured some sort of creature handing off a lightsaber to what appeared to be Princess Leia. That model looked identical to Anakin Skywalker's original blue weapon, which was passed down to Luke in the original Star Wars before being lost during a battle with Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back. Then during Disney's D23 convention, fans were given a new poster for The Force Awakens, featuring original artwork by legendary poster artist Drew Struzan. That image also featured Boyega holding the blue lightsaber, and at the time my colleague Kwame Opam noted that the hilt looked similar to Luke's lost weapon.  Is John Boyega holding Luke's lightsaber?? @bcbishop pic.twitter.com/RsXs4WHowU Putting those pieces together with today's footage, and it's becoming pretty clear that Finn is wielding the same lightsaber used in both the original and prequel trilogies. How he managed to get hold of the weapon — and its larger importance in the story itself — is still very much under wraps as far as official channels are concerned.

Today, ahead of the PAX Prime event in Seattle, the Dell-owned brand is launching a range of new products that should serve as solid out-of-the-box gaming solutions. First up is the X51, Alienware's mid-range desktop PC that offers impressive power in a package roughly the size of an Xbox One — previous models have won a lot of fans (myself included) for providing a strong PC gaming experience in a single, simple box. The R3 revision is the third major version of the X51, and although it keeps the same chassis, it's all changed on the inside. The first new models include Intel Skylake i5k or i7k processors, DDR4 RAM, and optional liquid cooling support, which is quieter and more efficient than a traditional fan system and allows for safer overclocking.   On the graphics side, the base GPU is an Nvidia GTX 745, but depending on configuration, you can go for an AMD Radeon R9 370 or an Nvidia GTX 960. The R3 is the first X51 model to support Alienware's external Graphics Amplifier, too (seen above), meaning you could also hook up a card as powerful as a GTX Titan X. The new models are available today from $1,099. Alienware's laptop line is also getting a big refresh across the board. The Alienware 13 (below), 15, and 17 now feature USB Type-C ports with Thunderbolt 3, faster PCIe SSD storage, and what Alienware calls ""dynamic overclocking"" — software that balances out high performance and acceptable heat levels. The 17-inch (and later, 15-inch) models can be fitted with 4K IGZO displays, and the 13-inch goes up to QHD+ (3200 x 1800).   The Alienware 13 is billed as being able to achieve ""all-day"" battery life, which the company rates at over eight hours. At the other end of the power scale, Alienware is also introducing an special edition 18-inch model featuring dual Nvidia 980M graphics totaling 16GB of fast GDDR5 memory, along with an overclocked Intel Extreme Edition processor that's socket-mounted for future upgradeability. All of these laptops are available today, but they run on Haswell processors for now, as Intel hasn't fully rolled out Skylake beyond desktops just yet.

It’s an impressive feat, capping off a summer movie season in which Universal held four of the top 10 domestic box office spots, easily holding off rivals like Disney despite the spandex-clad power of Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man.  How did Universal pull it off? Sure, the studio had the runaway success of Jurassic World, but it also bolstered its slate with diverse successes like Pitch Perfect 2 and Straight Outta Compton. Over at our sister site Vox, the always-excellent Todd VanDerWerff dissected the strategy that led to Universal’s big summer — one it achieved, he points out, without a single superhero. But by now, a film doesn’t just need a masked avenger as its protagonist to be a superhero movie. Within the top titles of the summer are a number of movies that adhered to the familiar conventions, themes, and tropes of the modern Marvel superhero movie — and the result was tremendous success, across the board.   2015 wasn’t the summer when superhero movies ruled; it was the summer when every film learned to be a superhero movie. There are a few broad traits that characterize the comic book films we’ve come to expect every summer at the multiplex. There’s a general elasticity with physics and logic; and a bombastic aesthetic, offering up an audio-visual roller coaster ride that can’t be duplicated on a living room set-up. The characters and stakes are appropriately comic-booky and larger than life — these aren’t the stories of normal people, we’re told;  these are the stories of legends. And if you’re smart, your legends always come in packs. Since Joss Whedon first established the template in 2012 with The Avengers, the pinnacle of superhero movies has involved the creation of a super-powered team of lead characters. They vary across race, ethnicity, gender, even political ideologies, but the core message is that a team can always affect greater change than just a single person, no matter how gifted that individual may be. That core concept isn’t new, of course; it’s an idea that runs through thousands of years of fiction. But what has become new — and arguably essential — in the last few years is the idea of the superhero movie ensemble, to such a degree that Warner Bros. is now cannonballing into ensembles of both comic book good guys (Justice League) and bad guys (Suicide Squad). Avengers: Age of Ultron kicked the summer off in full force, but it wasn’t the only movie about a super-powered team of heroes. With a release date of April 3rd, the latest installment in the Dominic Toretto saga technically came out just ahead of summer, but it’s the leading example of the non-superhero superhero movie. Over the course of seven films, Dom and his gang have created a tight-knit team that lives and dies by the contributions of each and every member. Whether they’re battling the Shaw brothers or Letty’s amnesia, the message stays on point: family comes first.   Calling the Pitch Perfect series ""The Avengers for a capella singing"" may seem like a stretch, but it’s basically The Avengers for a capella signing. Anna Kendrick and the rest of The Bellas left enough of a quirky impression for audiences to be reasonably assured of all the notes they’d hit the second go-round. Whereas one-note gags comprise the bulk of their ""superpowers,"" each member of the ensemble brings something unique to the group, and it’s only when they unite that they’re able to vanquish their foes (and sing ""Cups"").   The Despicable Me series smartly took the idea of the comic supervillain and upended it by making the would-be antagonist the hero of the story. This year’s prequel, however, focuses on the gibbering, yellow Minions, and their search for a new tyrant to work with. Because they’re Minions, they basically can’t get anything right — that is, until they decide to team up. Then they save the day and people get knighted. Add in the presence of Sandra Bullock’s supervillain Scarlet Overkill, and you’ve got a superhero movie for toddlers. See also: Straight Outta Compton, Inside Out   There was a time when the stakes of a story could be small, intimate; even personal. In the modern superhero film, however, that simply won’t do: movies ratchet up the destruction and peril to unimaginable stakes, so the fate of the entire world — or even multiple worlds — hangs in the balance. (With the population facing such constant peril, I have a suspicion that therapists in the Marvel Cinematic Universe are cleaning up.) With that kind of danger comes a matching, nearly comical villain — no matter what the genre. If you want a villain that can be intelligent as well as menacing, you’d be better served looking elsewhere. Like in 1988, when Die Hard came out. Colin Trevorrow’s meta-take on the summer blockbuster spins this trope around and gives it back to the audience no less than three different ways. There’s the broad, ""corporations want us to make meaner dinosaurs"" brush the film paints with, followed by the crazed, militaristic trainer played by Vincent D’Onofrio (the fact that he plays a more relatable human being in Netflix’s Daredevil speaks volumes). Then there’s the biggest bad of them all: the Indominus Rex, a walking, breathing, eating manifestation of the evils of corporate greed. The original Jurassic Park did just fine by putting a handful of children and adults in jeopardy in an isolated park, but Trevorrow’s dinosaurs lay waste to Samsung, Starbucks, and a dozen other brands in the park’s product placement pavilion, thereby attacking our very way of life.   The Mission: Impossible series already operated at the intersection of action and fantasy that James Bond calls home, but in Rogue Nation, things go full tilt. Driving the entire plot forward is the icy glare of Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), a super-bad spy guy that went rogue to become an even more super-bad spy guy. Lane is the kind of character that can orchestrate a global conspiracy while flying under the radar of every major spy agency. It’s all so convoluted and preposterous that he might as well carry a cane and call himself Loki — but given the superhuman powers of Tom Cruise, it feels perfectly at home. See also: Furious 7's indestructible Deckard Shaw; Pitch Perfect 2's fascist a capella collective Das Sound Machine; Minion's scene-chewing Scarlet Overkill   At the core of every superhero story is some variant of the the Hero’s Journey monomyth: an individual is pulled from obscurity into a conflict larger than themselves, they discover magical skills and powers that help them win a great victory, and then they return, changed for the better. It can be Tony Stark inventing the Arc Reactor and Iron Man suit, or Peter Parker getting bitten by a radioactive spider, but the principles are the same. Take away the comic book trappings, and that same pattern showed up all over this summer’s movies. Pete Docter’s film gets well-deserved credit for its inspired concept — that a young girl’s mind is actually piloted by five different emotions. But the movie isn’t really the story of that young girl; it’s the story of Sadness and Joy, and the adventure they go on together. More importantly, it’s about Sadness’ discovery that she has something special and vital to contribute — a superpower, if you will — to enhance the other emotions her colleagues bring to the table, and to provide balance to the mind of the young girl she’s helping shape.   I found Compton to be one of the most entertaining movies of the year, and the N.W.A biopic also managed to be the most convincing superhero movie of the bunch. In terms of undiscovered powers, the movie catches up with Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, and Ice Cube when they’re still teenagers, just beginning to understand their craft. Eazy-E hasn’t even rapped before when we first see him in the film, but as they embrace their powers, they reach levels of fame and success they never could have imagined. Shadowing over the group the entire time is the most nefarious supervillain of the summer — the L.A.P.D. — which from the opening scene of the film is shown to be an oppressive, harassing, and violent force, even toward those that have done nothing wrong. When N.W.A comes together for the group’s first live show, it’s a reveal that trumps anything from Marvel’s world: it’s the unveiling of a true force of nature, one that would go on to irrevocably change music and culture at large. See also: Minions, Ant-Man, Chris Pratt's weird dinosaur-whispering thing in Jurassic World   Of course, sharing traits doesn’t immediately guarantee success, and there were plenty of movies this summer that aspired to the superhero mold but came up short. Magic Mike XXL was the closest thing to a superhero movie about male strippers that the world had seen since, well, the first Magic Mike, but it failed to excite audiences the second time around, and Entourage found itself peddling an aspirational male fantasy well past its expiration date. The ugliest stumble, however, was Fantastic Four. The source material of Josh Trank’s movie was the blueprint for the modern comic book blockbuster, long before The Avengers came around: a team of people plucked from obscurity, endowed with magical powers, and forced to overcome their differences to stop a villain bent on world destruction. If making movies was as simple as filling out a form, Four would have been good to go. But whether it was the result of directorial issues, studio interference, or a toxic combination of both, it instead managed to emerge as not just one of the worst movies of the summer, but perhaps one of the worst movies in the history of the entire genre. There may be a group of characters that team up at some point, but they’re never developed, nor are they given the ability to play off one another and overcome their differences. They may be given powers, but those powers induce disgust, not wonder. And when the Fantastic Four finally do unite, it’s not entirely clear what they stand for. Fantastic Four is a superhero movie in name only — hitting the beats needed to whip up a movie poster, but failing in every facet of actual execution. In that sense, it’s the perfect Hollywood cautionary tale. To the dismay of marketing departments everywhere, great movies aren’t created by throwing together a few topline elements with a plot framework and hoping for the best. Audiences have come to expect a certain amount of structure and familiarity, and as the comic book sensibility seeps into other genres, that arguably becomes even more important: audiences may not always know what they’ll like ahead of time, but they can almost always tell when a movie doesn't deliver what it promised. And the conventions of the superhero movie have been embedded deep within an entire generation of moviegoers. The good news is that there will be plenty of opportunities for studios to learn that lesson. Judging from this summer’s box office, the superhero movie — no matter what genre it may happen to be in — isn’t going away anytime soon.",0.7712038817485662,0.22879611825143376,0.185881984050673,1949,4.9189327860441248,963,6.3302180685358254,0,44,"Culture, Entertainment, Film"

When the company first started showing 2009's Borderlands to people, it was greeted with incredulity and the well-intentioned advice to ""just do more Brothers in Arms."" Now, millions of sales later, and with Borderlands 2 distinguishing itself as publisher 2K Games' best-selling title, few would question the wisdom of developing that madcap game. But doubters always persist, and their attention may be turned to Gearbox's first new IP in a long time: Battleborn. If Borderlands was unusual for its combination of frenetic first-person shooter action with the more strategic elements of role-playing games, Battleborn is even less amenable to genre classification because it tries to also integrate elements of multiplayer online battle arena games. It's Mass Effect meets Halo meets Dota 2. Yes, that's as crazy a recipe as one for green pea guacamole, but dammit it sure seems to work. I tried Battleborn during Gamescom in Cologne earlier this month and it left me with a huge grin on my face.  A huge grin and a burning curiosity to know more. This week, I caught up with the person responsible for safely steering the Battleborn ship from here to its February 9th release date, Gearbox president and CEO Randy Pitchford. Despite his lofty title, Pitchford is very obviously a game designer first and foremost, and his careful study of what makes games fun to play is immediately apparent. Battleborn has a comical aesthetic and doesn't take itself too seriously, but the design underpinning the game is the very opposite: thoughtful, deliberate, and beguilingly sophisticated. The kernel from which Battleborn sprouted, Pitchford says, was Gearbox's belief that the joy and reward of role-playing games could be delivered in a more condensed form. Pitchford and his team set themselves the challenge of taking the RPG loop — win fights, collect loot, buy items, and improve your hero so you can win more fights — and tighten it from the 40 or 50 hours that might be required to max out a Borderlands character to something immediate enough to please gamers who might only have a half-hour to spare. The first game that gave him confidence that his goal was possible was Warcraft 3, where characters could be leveled up during the course of a match, and he then spent a lot of time playing the Defense of the Ancients mod of that game (which was to become Dota 2) and the ever-popular League of Legends. He saw how those MOBA titles recreated the satisfaction of developing a character in a format that didn't require days of committed, grinding effort. Nonetheless, Gearbox's expertise is in making first-person shooters and Pitchford tells me that FPS is still his favorite interface for playing any game. So how did he hope to bridge the gap between his favored genre and this new class of multiplayer games? The answer, he noticed, was that there wasn't really much of a gap at all: the appeal of MOBAs isn't actually tied to their overhead view. The interface, he says, is ""like the mouse pointer on a desktop,"" it's just a conduit, and what matters is the experience you're interacting with. Pitchford's greatest insight, in my judgment, is to perceive MOBAs not as true multiplayer games, but as single-player experiences with multiplayer layered on top. In an FPS, he notes, ""if there’s only one player left in the game, you win by default."" There's no game left to play. But in a match of Dota, a solitary player still has minions and defensive structures to contend with. He or she can still level up and develop, independently of the other human participants. That's how a typical MOBA game is played: heroes feed on the cannon fodder minions spawning from their enemy's base until they're strong enough to attempt to battle each other. And ultimately, their goal is to destroy the enemy's base, not kill the enemy. Murder is just a convenient shortcut. Armed with that understanding, Pitchford says you can take a first-person shooter and turn it into a much more accessible and varied gaming experience. You're no longer tied down to a narrow set of skills. Sure, you'll still need a fast trigger finger and impeccable reactions, but players that are able to farm and loot the map faster, gain more levels, and make better upgrade and item choices, will have a fighting chance as well. Equally important, the newbie thrown into a competitive FPS match is usually treated to a series of unhappy beatdowns, with no positive reinforcement. In a MOBA title, and in games like Battleborn and Titanfall, no matter how uninformed or unskilled you may be, there will always be lowly NPC underlings to crush and things to destroy. Perhaps my familiarity with Dota helps here, but when I first jumped into Battleborn, the game was immediately intuitive and betrayed no hint of the contrast of styles that it was blending together. There's really nothing preventing hero upgrades and evolution through the course of an FPS match, and Battleborn makes this easy with a bifurcated skill tree that allows me to choose my next augmentation with lightning quickness. Not only is this extra element possible, it's also incredibly fun, and Pitchford stresses that ""leveling up is awesome,"" and was always a fundamental part of the game his company wanted to build. Beyond the gameplay, Gearbox had to also think about how to present each match and battle so as to properly combine the depth of role-playing games with the kinetic immediacy of first-person shooters and general lack of narrative in MOBAs. The answer was to adopt an episodic structure, says Pitchford: ""each scenario in Battleborn is kind of like a TV episode, you can play them in any order, and each one has a beginning, middle, and end. And they are super replayable."" His team is taking the modularity of competitive online multiplayer and embedding it into the traditional structure of single-player, story-driven titles. It's a compromise between the two, of course, but it certainly adds more meaning to the team-based scuffles and clashes that you'll be partaking in, while also making the storyline feel more alive with the inclusion of co-op play. MOBA games are famous for their infinite hero customizations and cosmetic items that players can buy — which has proven lucrative enough for Valve and Riot Games to support their games as free-to-play titles — however Pitchford stresses that Gearbox will not be ""trying to make money by selling hats."" He's fully conscious of the user demand for customization, and Battleborn will bring a new level of sophistication to how extensively hero models can be modded, but this will be a game that follows traditional retail economics. There's an undercurrent in his response that tells me he's more worried about completing and releasing the game on time, and mods and other downloadable additions will be things to address once the bigger task is completed. There is also the fact that Battleborn will come with 25 distinct characters that not only look different, but also function very differently. Whereas in Borderlands every hero moved at the same speed, and fired weapons and crouched in the same way, in Battleborn each has his or her (or its) own unique physics. ""Some can fly, some are only melee, each jumps to a different height,"" says Pitchford, and instead of a single hero-specific action skill, you have a whole plethora of abilities. And what's coolest about the whole thing is that those abilities will then either mesh or clash with your teammates' skills, adding an extra layer of depth and replayability to the multiplayer game and encouraging you to experiment. ""The meta game design,"" says Pitchford, ""is such that you'll want to play with more heroes,"" whether it be to overcome particular loot-granting challenges that are best suited to a given hero, or just to find the best synergies in a five-person team. And oh yes, winning matches will drop hero-specific loot, so that will be another nudge to get you to play with more than just space marine Oscar Mike. Paramount in Gearbox's design of Battleborn have been two things: accessibility and flexibility. The game should be easy to get into and it should adapt to your particular demands. Randy Pitchford summarizes it as an effort to make it so that ""for the most part, you have total agency to decide who you’re gonna choose and how you’re gonna play."" And if you have the extra time and inquisitiveness to delve deeper, ""a lot of it is emergent from the experience you’re having in the game itself."" You'll be drawn in to learn each character's backstory and skill set simply because the game is fun and well designed, and because it has enough variety to let you invent unforeseen hero and ability combinations. What else could you possibly ask for from a game? Battleborn will be released on PC, PS4, and Xbox One on February 9th next year, and yes, there will be local co-op.

License to stream The group, which licenses music to organizations and distributes the resulting royalties to artists, insists that SoundCloud needs a ""PRS for Music license"" to legally stream the music of members in the UK. Without the license, SoundCloud is not properly compensating PRS members for their work, PRS claims. PRS said in a statement that it sent SoundCloud a list of 4,500 songs that infringe on the copyright held by its members, and SoundCloud removed just 250 of them. PRS says SoundCloud can either obtain a license to pay for the use of these songs, or remove them entirely. It's not clear if PRS is referring to songs uploaded by the artists themselves, or unauthorized samples and uploads. If it's the former, it's possible PRS and its members have conflicting opinions about what should be available on SoundCloud. PRS claims it's trying to ""establish a principle"" with the lawsuit: SoundCloud has been having a rough year so far. Sony began pulling its artists from the service in May after the two companies failed to reach a payment agreement. And SoundCloud has recently been getting more aggressive about copyright infringement, but that's causing a lot of DJs (who are some of SoundCloud's most prolific users) to jump ship. A SoundCloud spokesperson told The Verge that SoundCloud and PRS were still in the middle of negotiations when PRS decided to sue: It is regrettable that PRS appears to be following this course of action in the midst of an active commercial negotiation with SoundCloud. We believe this approach does not serve the best interests of any of the parties involved, in particular the members of the PRS, many of whom are active users of our platform and who rely on it to share their work and communicate with their fanbase.

Six years ago, 16GB was plenty of storage for the puny 3-megapixel images the iPhone 3GS captured. Today, Apple announced the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, which start at, you guessed it, 16GB of storage. Pricing for the new phones starts at $199 on contract or $649 outright. Purchased on an installment plan, the new phones will cost $27 per month. Read next: The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus review. In today's world, 16GB doesn't get you very far. The new iPhones have 12-megapixel cameras and can capture 4K video, both of which will eat up that storage in a hurry. Apps are getting increasingly larger all the time, and many mobile games take up gigabytes of storage on their own. When your free space runs out, you might find yourself deleting photos and videos to make room or unable to install the latest iOS updates from Apple. 16GB doesn't get you far in today's world You could (and probably should) buy the 64GB or 128GB versions of the new iPhones, but most people won't. The most popular iPhone every year is the one that costs the least, and that happens to also have 16GB of storage. Other similarly priced flagship smartphones offer at least 32GB of storage to start, or they have the ability to expand that with microSD cards. Only Apple knows why it chose to stick with 16GB as the entry-level iPhone option, when it increased the mid-level and top tiers to 64GB and 128GB last year. It likely has to do with profit margins and not cannibalizing sales of the more expensive models, but earlier this year, Apple's senior vice president of marketing Phil Schiller said that cloud storage was ""lightening the load"" for devices without much local storage. That solution is a bit hard to accept, as Apple still only provides a measly 5GB of free iCloud storage, and larger storage options cost monthly fees ranging from $0.99 to $9.99. Chances are that Apple will sell boatloads of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, many of them being the 16GB size. But if you're a savvy buyer, you might want to budget a little more for the higher tier models if you're planning to get the new iPhone this year.

Apple's Taptic Engine is also built into the phone to provide feedback. The features will also appear in  the new iPhone 6S Plus. Read next: The iPhone 6s review.  While the iPhone 6S maintains the same design and 4.7-inch display size as the iPhone 6, it's being offered in a new color: rose gold. There had been some earlier talk that Apple might offer the phone in pink, and it's easy to see why there was some confusion — rose gold can look very pink in the right light. The phone is also built out of several new materials. It's using a new aluminum, which Apple says is its own custom alloy. And its display is now covered with a new glass, the same Ion-X that's used on the Apple Watch Sport. You can bet that these changes are, at least in part, designed to make the phone less prone to bending. 3D Touch enables two new ways to interact with the iPhone, which Apple is calling ""peek"" and ""pop."" Peek allows you to press on app icons and other buttons to pull up shortcuts directly into specific features. Pressing on the Camera app, for instance, offers the option to jump right into taking a selfie. Pressing on the Facebook app gives you the option of updating your status, taking a photo, checking in, or starting a search. Pop allows you to pull up overlays of photos and videos without actually having them take over the screen; once you move away, you'll be right back to where you were before. The iPhone 6S is also running on a new 64-bit processor, Apple's A9. As usual, Apple isn't giving the nitty gritty details of the processor, but it says that it's going to be 70 percent faster at CPU tasks and 90 faster at GPU tasks, in both cases over the iPhone 6's A8 processor.     Apple is putting a 12-megapixel rear camera in the new iPhone. This is the first time that Apple has bumped its camera's megapixel count since the iPhone 4S in 2011. It's long held that it wasn't worth adding pixels because it would lead to noisier images, but Apple claims that it's now managed to make the change without doing that. The camera is also now capable of recording 4K video, and it's supposed to have an improved autofocus in all cases. It also says that the camera has an improved autofocus. One thing that hasn't changed? The lens still protrudes from the back of the phone. The front camera is getting a change, too. It's now a 5-megapixel camera, and Apple has figured out a neat way of giving it a flash: the phone's display just lights up really bright — apparently up to three times brighter than it usually would. It'll also customize the color that it flashes to match the ambient lighting of the environment a photo is being taken in. You're also going to be taking a lot more videos with this new phone. Apple is introducing a feature called ""live photos,"" which will capture a short clip of video alongside every photo that you take. You can turn the feature off, but it's on by default, capturing a second and a half to both sides of every photo. A 12 megapixel image is still captured right in the middle. It's a pretty neat idea — even if HTC and others tried features like this years ago — but there's one reason to be worried about it: storage. All that video is going to take up a lot of space, regardless of how ""space efficient"" Apple claims they'll be. A pricing plan is, strangely enough, among the most interesting announcements Apple is also demonstrating new animated wallpapers on the phone — those may be part of iOS 9 in general, however. The iPhone 6S is also supposed to be getting faster wireless speeds over both Wi-Fi and LTE. Apple says that Wi-Fi should be twice as fast, and LTE is improving with the addition of more bands, now up to 23. Touch ID is also supposed to be improved on this model of the iPhone. Apple didn't go into a lot of detail there, but presumably it'll be faster or more accurate than the sensor on the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6. The new iPhone will be available starting at $199 on a two-year contract, starting at 16GB of storage and going up to 64GB and 128GB for $100 more per tier. But most carriers are moving away from two-year contracts and over to payment plans now, so Apple is offering some of those, too. The 6S will be available for $27 per month. But there's another more interesting payment plan: for $32 per month, you can lease an iPhone and then return it for a new model every single year. It also includes the AppleCare+ warranty from Apple. Preorders begin September 12th, with sales beginning September 25th.

The addition of 3D Touch has been widely expected, having been rumored in recent days and weeks, and it's a pretty obvious one — it could mean big things for iPhone gaming, for instance. New gestures called ""Peek"" and ""Pop"" let you call up contextual menus on home screen icons, letting you go directly to features in apps that you use most; inside apps, Peek can preview information, while Pop can take you into it. It sounds like developers will have some runway to decide exactly how these light and hard presses are integrated into their UIs.

Update: Read the iOS 9 review. The company did not specify a time of day for the release, but Apple traditionally releases upgrades at 1PM ET and is expected to do the same with iOS 9. Most of the upgrades in the new iOS focus on making iPhones smarter, faster, and more efficient. The biggest change is the iPad's new multitasking mode, which allows users to run two apps side by side simultaneously, similar to features in Surface and Galaxy tablets. Siri is also getting an upgrade, as a new feature called Proactive will offer contextual user suggestions based on habits, location, or time of day. Spotlight searches will also get more powerful, allowing users to search content within apps and perform unit conversions without opening a web search.  For anyone upgrading immediately, the biggest difference will be size and speed.

After running through some stats illustrating the iPhone's remarkable growth in China, Tim Cook introduced this year's generation, called the iPhone 6S. ""The only thing that's changed is everything,"" says Cook. ""These are the most advanced smartphones in the world."" The iPhone 6S Plus retains its 5.5-inch Retina display, but this time it's covered by a new, even tougher glass, which Apple describes as the strongest in the industry. It will also feature 3D Touch, implementing a version of the Force Touch functionality that was first introduced with the Apple Watch and MacBook touchpads earlier this year. Read next: The iPhone 6S review. You can use 3D Touch to get a ""peek"" at content in apps like email and then, if you keep holding, enter the particular message. 3D Touch allows you to press down on the iPhone's screen to pull up new menus, activate shortcuts, and generally interact with the device in new ways. This has been woven in throughout the iOS interface and default apps to give extra contextual functionality tied to pressure detection. Apple's Taptic Engine is also built into the phone to  provide feedback.   The new iPhone 6S Plus will come with a new processor, the A9, which promises to be 70 percent faster than Apple's current A8, with up to 90 percent better graphics performance. The M9 co-processor is, for the first time, embedded directly into the main A9 chip. On the outside, the 6S Plus will be available in a new rose gold color, which will be made out of a new aluminum that Apple says is its own custom alloy. All-new 12-megapixel iSight camera Both new iPhone 6S models will come with an all-new 12-megapixel iSight camera. ""We were not going to add pixels until we were sure we would do so without trading off the legendary quality of the iSight camera,"" says Phil Schiller. After showing off a series of images testifying to his claim that the iPhone's image quality remains excellent, Schiller also announced that the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus will be able to shoot and edit 4K video. Integrating its two big tentpole announcements today, Apple has also developed something called Live Photos. When you use 3D Touch to press on a photo, it will animate into a brief video with sound. The trick is done by capturing the 1.5 seconds just before and immediately after the shutter is triggered for the photo. It's not technically a video, as it's still capturing 12-megapixel shots on either side, at full quality. These Live Photos will be accessible across Apple's product range, including OS X El Capitan Macs, iOS devices, and even the Apple Watch. Live Photos are the default mode for all photos taken with the new iPhones. The iPhone 6S Plus with 16GB will start at $299 on a two-year contract. That's $100 more than the 4.7-inch iPhone 6S, and the same price differential continues as you upgrade your choice of storage: the iPhone 6S Plus with 64GB will cost $399 and the one with 128GB will be $499. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models all get a $100 price cut and will continue to be available.  Preorders for the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus start this Saturday, September 12th, and general availability will follow on September 25th.

The proposed telescope has a primary mirror that’s nearly 40 feet across — nearly twice the size of JWST. The new proposed telescope should be situated at the second Earth-Sun Lagrange point (L2), an area of space nearly 1 million miles from Earth. Its main goal is to directly image dozens of Earth-like exoplanets throughout our Universe. AURA presented the concept at the American Museum of Natural History this afternoon, through a panel discussion led by Neil deGrasse Tyson.  The space agency has yet to launch the JWST, the successor to the Hubble that will use infrared to look deeper into the Universe than ever before; that telescope will go up some time in 2018. But AURA says it’s time start thinking beyond the JWST. In 1996, AURA wrote a report about what should come after Hubble, and that idea ultimately turned into JWST. Now, they think HDST is the best option for 25 years down the road. ""Are we alone in the Universe?"" The new design is the closest thing we have to a successor for the JWST. Currently, James Webb is considered the next-generation space telescope, surpassing Hubble in scope and ability. It too will sit at the second Earth-Sun Lagrange point — but its goal is more general: to look back in time. The James Webb telescope will use infrared, mostly to observe galaxies that are up to 13 billion light years away. Since the Universe is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old, the light seen from these galaxies will be from when they were very young or just forming, allowing us to get a glimpse of the dawn of the early cosmos. AURA is in favor of JWST. But the group also says astrophysicists are in need of a different kind of telescope with a more focused goal. The group, in a statement, argues that despite how much our species has discovered, we still don't have the answers to some of our biggest questions: ""Are we alone in the Universe? Are other Earth-like worlds common? Do any have signs of life? How did life emerge from a lifeless cosmic beginning?"" AURA says with the right telescope, we can finally resolve these queries.   That's where the HDST comes in. After launch, the scope will directly image exoplanets orbiting around hundreds of stars. That’s similar to the goal of the Kepler mission, a space observatory launched by NASA to discover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Right now, thanks to Kepler and other Earth-based observations, we’ve found nearly 2,000 exoplanets in our Universe. Most of them haven’t been seen directly, but astronomers estimate that there are around 11 billion Earth-size planets orbiting Sun-like stars in the coveted ""habitable zones"" — regions around stars in which planets can support liquid water — in the Milky Way Galaxy alone. So AURA wants a better telescope to peek at these worlds — hence HDST, which is, essentially, the James Webb telescope but with a Kepler mission. Unlike Kepler, HDST is designed to image exoplanets directly. Right now, we rely on indirect imaging methods to catalog exoplanets — such as observing the periodic dimming that occurs when exoplanets cross in front of their host stars. The proposed HDST improves on that. It may be able to observe the dim light the planets throw off directly, using wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared. That means the observatory will be able to directly characterize a planet's atmosphere — an important feature that will help determine whether or not these space rocks house life. With a big enough sample of planetary atmospheres, AURA argues it will be much more possible to observe the ""telltale"" signs of life. The observatory will be able to directly characterize a planet's atmosphere ""If life is rare, HDST will take us from our current complete ignorance of the occurrence rate of inhabited worlds to a first constraint, potentially showing how remarkable our own existence is,"" AURA writes. ""If life is common, a large sample of terrestrial worlds with highly unusual atmospheric chemistry will secure our belief that life of some kind exists beyond the Earth, regardless of possible false positives."" Some of the technology needed to turn HDST into reality isn't ready. In order to accurately capture an exoplanet's atmosphere, astronomers will need an as-yet undeveloped technique known as starlight suppression. Many of these worlds orbit incredibly bright stars that engulf the exoplanets in light, making them extremely hard to see; some exoplanets are about 10 billion times fainter than their host stars. Starlight suppression, in theory, would block out starlight to one part per 10 billion to allow for direct detection of orbiting planets. Today’s announcement is a kind of heads up to physicists to develop the technology to make the HDST telescope possible. Since the Kepler mission, we’ve known there are other Earthlike planets in the habitable zone, but the indirect methods of observation make it hard to puzzle out what atmospheres — if any — surround these planets. If we want to know for sure which planets may be our best hopes for finding out whether we’re alone out here, we’ll need to look at these worlds directly. With proper funding, HDST could give us our best look yet.

No, not Texas post-rock — the great scientific display that is a fireworks show.  ""Fireworks are an application of chemistry and engineering: you need good chemistry to get the effects up in the sky and good engineering to make sure they get to the right altitude and burst at the right time,"" John Conkling, the former director of the American Pyrotechnics Association, tells The Verge. Firework shows last between 15 to 20 minutes on average, but the amount of planning and preparation that goes into producing these displays can take up to two years. Designers need ample time to determine the right colors and shapes they want to use, and to time the explosions to the soundtrack.  To produce the colorful patterns and shapes you see, fireworks utilize a precise chemical mixture that’s going to burn at the right temperature, at the right time, and with the right colors. That requires four main chemical ingredients — an oxidizer, a fuel, a colorant, and a binder. Fireworks need plenty of oxygen to facilitate the burn, which is where oxidizers come in. An oxidizer is pretty much what it sounds like — a chemical rich in O2. Oxidizers release excess oxygen to make a better explosion. The most commonly used oxidizers are nitrates, chlorates, and perchlorates. Of course, any fire needs fuel. In fireworks, that’s typically charcoal or sulfur. The fuel combines with the oxygen released by the oxidizer, setting the stage for an explosion when fire’s added. These chemicals used for the fuel and the oxidizer are some of the same ones found in standard gunpowder, which is an essential element in fireworks. Fireworks utilize a precise chemical mixture The fuel and oxidizer chemicals are used in three different ways. The fuse used to light the tiny rocket is made of very fine gunpowder, which allows the wick to burn at a very controlled rate. This gives whoever lit the firework some time to get out of the way. The burning fuse then lights much larger granulations of gunpowder at the bottom of the firework. That explosion carries the rocket into the sky. Finally, pellets of gunpowder are packed in the firework’s body. These capsules are what ultimately force the firework to burst apart. Also contained within these pellets is the colorant and the binder. The colorant chemicals help determine the different colors we see, and the binder — often a type of starch called dextrin — binds the fuel, oxidizer, and colorant together within the pellets. When the packets explode, the chemical elements emit light, and the colorant produces very specific wavelengths that can be seen by the naked eye. The colors you see all depend on the different chemicals you use. For red, you want a strontium compound, and for green, you need a barium compound. Copper compounds are needed to make blue, while sodium compounds will give you a yellow-orange.  There are limits on the types of chemicals you can use, however. For one, they can’t be agents that collect moisture, or else they won’t burn properly when lit. Sodium is great for making yellow fireworks, but you can't use sodium chloride — or common table salt — since it holds water. You also want to make sure your explosion isn’t propelling any toxic chemicals into the environment — so any compounds used in fireworks must be benign. ""Years and years ago, blue was made with an arsenic compound; it made a beautiful blue, but clearly arsenic is not something we want to be putting in the atmosphere,"" says Conkling. ""So you want to make sure it’s green — not the color green — but environmentally green."" So from its initial lighting to its final spectacular explosion, a firework’s life begins with a lit gunpowder fuse, followed by a gunpowder-boost into the sky, and finishes with an explosion of a chemical medley of fuels, oxidizers, colorants, and binders.

The institute announced this week that it will be issuing grants to 37 research teams, whittled down from an applicant list of around 300. The teams are taking on the killer AI issue from different angles, including teaching AI to learn what humans want, aligning robots' interests with our own, and keeping AI under human control.  The institute provided this summary highlighting some of the grants: A full list of the grant winners, as well as descriptions of their projects, is available at the institute's site. About $7 million will be split between the research teams in total, coming from Musk and the Open Philanthropy Project. Most of the projects should begin work this September, and the institute intends to keep them funded for up to three years. The program also has a remaining $4 million, which will be distributed later on, as the institute determines which areas of research appear to be the most promising. The research also addresses more practical questions While there's a lot of talk about this research being meant to prevent a Terminator situation, the institute is now explicitly trying to play down that type of language. ""The danger with the Terminator scenario isn’t that it will happen, but that it distracts from the real issues posed by future AI,"" Future of Life Institute president Max Tegmark says in a statement. ""We're staying focused, and the 37 teams supported by today’s grants should help solve such real issues."" It's a fair statement: the institute is thinking about some very practical concerns, including how to optimize AI's economic impact, so that it doesn't create further income inequality by destroying jobs. It's also looking into how AI should handle ethical dilemmas, such as being presented with different options in an unavoidable car crash. That said, there are very much some killer robot concerns in the mix. Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has stated quite clearly that it's a concern of his. He's brought up Terminator in the past while discussing his concerns about the evolution of AI and stated that AI has the potential to be ""more dangerous than nukes."" Part of the Future of Life Institute's goal is to prevent that possibility by making sure that AI remains under human control and following humans' best interests. These first 37 projects are the beginning of that work. It may seem early — but Musk and others behind the institute would rather see the research done now, rather than when powerful AI is already around.",0.7665766067284059,0.23342339327159412,0.8538734077798914,462,4.9783549783549788,273,5.8937728937728942,0,0,"Science, Tech"

Land Rover also says the tech will be able to detect broken drain covers and raised manhole covers, and it believes the tech will ultimately reduce damage to vehicles.  Land Rover views this as a step toward more autonomous cars The technology isn't being built into a consumer vehicle just yet — it's still in testing on research vehicles. But building it into a car doesn't appear to require much more technology than what's already inside of them. Land Rover is adding on a forward-facing camera, potentially allowing its car to scan the road ahead, but it's also relying on information from the car's suspension and GPS to round out the picture. Once the data's been gathered, however, the car will need a way to send the information off and relay it to other vehicles, so this won't be very useful until there are a lot of connected cars on the road. Land Rover has bigger plans for the tech down the road, as development continues. It sees detecting potholes as a step toward a more fully autonomous car. ""In the future, we are looking to develop systems that could automatically guide a car around potholes without the car leaving its lane and causing a danger to other drivers,"" Mike Bell, Jaguar Land Rover's connected car director, says in a statement.

The car isn't ready for this year's race, but it will be next year, running in the LM GTE-Pro category. Rumors of Ford's interest in participating in LeMans predate the announcement of the new GT itself. In fact, the car likely owes its existence to the race: next year marks the 50th anniversary of the company's legendary 1-2-3 win at LeMans in 1966 — a screw-you to Ferrari, which had rebuffed an acquisition attempt — and Bill Ford seems intent on commemorating that mark in style.

Under the hood is a modified version of the 3.5-liter EcoBoost six that powers the road-going GT.

Specific requirements won't be imposed on airlines just yet, and both small-engine and military aircraft won't be covered by the regulations. The EPA is requesting input and information on the proposed findings over the next 60 days, with a public hearing scheduled for August 11th. After that, the EPA will wait for the International Civil Aviation Organization to wrap its internal discussions on carbon emissions in the aviation industry before publishing actual rules, according to The New York Times. That isn't expected to happen until February of 2016. Today's news is similar to the steps taken by the EPA in 2009, when the agency issued a finding that stated that greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles contributed to the air pollution. It's taken years to materialize, but that process is finally resulting in the adoption of greenhouse gas standards for cars and light or commercial trucks. The transportation sector is responsible for roughly one third of total US greenhouse gas emissions according to Christopher Grundler, the director of EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality. Aircraft are responsible for 11 percent of those emissions. Many airlines and airports have already been working on reducing emissions by experimenting with biofuels, using single engines while taxiing (or shutting them off entirely), or shaving weight on everything from the in-flight magazines to the ice in your drink. These types of small changes could already be making an impact. According to the Times report, airlines see a one-ton yearly reduction in carbon emissions for every 5.5 pounds of weight shed. And fuel consumption could be reduced by 18 percent if stop-and-go taxiing was eliminated, according to a study done by NASA at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in 2010. But these reductions might not be enough to account for the steady growth of the aviation sector over the last few years.

As CNN reports, the white 1992 LT1 roadster — the millionth Corvette ever produced — is now running, with its structural damage repaired, although GM says only about 15 to 20 percent of the car has been restored. The process has been complicated, in part, by the fact that many of the men and women who assembled the car had signed their names all over its parts. Their signatures were discovered in April, when the car was first taken apart, and they forced GM to rethink its strategy in order to save all of the parts and preserve their names. ""Risk versus originality."" ""Somebody took the time to write their name on the undercarriage,"" Dave Bolognino, GM's director of design fabrications operations, tells CNN. ""We need to take the time to make sure that we straighten that piece of metal instead of replacing it."" The LT1 was one of eight cars that fell into a sinkhole under the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky, last year, and one of three that were deemed salvageable. GM restored a 2009 ZR1 Blue Devil that fell into the sinkhole last year, while the museum plans to restore a 1962 convertible on its own. The part of the museum where the sinkhole opened is also nearly repaired, with its floor reinforced with micropiles and concrete beams. Underground lights and cameras will be installed to allow visitors to see inside the sinkhole. GM says it expects the LT1 to be restored by Labor Day weekend in early September, but there's still a lot of work to be done. The car sustained significant damage to its paint and rear bumper, which is tagged with several signatures. GM also has to decide whether or not to replace its hood, which Bolognino describes as a question of ""risk versus originality.""

The Chinese company — which has been working on self-driving vehicles for the past few years — first announced it had entered a partnership with BMW in 2014. It seems that collaboration has already paid off: this week, Baidu senior vice president Wang Jin said that his company would launch of a new self-driving car with the German car manufacturer before the end of the year. Baidu is focused more on helping drivers than replacing them Speaking at the China Cloud Computing Services Summit, Jin said that the prototype vehicle would be used to test Baidu's autonomous technology, but will still have a human driver present. For now at least, Baidu's aims are a littler smaller in scope than Google's — where the Californian company wants to remove the human driver completely, Kai Yu, Baidu's head of deep learning, said last year that the Chinese firm was focusing on assisting drivers rather than replacing them. But still, The Guardian notes that Baidu has research efforts that rival Google, conducting extensive studies into artificial intelligence, the technology needed for computer ""vision,"" and the robotics required to make an autonomous vehicle. Last year it also invested $10 million into Finnish mapping company IndoorAtlas, adding its expertise to an existing data-mapping service. While the technology to enable self-driving vehicles is forging ahead, at least in the West, legislation to support their arrival on our streets is lagging behind.

Bunker is the creative director for Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes, and he helped create the streamlined art style for first game, an experience that managed to seamlessly take characters from disparate Disney franchises like Pirates of the Caribbean and Monsters University and reimagine them with a slick, streamlined look that made it feel like they were part of the same world. Now he's done the same thing with Marvel — and he was prepared all along. ""I was hoping for it,"" he says of the chance to work on Marvel characters. ""We were told not to get our hopes up, but even still I just knew that I needed to be prepared for whatever, so we were looking at characters across the gamut that Disney has."" The first Disney Infinity launched last year, with the goal of blending real world toys with a video game. Much like Skylanders, you could buy cool action figures, and then zap them into a video game where you could take them on adventures. But what made Disney Infinity so interesting was its toybox mode, which let you take characters from a range of Disney films and have them together in one virtual space. You could have Jack Sparrow riding on the back of the elephant from Aladdin, while wielding a laser gun from Toy Story and racing against Lightning McQueen. One of the most impressive things about the game was how it remained visually cohesive: all of the characters looked like themselves, but the game had a distinct style that made it feel like they were all part of the same universe. One of the keys to getting the look just right was subtraction. ""If you look at the original Infinity characters, we took a lot of the detail out,"" explains Bunker. ""There was no musculature, they were fairly cartoony."" That technique worked well enough for characters like Rapunzel or Mickey Mouse, but it turns out that it wasn't a great fit for Marvel superheroes. So the sequel involved a slightly different approach. ""We had to put a lot of that anatomy and detail back in,"" says Bunker. Thor or the Hulk just wouldn't look right without bulging muscles, and so the design team had to find a balancing point: beefy enough that the characters remained iconic, but streamlined so that they still fit in with all of the existing Disney characters. (The sequel lets you import characters from the first game, so your virtual toybox can feature Spider-man running alongside Elsa from Frozen.) The process for creating Marvel characters was much the same way as it was for the Disney crew. It starts by gathering lots of reference material; for characters like The Avengers, that means looking at the films, comics, and cartoons that already exist, and then working out how best to incorporate that in the game. Once the basic look is settled on, artists find ways to strip away detail while still keeping the character instantly recognizable. After that, they add small touches, like shoulder or neck joints, to make them feel more toy-like. ""These aren't cartoon characters, they're toys that have come to life,"" says Bunker. Eventually the design is turned into a 3D model, and tweaked based on feedback from animators. Sometimes a design that works great as a physical toy doesn't make for the best video game character, and so the final stages are a back-and-forth process of small changes to make the character work in both realms. It's a process that takes around six months for each character. Luckily, the process was sped up at least a little bit for the sequel, thanks in large part to the success of the original Disney Infinity. ""We really had to sell ourselves,"" Bunker says of the first game. ""There was a lot of concern from a lot of the different film makers and creators of the characters about mashing their characters up together. There was some reluctance at first."" And since Disney is a large company with many divisions, from Pixar to Disney Animation Studios, that meant dealing with approval from many places, which often slowed things down. There was less of that with Marvel Super Heroes, though the development team still worked with, and ultimately earned the approval of, many of the original creators. Famed Marvel artist Joe Quesada even offered a bunch of sketches to help with Thor's design. The switch to Marvel also let the team pull inspiration from a wider range of places. The look for the Avengers set of figures, for example, was based primarily on the comic books, while Spider-man's set was inspired by the Ultimate Spider-man cartoon series. The Guardians of the Galaxy set was based primarily on this summer's excellent live-action film. There's even a new flavor with the sequel, thanks to the addition of playable villains like Venom and Loki, which add a slightly darker feel to the game. The original Disney Infinity featured a small number of bad guys, like The Incredibles’ Syndrome, but with the likes of the violent Ronan from Guardians of the Galaxy, the sequel has a much grittier feel. ""It seemed incomplete to not be able to play as the villains,"" says Bunker, ""especially if you're a fan of collecting these figures."" And those figures are really the highlight when it comes to the designs. While the characters look great in-game, the likes of Iron Man and Groot the sentient tree are particularly striking as physical toys sitting on a bookshelf. They fit seamlessly into the Disney Infinity universe, but also just look like really cool sculpted versions of your favorite superheroes. ""In the end, we want these sculpted figures to be — frankly, as an artist — I want them to be a piece of art,"" Bunker explains. At launch, three different five-piece ""play sets"" will be available, featuring characters from The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Spider-man. The base game will come with three characters — Iron Man, Thor, and Black Widow — with the rest sold separately. The team also has a roadmap for future characters that are in the works like Green Goblin, as well as unannounced stuff that they'd like to tackle after that. While there’s still a lot of work to do within the Marvel universe, Bunker and his team have also been planning for other potential additions to the franchise since the very beginning. ""Of course we were looking at Lucas properties,"" he says of the potential for Star Wars characters to work using the same style. ""In the same way I was hoping we'd get to work on Marvel characters, I think we have a style that accommodates anything that comes our way.""

It's not to brag so much as to explain why buying one of his company's new $249 thermostats is as good of an idea as strapping $26,000 worth of solar panels to your roof. It saves, he says, about as much energy as the solar array by doing a better job at regulating indoor climate controls. Lombard co-founded Ecobee, a Canadian company that made the world's first Wi-Fi-connected thermostat, only to spend the past three years watching the world fawn over its competitor Nest's futuristic design. Today the company is unveiling its answer to Nest, the Ecobee 3. It's a jet-black square with rounded edges that looks like nothing else the company has made before, especially its predecessor: a white box with a touchscreen that Ecobee sold patterned Gelaskin stickers for, basically to hide the thing. By comparison, the Ecobee 3 is something the company wants you to stop and look at each time you walk by it in your house. When it's not showing you the temperature inside your house, it doubles as a weather station, giving you the upcoming forecast. And just like Nest, Ecobee is pitching it as something that does all the scheduling for you, saving time and money in the process. The 3 is the result of a two-year collaboration with Lunar Design, a boutique design group headquartered in San Francisco that has designed everything from Apple's first notebook computer to ice cream scoops. The two companies took all the features from Ecobee's existing model and have constructed a new user interface that looks and functions the same whether you're using it on the wall-mounted thermostat or on your phone. That's not a new idea in the world of apps (or even thermostats), but has resulted in software and hardware that feels like one in the same. The new thermostat uses a capacitive touchscreen, with colored pixels that pop out from a black background as you approach it. Where Nest and Honeywell's Lyric zig with color, Ecobee zagged with dark contrast. Ecobee has also strayed from the idea of a rotating, circular dial, choosing instead a virtual knob that can be maneuvered up or down a track to change the temperature. The same screen then fades to show you things like the local weather forecast, and will let you create and adjust programming schedules. If you're on a tablet or connecting to your thermostat in your browser, you can see this interface and just about every other feature on one screen so you don't have to dig through menus. The new design replaces Ecobee's previous model, the Smart Thermostat. Ecobee still plans to sell its less expensive, $179 Smart Si thermostat, which it introduced two years ago as its entry-level model.   Beyond the redesign, the Ecobee 3's big new feature is that it integrates tiny companion sensors that you can put in every room of your house. Each one tracks temperature and motion, so that the system can adjust for what room you're in, instead of simply sensing where the thermostat is installed. One of these sensors is built right into the unit, and you get another in the box that's powered by batteries, and can be placed on any flat surface, or mounted onto walls. The system works with up to 32 sensors, in case you have a house like Bill Gates. Lombard says this sort of automatic, targeted adjustment is the top thing people have asked for over the years, and results in a better reading of the temperature where people are versus where they drilled something into the wall. ""For a lot of people, that's like their thermostat in their dining room,"" Lombard says. That would be fine if people spent most of their time there, but in reality, they don't. ""Being able to put a sensor into a room that you actually use, and your ability to detect whether people are home or not and turn back your temperature goes up significantly."" That kind of setup is also easier than requiring everyone in your family to run apps on their phones that are tracking where they are, just to help the system out, Lombard argues. The new model also promises an installation that consumers can do themselves. Where previous iterations relied heavily on professional HVAC installers, Lombard says the company wanted this to be something ordinary people could take out of the box and get up and running in 45 minutes or less. ""We tried to go through every step, and determine every time where someone might have gotten confused,"" Lombard says. To aid in that, Ecobee made two changes to keep people from getting tripped up: one is detecting your wiring and automatically configuring its software settings accordingly; the other is including power extender hardware, so that it can be plugged into the furnace in homes where the existing wiring doesn't deliver enough juice. The company used to charge for this part as a $25 add-on, but Lombard says that it was worth adding out of the box for people who didn't have the ideal wiring setup. As for how all this will save on bills, Lombard says it's all about scheduling, and touts Ecobee's technology as the best at doing this. Citing figures from the US Environmental Protection Agency, he says that 80 percent of programmable thermostats go unprogrammed. By comparison, he says, the Ecobee 3 comes with a preprogrammed schedule that it adjusts based on information it gathers from its occupancy sensors and your local weather forecast. The company also gets pricing from local utility companies, and will alert people when they can make adjustments to save money.

Technology shouldn’t be built for its own sake, every company tells us, and must have a purpose that directly addresses the needs of its users. This ambition of purposive design has often been trampled over, however, in the blind pursuit of thinness. As with the megapixel wars of yesteryear, the race to have the thinnest phone has become an exercise in spec sheet obsession. Let’s shave a few millimeters here and cut a couple of corners there and we too can live in the sub-7mm club. I think it’s time we let go of this chronic size insecurity. It’s okay to be thick. The best-loved designs over the history of smartphones have rarely been the thinnest. Whether it’s the Motorola Droid (13.7mm), the Palm Pre (16.9mm), the BlackBerry Bold (10.5mm), the original iPhone (11.6mm), or the Nokia N9 (12.1mm), the classics of the past decade seem decidedly chubby when judged by modern standards. But who’s setting these standards and why? Don’t get me wrong, I know thinner is generally better. Flat LCD screens have revolutionized the concept of the TV from a massive tube to a thing you can hang on your wall. The latest ThinkPads and iMacs are exponentially more portable and desirable than their original models and we’re all benefitting from that. But the threshold of ""thin enough"" for phones was passed long ago. The girth difference between the pillowy N9 and its 8.7mm-thick design descendant, the Lumia 730, is not a meaningful one. Both phones are a pleasure to hold. This would all be quite innocuous if thinness was just an extra layer of custard smothered atop your technology cake, but it all too often comes at a price. Small batteries and compromised cameras are the first victims of the desire for a thinner phone. Or, if the camera doesn’t stink, it’s because it actually protrudes out from the phone’s body, as you’ll find in Samsung’s 6.7mm Galaxy Alpha and Apple’s new iPhones, both hovering at just around 7mm. I’ll let you in on a carefully guarded secret: there’s no real difference between 7mm and 10mm, let alone between 6.7mm and 6.9mm. If only Samsung and Apple could have let their belts out a little, we could now be looking at devices with more cohesive, bulge-free designs and potentially more generous batteries to boot. And let’s face it, an iPhone 6 Plus that was a little thicker on aluminum might not have had to deal with the present controversy about how bendy it is. It’s been two years since Nokia’s chief industrial designer told me that ""thinness isn’t everything."" It’s also been a few months since LG’s lead designer told me that the G3 is thicker than it absolutely needed to be in order to achieve a better fit in the hand. Phone designers get it. I just wonder if phone marketers understand this as well: the slickest looking device may get you more sales today, but the one that feels best will be the foundation of your customer loyalty for the future. Specs matter — and thinness is a great measuring stick for the continuing miniaturization of technology — but they matter in stages. Phone thinness hasn’t been an important factor since the Motorola Razr put everyone’s devices on a diet. There’s a reasonable range of expectations that’s now established, and while you can’t stray too far outside it, the route to being meaningfully innovative really doesn’t require you to be at the cutting edge, either. Everyone should move forward the way Motorola did with the Razr Maxx, which wasn’t shy about bulking up to maximize its battery life.

We’ve traveled across the country to find the people, groups, and companies that are solving America’s problems in new and unconventional ways.  New York City, with its dense population and endless skyscrapers, is notoriously difficult to fight fires in. Firefighters depend on nearly 100,000 hydrants to do their work, but many of these hydrants are in disrepair. Vulnerable to misuse and exposed to extreme weather, the city’s hydrants are decayed, leaking, and corroding.  “There are so many defected hydrants,” says Vincent Dunn, a retired Deputy Chief of New York City Fire Department. “In the ’70s it was so prevalent that we developed a radio signal — 1070. It meant the first arriving engine didn’t have water because of a defective hydrant. Other fire trucks would stretch out hoses and assist the first pumper with water.” But when a fire is blazing, every second spent stretching hoses is a second that could be used to save lives. George Sigelakis, a retired New York City firefighter, understood the need for a hydrant redesign early on in his career. “A hydrant is a lifeline to a firefighter,” he says. “You can have manpower and millions of dollars worth of trucks and equipment, but without water out of a hydrant, you can’t do anything.”  Conventional hydrants are made up of steel, iron, and rubber parts. “In an environment with water, all three of those things don’t hold up over time,” says Sigelakis. Some hydrants are cracked open and tampered with by residents looking to gain respite from the heat, or water to wash their cars. As a result, hydrants are caught in an endless cycle of maintenance. Repainting and repairing costs are in the millions of dollars. “Its a great business for manufacturers who make these hydrants,” Sigelakis says. “They keep selling parts. But, lives are at stake.” Sigelakis decided to reinvent the hydrant, and started conceptualizing a new model in his basement. He deconstructed the traditional hydrant, analyzed it, and developed the next generation of hydrant design: the Sigelock Spartan. Virtually indestructible, the Spartan is made of stainless steel and ductile iron, and covered in a powder coating that makes the design non-corrosive even in the face of storms and salty water. An efficient internal drainage system prevents the damage that freezing water can inflict. The hydrant can be opened within seconds—but only with a special wrench, discouraging tampering. The Spartan is manufactured in Pennsylvania and comes with a fifty year warranty. Despite its benefits, Spartan adoption is slow. “Municipalities have stockpiled parts for years,” says Joseph Kelly, the Senior Operations Officer at Sigelock Spartan. “When we approach them about this new technology, they understand the issues because they work on this everyday. But, they also have a lot of money invested in replacement parts.” There are currently 150 Spartans across a dozen states including Florida and Massachusetts. In New York, installation has so far been restricted to Long Island. “Typically, municipalities buy one or two and put it through its paces for a four-season cycle,” says Kelly. As the Spartan proves itself to be the future of hydrants, Kelly expects sales to improve. “It’s not an overnight process. But, we’re making inroads.”",0.44673834066063367,0.5532616593393663,0.8555650151333759,557,5.2639138240574503,343,6.4606413994169092,0,4,"Design, Tech, Detours"

Evidently, the task proved too difficult. Nvidia acquired Icera back in 2011, and intended to ""engage the smartphone revolution"" in much the same way that Qualcomm is doing now, but its LTE hardware was consistently behind Qualcomm's best and never managed to catch up. The goal of integrating the Icera modems into Nvidia's Tegra processors never fully materialized (other than the unsuccessful Tegra 4i) and this news was only really a matter of time.

In a vote from the area's city council last night, the group decided that LinkedIn and not Google will get the majority of the 2.2 million square foot development. Google had planned a massive, sprawling campus that would be covered in an ultra-thin glass mesh. That looked great in renderings, but the city ended up going with a much more simple and straightforward plan from LinkedIn, giving the company more than two-thirds of the space and leaving Google with the leftovers, reports the Silicon Valley Business Journal. The amount of space Google's getting means it could build just one of the four buildings that were part of the original construction plan. Danish architect Bjarke Ingels from the Bjarke Ingels Group and Thomas Heatherwick of Heatherwick Studio teamed up on the design, which aimed to hide parking lots underground and green up the area with trees and other foliage. Interestingly, the project also sought to mix big parts of Google's headquarters with areas open to the public. As The New York Times notes, LinkedIn's plan was a much more sensible option between the two. For one, it could be done using current construction techniques, whereas Google admitted that some of the ideas it had were not technologically feasible just yet. LinkedIn's plan also promised to diversify Mountain View's mix of local businesses away from Google, a company whose tax revenue its tied to for better or for worse. Google's project was one of the most visually curious designs for a tech redesign a time when just about every big company in the area is trying to reinvent its campus. Facebook recently opened up a new 430,000-square-foot campus in nearby Menlo Park that was designed by architect Frank Gehry and sports the world's largest open floor plan. Apple, meanwhile, is in the midst of constructing its own spaceship-like circular campus in Cupertino to replace the one at 1 Infinite Loop. It's set to open up next year, and promises to house 13,000 of Apple's employees under a single roof. This particular setback doesn't mean Google is done trying to reimagine how its campus of the future will look. SVBJ notes that there are a still few nearby areas close to its existing campus where it might be able to build its glass utopia.

While the company's already decidedly lost its government-level battles, with the feds ruling against its stance on net neutrality and its proposed Time Warner Cable merger, it sounds like Comcast is now waging a ground war, starting with one of the most irksome of its problems: maintenance. The company says it's ""setting a goal to always be on time for customer appointments by Q3 of 2015,"" and investing in training for technicians so they know what they're doing when they get there. If a technician doesn't arrive on time, Comcast says, it'll automatically credit a customer with $20. (The company has offered this before, and it's not clear if the offer is being expanded.) Some of the other changes, according to Comcast, will be happening on the company's technology side: rolling out changes to customer service tools to make calls less painful, and creating a new system to ""simplify billing and create better policies to provide greater consistency and transparency to customers."" Comcast also says it's making new tools to reduce in-store wait times, and bringing a ""tech tracker"" it recently launched in Boston to the rest of the country. Why should anyone believe this will help? Maybe they shouldn't. Comcast has a less than sterling track record when it comes to delivering on promises, especially when it comes to customer service. Last year, the company hired an executive whose entire MO was improving how Comcast is perceived, a change there hasn't been much evidence for yet. Plus, problems with the company extend beyond customers, to how it treats its contractors and employees, not to mention its less than palatable approach to politics. But it's a sign that it wants to improve, if not for moral reasons, at least for business ones. If the company's mega-merger plan was a way to tighten its grip on a customer base, eliminating choice for some consumers, this may be the fall back: help them learn to live with you instead.

The breakdown in negotiations, first reported by Billboard, appears to be over Sony's view that SoundCloud doesn't provide enough options for it to make money off of the music it hosts there.  SoundCloud says it's paid out over $2 million to its partners in less than a year Billboard counts over half a dozen Sony musicians whose music has already been pulled, and it sounds as though more could follow. It's not clear if this is a negotiation tactic or the conclusion of the negotiations, but it perhaps isn't a surprising end result: music labels aren't exactly big fans of ad-supported streaming. ""We are in ongoing conversations with major and independent labels and will continue to add partners to the [On SoundCloud] program,"" SoundCloud says in a statement. SoundCloud says that it's already paid out over $2 million to partners through On SoundCloud, its monetization program. The program was only announced last August, and it's now signed over 100 partners. Sony Music declined to comment. On SoundCloud has introduced ads to the site's music streams, which include audio spots and small popups before tracks begin to play. The ads only play every so often, however, which may be limiting how much revenue SoundCloud brings in and is able to share with labels. SoundCloud also recently announced a partnership with a company that scans for copyright infringement and offers analytics, which could provide another avenue for labels to profit off of SoundCloud. If these negotiations are any sign, it still may not be enough to please the biggest names in music. Getting labels on board would give SoundCloud a lot more popular content to stream, so it's seemingly a bad sign for it — and listeners — that Sony isn't interested. SoundCloud's strength has long been in its community, however, rather than these big artists, though that may not be as exciting when it comes to serving ads.",0.2672317097107445,0.7327682902892555,0.1976662689122283,349,5.0200573065902576,209,5.8133971291866029,0,0,Business

""Accel’s experience backing some of the world’s most iconic technology companies as they built communities around their products will be useful for us as we expand as a platform for innovation,"" said DJI founder and CEO Frank Wang. Accel put in money at roughly an $8 billion valuation, and DJI is in further investment talks which value the company around $10 billion, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. DJI is on pace to double its sales this year, generating around $1 billion in revenue. ""DJI is kicking everybody's ass."" ""DJI is kicking everybody’s ass,"" said Bilal Zuberi, a tech investor who has backed drone makers like CyPhy Works. ""They are the Apple of the space."" DJI isn't just taking the lion's share of the profits. It also resembles Apple in that it offers an attractive and easy-to-use gadget that is difficult to modify when compared to more open and modular systems developed by competitors.  That approach has helped it win over legions of rookie pilots, but made it less of a player in the commercial market for drones, where units need to be customized for specific tasks.   ""It became apparent early on that there were really two types of drone companies,"" said Mike Abbott, a partner at Kleiner Perkins who invested in Airware, a drone startup. The first kind takes a horizontal approach, building software or hardware that can work with any drone. ""Others are looking into a certain vertical, say precision agriculture."" DJI had been a vertical company making drones for aerial photography and video, but the company hopes to use this funding to change that.  ""We aspire for DJI to offer a platform for unbounded creativity and exploration across areas as diverse as filmmaking, agriculture, conservation, search and rescue, energy infrastructure, mapping, and more,"" said Wang. ""You want to be the operating system, not the manufacturer."" The repeated use of the word platform is telling. DJI won't tip its hat completely about future plans, but, reading between the lines, it appears the company would like to not just sell hardware, but to become the backbone that supports new companies and services across the entire drone ecosystem. That has been the mantra pitched by tech investors like Chris Dixon. ""The hardware will be commoditized, and the value will accrue to the best software,"" he told The Verge. ""You want to be the operating system, not the manufacturer."" DJI did release a software development kit when it debuted its Inspire One unit in November of last year. Its investors believe that its combination of hardware and software will make it the front runner in the race to fulfill the booming demand for drones.

Americans understandably take it for granted that if they’re from, say, California and go on holiday in New York, then their Netflix subscription will work just fine when they reach their hotel. But if someone from the UK goes on holiday in Portugal (less than half the distance between Cali and NYC), they'll find themselves locked out of their account, all thanks to the patchwork of European copyright laws, which require Netflix to negotiate rights for its shows one country at a time. This is the sort of problem that EU politicians want to fix. covering everything from parcel delivery to telecoms The way to do this, they say, is by tearing down the digital barriers between the EU’s 28 member states. In plans that have been in circulation for months but were officially announced today, EU politicians laid out 16 key targets to make this happen. These points cover not only video streaming, of course, but touch on everything from cross-border parcel delivery to encouraging continent-wide telecoms companies. The end goal is to enforce a set of regulations that will not only make life easier for the EU’s 500-million-plus population, but also boost the prospects of European tech companies. It's also possible that some US companies will be investigated by the EU in the process — but it's worth remembering that what Americans tend to attack as ""protectionism,"" Europeans are more likely to call ""a level playing field."" Such plans were only really alluded to in the EU's official brief, described as the need to ""comprehensively analyze the role of online platforms"" such as search engines and social media. Such a broad description could cover a variety of actions, but it's previously been reported that this is likely to mean more probes into US tech companies. These probes could include looking at how paid ads appear in search results (something that would be separate to the ongoing antitrust case leveled at Google), how firms look after their customers' data, and whether the regulations governing ""old media"" companies should also apply to the digital new kids on the block. In the case of telecoms, for example, this might mean things like making VoIP services offer emergency calls, just like traditional phone companies do. European tech companies need access to more users if they want to compete For EU politicians, the benefits of the digital single market are clear. The European Commission — the part of the EU responsible for promoting the interests of the European Union as a whole — claims that the digital single market would add  €340 billion to Europe’s GDP and create 3.8 million jobs. The main driver of this growth, say analysts, would be fairly straightforward: extra customers. In the US, startups can hit the ground running, scaling quickly by hoovering up domestic users. But in the EU, companies have to negotiate their way through obstacles like differing tax codes before they can sell their wares to their neighbors. ""The European digital market is still way too fragmented."" ""Too often US companies start investing in London in the hope of later on replicating their approach for continental Europe,"" says Forrester analyst Thomas Husson. ""[But] this rarely happens this way because the European digital market is still way too fragmented."" Removing internal barriers in the EU wouldn't only help European firms, but would also boost their US rivals. After all, if the European Commission had its way, Netflix would only have to sort out licensing in the EU once, for all 28 countries at the same time. Husson notes that the same problems also hamper the growth of European companies within the EU, and points to the example of the telecom industry. Here, the growth of companies like Vodafone, Orange, and Telefonica has mainly come from markets outside of the EU. ""The same could be said for e-commerce,"" he says. However, while bringing some legal uniformity to the EU looks good on paper, it’s hardly an open goal. To return to the example of streaming media again, critics argue that getting rid of geo-blocking for the whole of the EU could actually be harmful. For a start, the current system allows media companies to pick and choose where they promote their content, using a country’s licensing fees to offset the cost of localizing shows or movies (there are 24 official languages in the EU after all). Some EU politicians even believe that Europe’s uneven copyright terrain acts as a natural barrier to foreign invasion. In February, the French government office dedicated to the EU warned that ""overhauling the principle of territoriality […] could lead to the decay of European culture."" Whatever happens next, though, will only happen slowly. Proposals for the digital single market have been under discussion for years, and the EU’s economically and culturally diverse member states mean disagreements are guaranteed to hobble any negotiation. In addition, many of the laws under discussion go ""well beyond economic issues,"" notes Husson. ""This is also a political and societal debate."" Rules about how personal data is handled, for example, are bound to run into trouble when countries like the UK and France continue to demand greater powers of surveillance in the name of security. But with the digital world so intertwined into all of our lives — both in Europe and in the US — no one can deny that these are problems that need tackling.",0.756561836357814,0.24343816364218596,0.8895447509798319,925,5.0281081081081078,489,6.147239263803681,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, US & World, Report"

That happened, of course, but put into question whether the service would be ready to go in time for Apple's annual developers conference. Now the same thing is said to be happening in Apple's effort to revamp its streaming music services in time for its 2015 Worldwide Developer Conference, which is a little more than a month away. Citing sources, Billboard reports that Apple is having troubles getting deals signed with record labels, and that getting everything lined up in time ""is going down to the wire."" It's unclear how many of the labels are holding up the process; last time around it was Sony Music, which was a lone holdout. A source tells The Verge that Apple has not yet signed a deal with Universal Music Group. On Universal's labels are Taylor Swift, Maroon 5, Katy Perry, and countless others. This same thing happened two years ago Apple's been aggressively trying to bargain for firmer footing against entrenched streaming music rivals. As The Verge exclusively reported yesterday, the company has been pushing music labels to end deals with services like Spotify that offer free, ad-supported music when contracts come up for renewal. The move would give Apple's own premium music streaming service a better chance at snatching subscribers away from long-existing services like Rdio and Spotify. At the same time, Apple's bargaining efforts have already managed to attract the attention of both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission over whether what Apple is doing is fair and square. In the case of iTunes Radio, which debuted at WWDC two years ago, Apple didn't have all the labels on board until Friday, the week before the show. Apple was able to show the service off at the June keynote, but it didn't make its way into the hands of consumers until three months later with the launch of iOS 7. The same thing is expected here, as part of a relaunch of the Beats music service, which Apple acquired for $3 billion last year. In the meantime, there have already been some hints of Apple trying to get its ducks in a row for a new music experience. An upcoming version of iOS that's already been in developers' hands sports a revamped Music app. That could just be setting the stage for an integrated version of Beats (which is currently a stand-alone app), or just Apple trying to clean house before pushing something more compelling out the door later this year. Apple's WWDC kicks off June 8th, and is once again being held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Besides the music app, the company is also expected to show off a new version of the Apple TV, iOS, OS X, and a new developer kit for the Apple Watch. Update May 5th, 4:03PM ET: Added details about Universal not having signed a deal yet. Also, 9to5Mac is reporting that the streaming service is set to actually launch at WWDC inside of iOS 8.4 versus as part of the next major iOS release, as well as in iTunes 12.2. Interestingly, the report also claims Apple is attempting to work in unlimited skips for iTunes Radio into its new paid service. Right now, it's limited to six skips per hour, though Apple trims out the ads if you're a paying subscriber of its $24.99-a-year iTunes Match service.",0.3684513940986893,0.6315486059013107,0.8643822320851583,588,4.7244897959183669,321,5.5669781931464177,0,0,"Apple, Business, Tech"

They are incredibly talented dudes, and it's a testament to the kind of work they do that the duo will now craft video for the ""front page of the internet.""

""We’ll be aiming to tell some of the best stories that have happened on the platform and because of the platform."" Reddit has begun to dabble in the dark arts of ""monetization"" In the fall of last year Reddit raised $50 million and went through a number of management shakeups. Co-founder Alexis Ohanian returned as chairman, and Ellen Pao took on the role of chief executive. The company began to talk more seriously about that dreaded next step in any successful social startup's lifecycle: monetization.   Reddit has been advertising against the numerous passionate communities that flock to its forums (subreddits) for a while now, but it's tough to make big money pasting display ads and promoted posts next to a dozen other plain text links. Advertisers are also wary of winding up next to the kind of shocking and salacious material that users submit. Who remembers ""Explain it like I'm five,"" the video series? By creating its own content, Reddit can better control the conversation around the marketing and also tap into more lucrative advertising formats. Video is at the top of that food chain. The company tried its hand at original programming once before, turning the popular subreddit ""Explain Like I'm Five"" into a series. Since then, however, its efforts have been sporadic at best. This time Reddit will focus on its marquee brand, the AMA. ""One of our first projects will be taking the authenticity and connection created by our Ask Me Anything interviews and translating that into video,"" the company said. After that it will look to bring stories from users and forums to life.""Every community and every user has a voice on Reddit; we’re excited to use the power of video to amplify those voices,"" said Oplinger. Despite its massive size, Reddit is still a fairly small company. It's kind of like the Craigslist of content in that way. Its culture impact, however, is vast, generating countless memes, scuttling the best laid corporate plans, and landing AMA interviews with the biggest names in sports, entertainment, and politics.

Der Spiegel says it has filed a criminal complaint with the German Federal Prosecutors office wherein it claims its journalists were the victims of a spying campaign, based on documents it has obtained. At the same time, CNN is also reporting that it has obtained evidence that the US government spied on Der Spiegel. Jake Tapper tells the story of a US official who could have been representing either the CIA or NSA going to the German government's intelligence coordinator, Günter Heiss, and demanding he do something about a deputy (Hans-Josef Vorbeck) who was supposedly leaking information to the press. In response, Heiss reportedly traveled to Washington to discuss the alleged leaks and his government opened a file about ""U.S. protocols of intercepted communications between Vorbeck and journalists."" The incidents took place back in 2011, well before the Snowden leaks revealed the extent of the US government's spying to the world. Vorbeck was apparently reassigned, though at The Intercept reports the alleged reasoning for the reassignment is only now coming to light.

But the US wasn’t alone in having a patriotic party; the Greeks were dancing in the streets on Sunday as well. Greece’s reasons for jubilation are a little more complex than the American ones, but the end result has been a rather similar expression of national unity and self-determination. Sunday’s big event for the Greek people was a referendum asking them whether to accept the latest proposal from the country’s international creditors. Saying “yes” would have secured Greece a fresh tranche of bailout money to keep it from teetering off the edge of economic oblivion, but it also would have accelerated an increase in the country’s pension age and imposed tough new conditions on an already embattled population. Saying ""no,"" more than just the opposite of ""yes,"" would serve as a symbolic defiance of austerity imposed from outside. The Greek people decided, with a clear majority, to reject the proposed bailout. And then they threw a party. Lead photo: PACIFIC PRESS / Getty Images More than anything, the referendum offered a cathartic moment for a country that’s been under economic pressure for over half a decade. Greece has been one of the hardest-hit victims of the global economic crisis of 2008, and is presently deeply indebted to a number of international organizations that have helped it avoid defaulting on its national debt. In order to appease those creditors, the country has already instituted numerous reforms and spending cutbacks, but its new Syriza-led government has spent most of this year locked up in unproductive efforts to renegotiate the terms of its loans. (Photo credit: LOUISA GOULIAMAKI / Getty Images) The European Central Bank, the European Commission, and the International Monetary Fund demand that Greece cuts state spending further and faster, while Greece says it’s got nothing left to cut. Both sides feel like they’re being held hostage by the other, and the whole protracted saga has been a massive frustration and burden for the country’s population. So when an occasion comes when the people can, at least temporarily, throw off the shackles off austerity and say enough is enough, why not enjoy it to the fullest? (Photo credit: LOUISA GOULIAMAKI / Getty Images) No one in Greece is under any illusions about what the referendum decision means for the country’s future. The choice was always a bleak one: accept the onerous conditions of the bailout proposal and suffer, or reject them and suffer a less predictable, but still unpleasant fate. But what’s important about making that choice is that it’s a statement of assertiveness and some small form of self-determination. (Photo credit: MILOS BICANSKI / Getty Images) By exercising their democratic right, the Greek people gain a sense of agency: their future pains will be that little bit easier to overcome because they at least had a say in their country’s direction. All the cheering and flag waving in Athens on Sunday is about this psychological comfort and relief rather than some economic breakthrough. (Photo credit: CHRISTOPHER FURLONG / Getty Images) The crazy thing about Greece’s seemingly perpetual debt crisis is that, even after mobilizing the entire country to make an important decision, it remains an unresolved issue. Will Greece exit the euro currency union? What will its status in the European Union be? Will Greece eventually default on its debts or will a line of extra credit be extended to it even though it rejected the present terms on offer? (Photo credit: LOUISA GOULIAMAKI / Getty Images) None of the big questions surrounding Greece’s future have yet been answered, even though the buildup to the referendum was full of implication suggesting that Greece was, in practical terms, voting on whether to stay in Europe or leave. (Photo credit: LOUISA GOULIAMAKI / Getty Images) The European Central Bank will be meeting today to determine its response to the Greek decision, and eurozone ministers will be holding a similar summit on Tuesday. In reality, then, the entire referendum can be deemed a grandiose negotiation tactic that has served to illustrate the political capital of Greece’s negotiating team and bolster its position. It won’t have endeared the country’s leadership to its creditors — who are already upset about Greece’s historic profligacy and current intransigence — but they don’t necessarily have to be friends to agree to a compromise solution. (Photo credit: LOUISA GOULIAMAKI / Getty Images) Like Cuba in the midst of the Cold War, what happens in Greece has implications spreading far beyond its modest borders. (Photo credit: PACIFIC PRESS / Getty Images) If Greece is allowed to fail, the same threat would loom large over other struggling economies in southern Europe. If it’s cut some slack and helped along, it would encourage a wider rebellion against austerity in those same countries. The way that the Greek domino falls will have widespread consequences, but today isn’t the day we get a conclusive answer. (Photo credit: ANGELOS TZORTZINIS / Getty Images) Sunday’s vote in Greece was the act of a country rejecting austerity, but still clinging on to the euro, saying no to the particular conditions of a loan offer, but still seeking that loan. The situation remains decidedly undecided. But last night democracy had its moment and it was beautiful and happy and united — a small ray of sunshine for a country beset by dark economic clouds.

Penalties include fines and up to two years' jail time The ""Approved Agency"" will work with claimants and web service providers like Facebook, Google, and Twitter to have any offending material removed. After receiving a complaint, companies are supposed to ask the author to remove the offending material. If they don't within 48 hours, the company may simply remove it themselves. Some fear that companies will have little incentive to fight back against claims and will  remove any possibly offensive material without objection — a move that could cut back on free speech.   The law also provides for punishments in the form of fines or jail time. Fines are up to NZ$50,000 (about $33,500) for individuals and NZ$200,000 (about $134,000) for corporations.

The announcers add the extra spice and seasoning that a sizzling encounter needs. The best among them keep us on the edge of our seats in anticipation, and deliver on the hype with erudite insight and undisguised gusto. Basically, the sports commentator is your one buddy that you do actually want to listen to during the course of an important game or match.  For a great many e-sports fans, that buddy is a man named Toby Dawson. Going by the handle of TobiWan, he has been the signature English voice of Valve’s Dota 2 since its modest beginnings as a fan-made Warcraft mod called Defense of the Ancients. Toby was the play-by-play announcer for the first Dota 2 tournament that Valve ever organised — the $1.6 million International in 2011 — and could most recently be heard commentating on the grand finals of this year’s International 5 (TI5, where, contrary to Donald Trump’s contestations that the USA is always losing to China, an American team triumphed over strong Chinese competition to claim the title).  Since the first International, the money in the game has grown exponentially, the teams have turned from groups of friends into professional franchises, and the announcers are all wearing suits and ties now, but Toby hasn’t changed much. He’s still yelling maniacally into the microphone and infecting everyone around him with a boundless enthusiasm. I caught up with him upon his return to Berlin this past week — as he was recovering from the three-week Dota pilgrimage to Seattle that was TI5 — to talk about his path to the top of Dota, and what it takes to become the pre-eminent voice of the game you love. The tale of Toby’s involvement with competitive gaming began in his native Australia around 2003, at roughly the same time as the first Dota mods started emerging. But his gateway drug was actually first-person shooter game Battlefield 1942, which was quickly superseded by the original Call of Duty. Toby quickly progressed from joining Battlefield clans to managing them, and eventually even took over the running of small-scale Call of Duty tournaments. ""I don’t like seeing things being done incorrectly, or not to their fullest potential,"" he says, which is what prompted him to take on the extra responsibilities. After a while, though, Call of Duty 2 showed up and people started transitioning to the newer game, much to Toby’s vanilla-COD-loving chagrin. He hated Call of Duty 2 and hatched up an ingenious plan to keep players interested in his preferred title: commentary. After being rebuffed by local e-sports commentary group Gamestah, Toby set up his own operation and got his first taste of what it was like to record and distribute game commentaries. Bandwidth was expensive and his methods were profoundly amateurish. ""It was possibly one of the worst ways you could have ever recorded an audio file. We used Windows Sound Recorder, where there’s no way to throttle the levels, there’s no way to control it all, and you gotta do it in 10-minute blocks of recording."" Such was the state of technology back in 2005. Predictably enough, he says, the whole thing was a disaster, but the community loved it, and Gamestah quickly rectified its initial error by putting Toby in charge of its Call of Duty section. Only a few months into his job as a volunteer commentator — which he was juggling with a 40-hour work week as a retail manager — Toby got his first opportunity to attend a LAN event, the first tournament where he’d get to commentate live. And it was all a big mistake, he says. Gamestah were preparing to head out to the World Cyber Games in Singapore and they needed someone to cover Dota matches. Toby wouldn’t have made the roster as a Call of Duty commentator, but he had played three (exactly three) games of Dota and knew that it stood for ""Defense of the Ancients"" and that made him the most expert member of the crew. So he went. ""I’d never been to an event where that many people were crazy about Dota or about anything,"" says Toby. Despite the lack of any official developer support, Dota was already massive in Southeast Asia, and its fandom was nothing short of a ""fanatical movement"" in Toby’s eyes. Still, the experience was ""scary as crap"" since he didn’t really know the game, and his personal highlight of the show would end up being when he stepped in for a late-night Call of Duty commentary. Saddled with a disinterested co-commentator on the main stage, Toby took over the entire match and ""got so hyped and made so much noise that people started coming from the lower level up, and actually coming to watch the game."" Toby’s reputation on the Dota 2 scene is built on his ability to hype people up and stir excitement. But the thing that often goes unnoticed is the incredible amount of work he has put in behind the scenes to put himself in that position of hypemaster number one. In the years after the World Cyber Games, things progressed very slowly, with the only highlights being a series of experiments at ""residential hotwiring of rigs"" (including a successful Hackintosh machine) to improve the production quality of the commentary streams. Well, that and a few visits by the police who were called out to quieten down the irrepressible Dota commentator screaming at the top of his lungs while covering European matches in the middle of the Australian night. It wasn’t until 2011 that a serious opportunity opened up in Berlin, where Toby would set up the joinDOTA website under the auspices of Freaks 4U Gaming and turn live streaming and Dota commentary into his full-time profession. Fortuitously, that same year Valve announced its first International tournament would take place at Gamescom in Cologne, and Toby was already the most prolific English-language Dota caster out there. He was in the right country and had all the right qualifications, so Valve handed him the job. All those countless hours toiling away before an audience of mere hundreds paid off in a big way when Toby served as the main English play-by-play announcer at TI1. Dota 2 made its debut at that tournament, and was about to take off in popularity, and Toby was in the perfect position to rise with it. And yet, Toby’s path from The International 1 to The International 5 was not a linear ascent. He earned widespread disapproval for his hubristic conduct during TI2 — demanding control over which games he would commentate on — and had to work hard to reclaim the esteem of the Dota community. ""This is something which every caster goes through at some point, where you believe you’re immortal because there’s a couple of guys who loved what you said, and then there’ll be a couple more guys, and they’ll keep piling up. And you’ll just be sitting there going, ‘I can do anything I want to,’ and you’ll realize very quickly that when you do anything you want to, you will be shut down."" Still, after a contrite climbdown and many months of humble work to rebuild his viewers' trust and favor, Toby earned a second chance from Valve and the community. He’s now back at the top of the commentator hierarchy, emoting every moment of the game with an untarnished zeal. If he was based in Silicon Valley, Toby Dawson might be thought of as a new media entrepreneur. He’s certainly done as much to advance his field as anyone else, whether it be in the methods and machinery of how live commentary broadcasts are made or in stirring and augmenting a community of dedicated gamers and viewers. Game commentary is easy now, at least logistically, exactly because guys like Toby worked out all the kinks and issues during the harder, earlier times. Like most success stories, his is one where hard work and passionate commitment are necessary but not sufficient preconditions, and it took a serendipitous confluence of events to propel him to where he is now.

How do you stay vital when your audience knows all of your tricks? To paraphrase Stephen Malkmus, you can’t quarantine the past — you can accept it and allow it to infuse your work, or you can try to lock it behind a door and move forward. Both paths are viable. Two of the most popular bands in indie rock are releasing new albums this week, and they’re both approaching milestones in their own way. Baltimore dream-pop duo Beach House are releasing their fifth album, Depression Cherry, with the tenth anniversary of their self-titled debut on the horizon; Dan Bejar is releasing his 11th LP as Destroyer, Poison Season, and nearing the 20th anniversary of his ramshackle debut We’ll Build Them a Golden Bridge. These new albums feel like summative assessments Spend enough time with them, and Depression Cherry and Poison Season start to feel like summative assessments: they’re snapshots of two bands nearing career checkpoints, reflecting on their work, and attempting to chart a course forward. But even though they treat their work with the same level of conceptual heft, their discographies reflect two very different approaches to creativity and careers in music. (Sub Pop) Alex Scally and Victoria Legrand bubbled up out of Baltimore’s fertile music scene as Beach House in the mid-’00s, and they’ve stayed within the same narrow sonic lane since. They’re the acknowledged contemporary masters of dreamy indie pop, and they build all of their songs around the same two hooks. There’s a searching, cycling melody, played on Scally’s guitar or a keyboard of some sort; there’s a commanding yet ethereal vocal from Legrand, like Stevie Nicks cloaked in a thick layer of mist. The guaranteed presence of these two qualities gives you the feeling all of their albums could blend into one after just a bit of knob-twiddling: tweak the fidelity, the scale, and the mixing, and the last decade could be one giant brick of music. Their songs are heat-drunk, sensual, and stained with a touch of mysticism. Imagine staying up past midnight and creeping into your parents’ attic, not to make out, but to fiddle with a Ouija board by candlelight. That’s the sound of Beach House’s best work.   No Beach House album is drastically different from the next, but the band experienced a small shift around the turn of the decade. 2010’s Teen Dream elevated them from an indie curiosity into one of the most popular rock-adjacent bands working; 2012 follow-up Bloom debuted in Billboard’s top 10 albums. Their sound grew with their sales and prominence, helped along by length and live drums; Legrand had always been a strong presence, but she transformed into a true force, earthy and fierce. Depression Cherry is the sound of the band hitting the reset button. Their new songs are smaller, tighter, and more focused on tone than power; the live drums are largely gone. (The band said as much in a press release announcing the record.) Legrand has cut back from full blast, and she’s a livelier presence for it: she dabbles in spoken word, gains some agility, sounds curious and dreamy and dewy in equal measure. It marks a return to the ethos that defined their earliest music with much greater clarity and skill. The band sounds newly confident and cinematic And as a conscious reflection on the work they’ve done before, it’s not innovative — but that’s also not the point. Songs like grand opener ""Levitation"" and sweeping waltz ""PPP"" are familiar, but they’re newly confident and cinematic; they make you appreciate the band’s ability to iterate on a few key sounds and themes over and over again without compromising their potency. They invite you to recognize the value of consistency, of predictability, of routine excellence. (Merge) Those are exactly the sorts of values that must make Dan Bejar’s skin crawl. Bejar is an advocate for stylistic breadth, a walking thesaurus, a wine-sipping raconteur; the only constant in his work is change. A scrappy, witty singer-songwriter from Vancouver, Bejar’s first work of real note was 2001’s jaunty Streethawk: A Seduction, a rip through the music of the British Invasion that name-checked Werner Herzog and Farrar, Straus and Giroux alike. He’d also joined Canadian-American supergroup The New Pornographers by that point, emerging as that group’s dashing, roguish gem thanks to contributions like ""Jackie"" and ""Breakin’ the Law."" From there his restless spirit took hold, and he spent the next decade exploring the possibilities of ""indie rock"" at its most loose. Your Blues was a startling detour into MIDI orchestration, a whirl of processed flutes and chintzy fake horns; Destroyer’s Rubies was a course correction into rambling, self-referential rock, like Bruce Springsteen stumbling through the looking glass. (A typical highlight is ""Looters’ Follies,"" wherein Bejar takes a moment at the song’s peak to note the song itself has never sounded so good. And he’s right!) No one could’ve predicted the journey’s end: Bejar became a minor star. Released in 2011, Kaputt took the coke-crusted perfectionism of Steely Dan’s Gaucho and updated it for listeners still coasting on chillwave’s good vibrations. It became Bejar’s most popular and acclaimed album yet. Bejar reacts to success the same way he'd react to a noble flop Poison Season makes it clear that Bejar reacts to meteoric success the same way he’d react to a noble flop: by moving forward. It’s not antagonistic or anti-commercial, but it’s deliberate, pompous, and unfocused. Bejar flips between muscle and fussiness once or twice a song. His writing is moodier and the hooks are less evident; he sounds like a weary traveller flipping through a passport rather than a caustic bon vivant. This is an album that takes languor to its logical extent, which is saying something given Bejar recorded many of the vocals that made up Kaputt while lying on his couch. How does the past figure into a reactionary effort from an artist for whom stylistic shifts are the norm? It creeps in slowly over time, the album’s songs bending like a rotten plank of wood. Listen enough, and you can start to imagine a song like ""The River"" rendered several different ways depending on your chosen phase of Bejar’s career: heart-on-sleeve songsmith, MIDI technician, wine-drunk romantic, louche synth hound. (In the case of ""Archer on the Beach,"" no imagination is required — a completely different version recorded pre-Kaputt is included on a 2010 EP.) It’s a phenomenon that renders Poison Season less an album and more an exercise in futility. Beach House looked back at their career and built on it; Bejar tried to outrun it, and it wriggled its way in anyway. It’s possible that music’s streaming age is devaluing the relationship between an artist’s new work and their discography. When a listener can plow through a decade or two of music in a few hours without any kind of significant investment, why make a parallel investment in examining your new album’s link to the past? Give people a few new songs and let them make their own connections — everything you’ve ever recorded is a click or two away anyway. The argument is one for quality, and it’s one that’s reflected in the gap between Depression Cherry and Poison Season. The former is more fulfilling as both a piece of music — more cohesive, more dramatic, more pleasurable on a minute-by-minute basis — and as a new piece in the band’s larger mosaic. It’s an element of satisfaction derived from the band’s thoughtful consideration of where they are now and what they’ve done before. At some point, you have to reckon with your past This leads to an interesting emergent point. Beach House and Destroyer represent nearly three combined decades of experience and two entirely different approaches to an artist’s body of work, but their new albums end up saying the same thing: once you reach a certain stage in your career, you have no choice but to reckon with your past. You can focus on moving forward or you can stare it in the face and reflect with intent, but you’re never going to escape the ghosts of everything you’ve done before. And if that’s true, you might as well take the latter approach: it’s going to lead to more gratifying, enjoyable work.",0.8298374689650054,0.17016253103499457,0.5787299726895944,1447,5.0456116102280584,760,6.4223684210526315,0,4,"Culture, Entertainment, Music, Music Review"

The medium is positively glutted with shows that each, in their own way, bear a passing resemblance to the likes of Law and Order and CSI. But early last year, HBO’s True Detective created a renewed appetite for thoughtful and dark crime TV, and when this summer’s second season turned out to be a mind-bending bore, viewers’ thirst for a murky crime underworld was left unquenched.   Enter Narcos, Netflix’s latest original series — and the service's first big dramatic swing since the Wachowskis’ polarizing Sense8. Led by executive producer and director José Padilha (2014's RoboCop), the series tracks the rise and fall of ""King of Cocaine"" Pablo Escobar, and the bloody drug war between the American Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Colombia’s notorious Medellín Cartel. A well-crafted blend of The Wire and Goodfellas, Narcos takes an unflinching look at one of the War on Drugs’ single most violent conflicts. It’s Netflix’s next great show, making the case that, as the streaming service aims to expand into 200 countries through next year, its international ambitions are worth the effort. Our first tour guide into the world of Narcos is DEA agent Steve Murphy (Boyd Holbrook), who provides affably unhurried narration throughout the series. This is far from the first time we’ve heard this story (see: Traffic, Blow, and Killing Pablo, to name a few), but we’re quickly brought up to speed: in the 1970s, drugs poured onto American streets thanks to the expert smuggling efforts of the narcos, or Latin America’s elite drug traffickers. Cocaine, in particular, was a gold mine, quickly growing into a $50 billion a year industry. But that growth also killed thousands, whether it was through the policies of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, the numerous disappearances at the hands of the cartels, or the wanton demand for the drug itself that killed users and smugglers alike. Murphy is our window into this world, and early on in Narcos' 10-episode first season, it’s easy to assume that he’s the star of the show — the All-American good guy from Miami who steps into the drug war out of a sense of duty. But it doesn’t take long before the show begins subverting those assumptions, turning its gaze to the cartel and the series’ excellent Spanish-speaking cast. Game of Thrones alum Pedro Pascal plays Murphy’s partner Javier Peña, a Mexican DEA agent who was instrumental in bringing Escobar down. Elsewhere, Stephanie Sigman (soon to be the latest Bond girl in the upcoming Spectre) plays Valeria Velez, a character based on reporter Virginia Vallejo who struck up an affair with Escobar at the height of his influence. Much of the dialogue is subtitled Spanish, making Colombia and its people the focus of the story. It’s a refreshing move for Netflix, though it may put off old-school Miami Vice fans who expect their gangsters to speak in Spanish-accented English. However, no performance surpasses Wagner Moura’s (Elysium) as Pablo Escobar himself. Moura, who last worked with Padilha on Brazilian megahit Elite Squad and its sequel, is both menacing and charismatic as the head of the Medellín cartel. During one early confrontation with Colombian authorities, he intimidates an official blocking his way by naming the officers under his thumb and the family members he’s clearly willing to kill. ""Plata o plomo,"" (""Silver or lead"") he intones, a phrase used by cartels to this day to enforce cooperation with bribes or blood. Moura is truly scary in the role, but also likable. He turns Escobar, an already outsized figure in Colombian history, into something of a South American Tony Soprano. Moura’s Escobar might even be the kind of supervillain worth rooting for if not for our historical knowledge of how much killing he actually accomplished during his reign. And to its credit, Narcos never shies away from the fact that, despite its being a dramatized account of narcoterrorism in the 1980s with gratuitous sex scenes befitting any premium TV outing, untold thousands died during this period. The series makes frequent use of news footage to show the Medellín cartel’s victims, which included many prominent politicians and judges. It’s here that the show becomes an indictment of the War on Drugs itself: the United States is implicated in the rise of Escobar, having ignored cocaine’s presence in the country for years. It was the cartel’s growing economic might, not concern for what drugs were doing to its cities, that finally drew the US into the conflict. And the war that raged on for more than a decade did little to address the drug’s demand — money going into public health policy and drug education was negligible by comparison. Narcos ends far before it's finished telling Escobar’s whole story, so if it's renewed, there’s still a great deal to look forward to. Escobar was a villain of mythic proportions. A self-made man from modest means, he built a massive drug empire while simultaneously nurturing dreams of becoming president of Colombia. He fashioned himself into a Robin Hood figure who earned the adulation and respect of the poor — even as he employed their children in his criminal activities. He’s as complex as he is compelling, so it’s no wonder why so much has been written and filmed about him since his death in 1993. Narcos is excellent, the kind of crime drama Netflix can use to draw eyeballs away from HBO and the stalwarts running on CBS and NBC. It’s also proof that, where the service’s first ambitious effort in Marco Polo failed, new outings like Sense8 and Narcos are clearing a path for quality shows for international audiences. The ‘80s drug wars are certainly well-trod territory, but Padilha and crew have taken a familiar subject and breathed new life into it. Hope you don’t mind subtitles.

As of today, Google is promoting the intersection of the two with YouTube Gaming, a dedicated site and separate app that's supposed to directly compete with Twitch's popular streaming platform. YouTube Gaming is a more obviously gaming-focused version of the standard interface; the announcement post billed it as a place where ""you can search with confidence, knowing that typing 'call' will show you Call of Duty and not 'Call Me Maybe.'"" In practice, the problem YouTube Gaming needs to solve isn't separating video games from Carly Rae Jepsen (who has a small but respectable place in its search results, thanks to a Just Dance 4 track and some Minecraft parody songs.) It's separating the different kinds of gaming content that's easily available on YouTube. And in that, it succeeds — which might be all it needs to do. While you're watching a stream, YouTube Gaming looks more like a Netflix-style video service (or YouTube's mobile app) than its vanilla counterpart does, though the components are similar: you can see comments on the side, give a streamer a thumbs-up or thumbs-down, and subscribe to their work.  The real difference is organization. It's possible to look for live content, or gaming content, on YouTube, but narrowing it down from there involves either searching for exact terms, cycling through some broad categories, or clicking randomly. In YouTube Gaming, there's a list of trending games down one side, and ""featured"" channels down another. There are landing pages for specific games, dividing their results into categories like pre-recorded ""let's play"" videos, popular videos, and live shows. This obviously works best for things that people are actually playing, but you'll also find pages for obscure 20-year-old adventure games starring Grace Jones, as long as there are videos about them on YouTube.  While the difference between YouTube Gaming and Twitch isn't all that pronounced on Android, YouTube unsurprisingly looks much slicker (and well-organized) than Twitch on desktop. It also does a fairly good job of culling non-gaming content from its library, even if it's also possible to pull up, say, ominous political videos about Zbigniew Brzezinski.  But the interface isn't what will sell most people on YouTube Gaming. If it can poach users from Twitch, it will be through video reliability and, as my colleague Vlad Savov pointed out earlier this month, benefits like being able to ""rewind"" a stream that you've missed the beginning of. It will also, however, have to build the kind of live event following that will keep people coming back. Right now, Twitch's most popular channel is drawing around 32,000 viewers, while YouTube's top featured channel has around 11,000 — which probably includes a first-day rush of people just trying out the service, since it's playing on the front page. Professional ""let's play"" artists like PewDiePie are already an integral part of the YouTube ecosystem. As Vlad said, though, people don't think of YouTube first and foremost as a live-streaming destination, and until now, there was no equivalent experience to visiting the front page of Twitch and clicking around to see what's happening right now. If you already know exactly what you want on YouTube, YouTube Gaming is just another wrapper for that. But for anyone else interested in live games, this makes things the service can already do more accessible. And for anyone who's not interested in games at all, it's enough to make you wonder if similar rebranding efforts might be coming to Google's other live-streaming categories.",0.5700761289519278,0.42992387104807217,0.6459689236577203,597,5.1457286432160805,348,6.0517241379310347,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Hands-on"

The iPad Pro sits so distinctively between the boundaries of tablet and laptop that it makes it a hard device to compare. Sure, it's probably fair to call it more tablet than laptop, but it's also competing with the Surface Pro, which is more laptop than tablet. Apple even says that the iPad Pro is using a ""desktop class"" processor. It's living in a very strange and very interesting space in the tech world that gives it a lot of advantages, like versatility, and a lot of disadvantages, like actual power. So how does it actually compare? In the chart below, we put the iPad Pro up against some of its closest competitors. On the one side, that's other tablets — the iPad Air included. On the other side are laptops like the MacBook and, arguably, the Surface Pro. Specs alone can't explain how you're supposed to use these devices, but they paint a useful picture of exactly what the iPad Pro should be able to accomplish.   Correction: The Surface Pro 3 is sold with a stylus; this chart previously listed it as optional. This chart also misidentified the Surface 3's resolution as 1920 x 1080; it is 1920 x 1280.

Apple brought Microsoft's Kirk Konigsbauer on stage to demonstrate how Office apps would work on the iPad Pro. For the most part, there's nothing unexpected here — Office for iPad is already a powerful and good looking suite of apps; now they're just optimized for the iPad Pro's larger screen. Office is also going to be supporting Apple's new stylus, the Apple Pencil.  Microsoft's strategy is all about offering apps everywhere Given Microsoft's newfound focus on providing apps and services across all platforms, the collaboration makes a lot of sense. Microsoft's goal is to make the best apps it can and to get as many people using them so that it can sell them some of its more specialized services. Office has long been the go-to suite of productivity tools, and — while they debuted on the iPad a bit late — Microsoft is still pushing for Office to take that role in the tablet world as well. So far there's no obvious winner in the tablet productivity world, and having a great choice will be important once the iPad Pro is released. The demo also emphasizes just how much the iPad Pro will be going up against the Surface Pro. The iPad Pro offers a stylus and keyboard case, which makes it a competing, high-end laptop / tablet. With Office — one of the most important desktop apps — available on it, Microsoft is giving iOS users one less reason to move over to Windows. That may be fine by Microsoft's own strategy — services first, after all — but it certainly wouldn't mind selling more hardware. Apple also brought Adobe up on stage to demonstrate a new app called Adobe Fix. Another company, 3D4Medical, also demonstrated a medical app. Update September 9th, 7PM ET: Microsoft has gone on to detail the enhancements to Office for iPad on its blog. The updates focus on features that allow Office apps to take advantage of iOS 9's multitasking; support is also being added for the iPad Pro's stylus.

Apple is empowering its personal assistant, beefing up its capabilities in iOS 9 and today during its iPhone Event, it made Siri the centerpiece of its brand new Apple TV, and its main input device. The new Apple TV comes with universal voice search, powered by Siri. iTunes, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Showtime — it can all be searched by just saying the name of a movie, director, or actor. The new remote comes with a built-in Siri button, which you can use to say things like ""what did they say?"" which will rewind back 15 seconds on the video you're currently watching. Voice search looks to be the main way to navigate Apple's newest set-top box, which other set-top makers like Amazon, Roku, and even Comcast are also doing.   Siri also received a huge upgrade in iOS 9, gaining the ability to look deeper within apps, analyzing your calendar email, and contacts, and figuring out which apps you use the most — and at what time — to provide you proactive recommendations. And on the new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, Siri is always on, ready to work for you anytime you say ""Hey Siri."" (On current iOS devices, Hey Siri only works when the device is plugged in to a charger.) The dramatic improvements to Siri are a direct and long-awaited strike at Google Now and Microsoft's Cortana, which have become core parts of their respective company's consumer product lines.

(Missing are forward and rewind controls, but presumably that's all done through the touch-sensitive surface now.) The Apple TV can control power and volume over HDMI-CEC, which means that it'll be able to control many televisions on the market right through the HDMI connection. The remote is actually a pretty big deal: the outgoing remote has been an ultra-simple unit that's been kicking around for a long time, while the new one is an ultra-capable unit that lets you interact with the set-top in a variety of ways.

The long-awaited overhaul to Apple's living room set-top box is here. Today the company is unveiling its latest Apple TV with a revised physical design, faster internals, updated remote, and key new features including a built-in App Store. ""It's the golden age of television,"" said CEO Tim Cook. ""Our vision for TV is simple and perhaps a little provocative. We believe the future of television is apps."" The new Apple TV is much more powerful than its predecessor, which is a crucial upgrade for the device’s gaming ambitions. It's powered by a 64-bit A8 processor and supports 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0. ""It's just 10 millimeters taller,"" than the previous device, said Apple's Eddy Cue. As for connections, the new Apple TV carries over the same, simplistic power / HDMI / ethernet setup as the old model. It will launch in late October in two configurations: 32GB for $149 or 64GB for $199. With the newly built-in app store, Apple and third-party developers will expand Apple TV's software ecosystem and widen its core functionality to put a much bigger emphasis on gaming. ""When you consume this way, you realize just how much better it can be,"" Cook said. This is the next step in Apple's attempt to own the living room, and arrives ahead of the company's own internet TV subscription service, expected to arrive sometime in the next year.   You interact with the new Apple TV using Siri, Apple's personal assistant technology. Similar to other set-top box makers like Roku and Amazon, Apple has embraced voice search as the primary means of finding content to watch. Apple's universal search can browse multiple video services (iTunes, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Showtime) for the shows and movies you're looking for. You can search for titles, actors, genres, and even granular criteria like guest spots or cameos on TV shows. Siri can also make content suggestions for general questions like, ""What are some new movies that are good to watch with kids?"" Along with the deep voice search capabilities, Apple is bundling a new and vastly improved physical remote with the latest Apple TV. The remote features a touch surface for easier navigation through the device's user interface, which resembles the previous menu system but is now refreshed and much more in line with modern iOS devices. Apple says the new software is called tvOS. As you watch shows and movies, Siri can also provide current weather conditions or keep you updated on sports scores.   But third-party apps are by far the biggest addition to this new Apple TV. The bundled remote can be used to control games running on your TV screen. On stage, Apple showcased a few titles including Crossy Road and Beat Sports, a game made by Harmonix. Apple's gaming push seems tailored around casual players — the same people who've collectively downloaded millions of titles onto their iPhones and iPads. But apps extend beyond gaming and other sources for video streaming. Apple also brought companies like Gilt on stage to demonstrate how consumers will be able to shop directly on Apple TV. In this way, Apple TV will offer much broader functionality than similar living room devices from Roku or Amazon, which stick largely to entertainment.   But there'll be plenty of that on Apple TV, of course, with Apple also giving stage time to MLB.TV and NHL Game Center; apps can offer push notifications and take you right into a critical moment of a live sports game. The revamped Apple TV has been rumored for months, and after reportedly delaying a WWDC announcement earlier this year, Apple set today's September 9th event as the new reveal target.

Health officials believe the woman was exposed to the measles virus while staying at the Clallam County health facility, during a time when another patient also contracted the disease. The woman, whose name has not been released, had a number of other undisclosed medical conditions at the time and was taking medications that suppressed her immune system.

Many parents believe that some vaccines lead to the development of autism in their kids — a link that has never been proven with science. Yet herd immunity — when a large majority of the population is immune to a disease — is necessary in order to prevent the spread of measles. To enforce this protection, politicians are starting to crack down on anti-vaxxers.

He was addicted to heroin at the time, and had just been arrested for possession in his hometown of Tver, Russia, about 100 miles north of Moscow. Police ordered him to undergo tests for HIV, tuberculosis, and hepatitis C, like all arrested drug users in Russia. Now, on the other end of the phone, came the verdict. “They called and said ‘You are HIV positive, please come in and we will give you information,’” Malyshev says over the phone, his girlfriend translating from Russian to English. It felt like a death sentence. Antiretroviral therapy could prolong his life, but for convicted drug users in Russia, it was all but impossible to access. Doctors gave him two or three years to live.   But Malyshev was lucky. After checking in and out of government treatment centers, where he was forced to undergo excruciating, cold-turkey detox, he found one of the few NGOs that could help. The Moscow-based Rylkov Foundation connected him with a private, less brutal rehab facility in a different region, and pushed him to undergo ARV therapy. These days, the 38-year-old works as an outreach coordinator for the NGO, providing clean syringes and counseling to other drug users. Malyshev knows he’s fortunate, because so many of his drug-using friends were not. “There are not so many stories like Maxim’s,” says Asya Sosnina, Malyshev’s girlfriend. “[His friends] just die, or go to prison.” Maxim Malyshev (center) hands out clean syringes for the Rylkov Foundation in 2014. (Image courtesy of Maxim Malyshev) That’s the fate that awaits thousands of HIV-positive people today in Russia, where an accelerating AIDS crisis is expanding beyond the stigmatized communities of needle-sharing drug users, putting millions of lives at risk. HIV infection rates have steadily declined across much of the world, but Russia is one of the few countries where they’re rising. Experts lay much of the blame on the Russian government, pointing to its longstanding ban on methadone (a proven treatment for heroin addiction) and firm resistance to sex education. With President Vladimir Putin continuing to push a nationalistic, socially conservative agenda, the crisis seems poised to get even worse. In May, Vadim Pokrovsky, the head of Russia’s state-run AIDS organization, told AFP that the country’s HIV epidemic has worsened dramatically in recent years, warning that at least 2 million people will be infected with the virus within the next five years. Pokrovsky added that there are now around 930,000 Russians infected with HIV, citing official statistics, of which 192,000 have already died. The latest tally of HIV-infected Russians — which experts describe as an underestimate — is up nearly twofold from the 500,000 people reported in 2010. Pokrovsky blamed the spike on the Russian government’s increasingly conservative policies on drug treatment and sex education. Injection drug users comprise around 60 percent of Russia’s HIV-positive population, but opiate substitution therapies like methadone remain illegal, despite widespread evidence of their effectiveness. And under the strong influence of the Russian Orthodox Church, Russian schools continue to prioritize abstinence and ""traditional"" values over prevention-based sex education. ""Instead of distributing condoms we should be promoting sexual fidelity and healthy families,"" Lyudmila Stebenkova, the head of Moscow’s health committee, said following Pokrovsky’s comments last month, ""That is much more effective."" But activists say that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s socially conservative, nationalist agenda has masked the reality of the country’s epidemic. ""The [health] ministry prefers to say that the epidemic is under control, and because of Russia’s high morality and Christian orthodoxy, we are protected from everything,"" says Anya Sarang, co-founder of the Rylkov Foundation. ""The ministry just lies about it."" Experts say Putin's nationalist, conservative agenda has only worsened Russia's HIV crisis. (Kremlin.ru) Russia’s HIV epidemic has its roots in the early 1990s, when the Soviet Union dissolved and heroin began flowing in from Afghanistan. The virus spread rapidly among sex workers and needle-sharing drug users, but it has since expanded to broader populations. Young women are seen as the primary new group at risk. At first, Russia’s clean needle exchange programs were financed by the Global Fund, an NGO that fights against the spread of AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. But the country announced a withdrawal from the Fund in 2010 (primarily over international guidelines on needle exchanges), and funding for those programs has evaporated. Clinics are barred from providing methadone, a substitute drug that helps wean patients off heroin, despite it being included on the WHO’s list of essential medicines. Those who use or distribute it face up to 20 years in prison. Instead, many addicts, like Malyshev, are arrested and sent to state-run detoxification centers, where they are forced to go through withdrawal with the help of only sedatives. There are some private rehabilitation centers, but the costs are prohibitive for most users. Those who are arrested or quit the detox program early are automatically added to an official registry of drug users, which makes it difficult to obtain a job or receive a loan. That alone deters many from seeking treatment in the first place. ""I think you could probably point to Russia as a worst-practice for virtually every aspect of how to respond to an HIV epidemic concentrated among drug users,"" says Daniel Wolfe, director of the International Harm Reduction Program at the Open Society Foundations, the George Soros-funded NGO. Experts point to Crimea as a tragic case study. When Russia annexed the region from Ukraine in 2014, it swiftly ended opioid substitution therapy at drug rehab centers. Of the 805 addicts who had been receiving methadone, between 80 and 100 died, the UN’s AIDS envoy told journalists earlier this year. Most of those deaths were by suicide or overdose. Russian doctors largely dismiss methadone and other substitution therapies, saying they only replace one addiction with another. ""When an addict comes — along with her children — to a center where she can get methadone, I feel that this is wrong and hypocritical,"" Elena Sokolchik, the head doctor at the Moscow Research and Practical Centre of Narcology, told the BBC. ""I don't want a kid to see addictive drugs distributed as if they were medicines."" (Spencer Platt / Getty Images) Chris Beyrer, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University who has worked extensively in Russia, says this bias dates back to the 1970s, when the US began using methadone to treat soldiers coming back from the Vietnam War. The Soviet Union opposed it on anti-American, Cold War principle — a mentality that has seen a resurgence under Putin’s nationalist agenda. ""They’re not a part of the modern evidence-based movement in medicine,"" Beyrer says. ""Their medical care, their health care, is shockingly bad and bizarre."" Experts say this approach ignores the overwhelming scientific evidence in favor of substitution therapy. While methadone is addictive, it has proven effective when administered in controlled settings. In Ukraine, methadone clinics have been credited with reducing the rate of HIV infection. Across the border, they’re non-existent. ""It doesn’t make sense to anybody, and it’s not a good idea to try and ascribe rationality to this,"" says Beyrer, head of the HIV epidemiology and prevention science program at Johns Hopkins. ""It’s a bias, and it’s a very irrational one."" Russia has made notable progress in providing ARV drugs to treat HIV, and allocated $375 million this year to fighting the virus. But only $3.5 million has been devoted to prevention and awareness, leaving organizations like the Rylkov Foundation to pick up the slack. That’s become increasingly difficult without government support, and amid a climate in which drug users are seen as criminals, rather than victims. ""I have had conversations with Russian government officials who have said things like ‘AIDS and drugs will solve each other,’"" Wolfe says. ""So I think there’s some question about whether or not Russia is actually committed to protecting the lives of everyone, or whether drug users fall into the category of ‘socially unproductive citizens’ [whom] the state might just as well do without."" In some cases, the government has actively sought to muzzle organizations that promote anything other than approved HIV treatments. Sarang says her foundation’s site was shut down in 2012 for publishing documents on the efficacy of opioid substitution therapies, which the federal drug control service labeled as ""drug propaganda."" They eventually moved the site to an American host and appealed to international organizations to draw media attention to the shutdown, but others have been forced to shut down. ""We’re probably one of the few remaining activist organizations in Russia that are still active, because of the government oppression,"" she says. International organizations have been caught in the crackdown, too. The Russian government has forced many to register as ""foreign agents"" — a term synonymous with espionage — subjecting them to arbitrary inspections and warnings. As Russia continues to sever ties with the West, the fear is that it will only be more difficult to monitor its HIV epidemic. ""I think it’s fair to say that they now have a widely disseminated epidemic,"" Beyrer says. ""And if there were new outbreaks, I don’t know how we would know that."" Malyshev agrees that it’s become more difficult to do his job in recent years, but he declines to speculate on how the climate may change in the future. ""It’s very hard to make [a] prognosis,"" he says. ""Because the last two years in Russia, [many] unexpected things happened. I just live for today.""

NASA and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, really need the mission to go well, because they’re running out of ways to restock the station. Typically, a Progress launch doesn’t get much attention; it’s a routine method for resupplying the ISS. But numerous resupply missions have failed within the past year. On Sunday, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket disintegrated en route to the station with supplies in tow. The company is still trying to determine what went wrong. And in April, a Progress spacecraft failed to reach the ISS after launching into orbit. Once in space, it ceased communications with ground control and started spinning wildly out of control. Roscosmos attributed the failure to a flaw in the linkage between the Soyuz and the cargo capsule. NASA really needs the mission to go well That means the ISS astronauts haven’t received any new supplies since April 14th, when SpaceX launched its sixth commercial resupply mission to the ISS. The station has enough supplies to last until the end of October, NASA says. Yet if this mission doesn’t pan out, then NASA and Roscosmos have cause to worry. The loss of this Progress would place a significant amount of pressure on the next scheduled resupply mission — the launch of the Japanese HTV spacecraft in mid-August. That one is already crucial, since it will be carrying water for the crew as well as food. If the HTV spacecraft fails to make it to the ISS, NASA administrators may have to start thinking about the logistics of evacuating the station. At a press conference following the SpaceX failure, ISS Program Manager Michael Suffredini noted that the space agency will give strong consideration to a station evacuation if ISS reserves drop to 45 days worth of supplies. Chances are it won’t come to that. There is another Progress launch scheduled for September 21st, and two crewed missions will launch before that, which may have room for some supplies. If evacuation does occur, however, it would be the first time since 2000 that the station doesn't have a crew onboard. Watch the launch of ISS Progress 60P at 12:55AM EDT Friday.

But according to The New York Times, its aims aren't limited to the US: its lobbying campaign for tobacco actually stretches worldwide.  Helping American tobacco by lobbying abroad The group, the US Chamber of Commerce (which sounds a lot like — but is very much not — the federal Department of Commerce), says that it represents the interests of businesses small and large in DC. It obviously does a lot more. Emails and other documents reported on by the Times show how the trade group is confronting individual countries as anti-smoking regulations arise. The Chamber approached at least seven countries, including Nepal, Uruguay, and the Philippines, over issues ranging from increased cigarette taxes to public smoking bans. Its argument is that a country's economy could suffer if the tobacco industry is harmed, but the Times says that the group's broader goal seems to be putting more money in its members' pockets. It reportedly spends more money on lobbying than any other US interest group, though that money is likely divided among other issues. The Chamber's goals very clearly go against global tobacco-reduction objectives. Around 170 countries have approved tobacco-control measures as part of a World Health Organization public health treaty. The US has its own goals, which include reducing tobacco usage by adults and teens, establishing new state laws prohibiting smoking in public areas, and increasing tobacco taxes. It's a pretty critical public health goal — the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that about one in five American deaths each year is due to cigarette smoking — but the Chamber of Commerce appears to be interested in fighting it back in countries where the laws are still strengthening, seemingly so that the US tobacco industry can remain strong. That anti-regulatory approach seems to be losing the Chamber some big fans, including Apple and Nike. The Times reports that both companies left the trade group in 2009 over its opposition to preventing climate change through emissions regulations. However, several other large companies — including some that you might not expect to take part in those group — remain members. That reportedly includes Google and Pfizer. In a statement to the Times, the US Chamber of Commerce says its lobbying is about preventing countries from discriminating ""against particular companies or industries.""

For the most part, this was a pleasant visit; I idolized my second cousin, an extremely sophisticated ad exec with effortless fashion sense who would later give me my first New Yorker subscription. At that time I was at peak adolescent awkwardness, a too-tall babyfaced half Asian tomboy still too uncomfortable with my physicality to deviate much from a uniform of oversized tees and baggy boys shorts. In other words, I was self-conscious in a way most anyone is at that age. But Chicago was fun; my dad, who also lived in the city, bought me my first pair of Doc Martens, I'd lounge around my cousin's unimaginably luxurious suburban home reading and scratching at the mosquito bites that kept cropping up on my sun-brown hairy legs. My cousin had two Australian shepherds, beautiful, energetic dogs that became my buddies during my stay (I loved dogs in a way that only girls who haven't yet fully discovered boys can.) One of them, Sam, had bright, white eyes, making him always look inordinately thrilled to see me. One day I was waiting for my dad to pick me up for another afternoon in the city. He must have been running a little late, because I found myself in the foyer killing time however an 11 year old killed time in the smartphone-free nineties. I was wearing my new Docs and one of my favorite tee-shirts, which featured the classic Apple ""Dogcow"" icon and his trademark slogan, ""Moof!"" I was feeling pretty jaunty and cool. At one point, Sam found his way into the foyer, poking his black and white head around aimlessly, apparently just stopping by to see what was up. (In retrospect, come to think of it, he looked a lot like the Dogcow.) I went over to him automatically to pet him, but unlike all the times before, he flinched and backed up with a low growl. Confused, but not deterred, I leaned forward again to try to scratch his ears. And that's when he leapt forward and lunged for my eye. Don't worry, he didn't get it — which I am grateful for every single day. I enjoy seeing, especially with depth perception. But he did take out a large chunk of my eyebrow and forehead, and the next 12 hours were a blur. As my cousin sped my mom and I to the emergency room, I looked down and realized my blood-spattered Moof shirt had been ripped in places, so apparently he kept going after the initial jump. I had my first reconstructive surgery later that day. Even if people didn't think they notice something, they do That was followed a year later with a second surgery, but in the meantime my mom and I moved from Washington State to Iowa, where I began eighth grade the worst way to begin eighth grade: at a brand new school in a new place with a jarringly asymmetrical face. Following that, in an effort to relax the parts of my eyebrow that still wanted to creep up my forehead, I got a round of a new cosmetic beauty treatment called Botox, at the wizened old age of thirteen. Eventually it seemed wise to give up. The second surgery had been pretty successful, my eyebrow was still at a definite arch but it was not something most people noticed in casual encounters. (The Botox had been ineffective at doing anything other than causing the right side of my deadened face to sag ever-so-slightly for a week.) I continued my teenage years and the rest of my life with this face; I had my first kiss with this face, graduated high school, moved to Los Angeles, went through several jobs and boyfriends. I was still, of course, hyperaware of my eyebrow (especially in photos, in which I see a reversed image of myself that I'm not used to seeing in the mirror,) but several times, after months of dating someone, I'd tell him this whole story and get a reply of ""Wait ... there's something wrong with your face?"" But even if people didn't think they noticed something, they did. I started to realize this after getting my first driver's permit: when I went into the booth to get my photo taken, I gave what I recall being a perfectly good-natured, bland smile (chin down, of course; I'd been reading Vogue.) But when I showed it off to friends, the reaction wasn't congratulations, or even the good-natured ribbing most of my classmates got for their horrible photos. ""So much attitude!"" they said. ""You look pissed!"" I looked at it again; I suppose there was something snarky lurking behind my dark-rimmed glasses, but I certainly didn't remember trying to affect that — whatever that was. And variations of that would continue for years; usually in the context of looking at photos; invariably if anyone got a look at my driver's license. In my most recent ID, I purposefully parted my hair so that it fell down over my right eyebrow, I still invariably am met with a ""whoa there, sassypants!"" In my previous job at Grantland, my byline photo at the bottom of every article I wrote was often met with comments about what a smug know-it-all I looked like, even on posts that were effusive and harmless. (Until we turned the comments off!) Like so many people, the internet has stunted me into a socially inept robot person who doesn't know how to make friends in the real world, but it doesn't help that when I meet a new acquaintance, my natural RBF (resting bitch face, as seen in fancy newspaper The New York Times,) is coupled with an unnatural RRE (resting raised eyebrow.) I've sometimes come away from social interactions and wondered why things I said with sincerity were met with a hard, knowing laugh, why people often defaulted to irony and snark with me after I just saw them have a far less guarded conversation with someone else across the bar. Most of the time I don't even get the ""smile, honey"" so many RBF sufferers are met with on a daily basis, I'm guessing because most construction workers (or colleagues, or publicists, or bartenders) get one look at me and figure I already hate them. I realize I have very little to complain about I sometimes wonder about the degree to which I've internalized these subtle reactions, in the same way garden-variety RBFers do as well. To walk through the world not automatically fulfilling an unspoken quota of female cheer is one thing; I actually find parts of that to be liberating. (Don't talk to me about this ""Resting Dick Face,"" GQ, everyone knows grumpy men are automatically more interesting and valued in society than grumpy women and cheerful men. Kidding! That was the eyebrow talking.) But to walk through the world being perceived as actively disdainful is to experience much of it at a disingenuous arm's length, like being stuck in permanent IRL Oscars Twitter. My injury didn't leave me disfigured, there is no systematic discrimination against people with RBF or RRE, and it hasn't stopped me from getting jobs (except in the service industry, which I found it confoundingly difficult to break into in college.) I realize I have very little to complain about. But no matter how much we move our lives and social interactions online, faces are still very important realities — we'll never know how many terabytes of subtle information we're broadcasting from the god- or dog-given way our eyebrows sit on our face or our mouths curve upward or downward.

Like Tesla, Mercedes' battery packs are filled with cells originally designed with cars in mind, and they're designed to even the load so solar energy can be stored overnight and homes can draw from the grid during off-peak hours. The company says that you can combine up to eight packs — 2.5 kWh each, for a total of 20 kWh — which will make it appropriate both for home and business use.

Similarly, Tesla's Powerwalls can be combined into ""Powerpacks"" that scale all the way up to 10 MWh or more.

The NTSB has called on automakers to implement avoidance technology before, but they haven't heeded the call — the board says that only four models of passenger vehicles included a complete forward collision avoidance system as a standard feature last year. ""You don’t pay extra for your seatbelt,"" Christopher Hart, NTSB chairman, says in a statement. ""And you shouldn’t have to pay extra for technology that can help prevent a collision altogether.""  Regulators will need to encourage automakers to start doing this As part of a report issued this week, the NTSB is recommending that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration begin developing standards for systems that can avoid rear-end collisions. The board wants automakers to begin including collision warning systems immediately and to add in assisted braking and autonomous braking once standards are finalized. The NTSB's general vision of this system is that it might warn a driver as they're approaching a potential collision and need to brake, begin braking for the driver if there's no response, and finally stop the car if necessary. The board believes that these systems can provide even more safety as they become integrated with connected cars in the future.  While the NTSB's recommendations sound like excellent suggestions, there's no immediate reason to believe that they'll lead to changes. As the board notes in apparent aggravation, it's made 12 recommendations in favor of implementing similar technology over the past 20 years, and not much has happened. This week, it's suggesting that regulators create incentives for automakers to implement these systems, such as by factoring collision avoidance systems into car safety ratings. These systems seem increasingly doable as automakers continue their research into autonomous driving tech, so we can hope these recommendations don't have to go on for another 20 years.",0.20508093292546148,0.7949190670745385,0.855518712616366,345,5.4173913043478263,206,6.0873786407766994,0,0,"Transportation, US & World"

Now, it sounds like swaps are basically dead on arrival. In response to a question from an investor at Tesla's shareholders' meeting today, Musk was brutally honest about the situation: We have the LA-to-San Francisco pack swap capability in place, and I believe all Model S owners in the California area have been invited at this point to try it out. And what we're seeing is a very low take rate for the pack swap station. So we did an initial round of invitations, where we did basically like 200 invitations, and I think there were a total of four or five people that wanted to do that, and they all did it just once. So, okay, it's clearly not very popular. And then we said, okay, let's expand that invitation to all customers, but I would expect that all customers roughly behave like that initial sample group. It's just, people don't care about pack swap. The Superchargers are fast enough that if you're driving from LA to San Francisco, and you start a trip at 9AM, by the time you get to, say, noon, you want to stop, and you want to stretch your legs, hit the restroom, grab a bite to eat, grab a coffee, and be on your way, and by that time, the car is charged and ready to go, and it's free. So, it's like, why would you do the pack swap? It doesn't make much sense. We built the pack swap into the car because we weren't sure if people would want to choose the pack swap or not. We thought people would prefer Supercharging, but we weren't sure, so that's why we built the pack swap capability in. And based on what we're seeing here, it's unlikely to be something that's worth expanding in the future, unless something changes. For the Superchargers, as we said in the initial press release, the Superchargers are free. It's basically free long distance for life, forever. So free long distance forever is what the Superchargers are providing. Now, there are a few people who are quite aggressively using it for local Supercharging, and we will sort of send them just a reminder note that it's cool to do this occasionally, but it's meant to be a long-distance thing. But it is free long distance forever, and it's basically built into the cost of the car. And based on what we're seeing in terms of the economics, it looks quite supportable. Of course, the poor uptake Musk saw in the ""sample group"" is artificially low. The current station does swaps by appointment only; no one refills their car's gas tank by appointment, so it's no wonder no one's getting a battery swap on a regular basis. In reality, Superchargers and battery swaps would both have their place if the swap infrastructure was built out enough — there's something to be said for pulling into a service station on a neighborhood corner and getting a full charge within a few seconds — but the company only has a single trial station running, and it'd be billions of dollars and years away from building that network out. For a company with many priorities, huge ambitions, and limited resources, the swaps are low-hanging fruit to cut. Musk also mentioned that the first Model X deliveries are just a few months out; given his ambivalence, it wouldn't be surprising if they lost swap support altogether.",0.43404889695218885,0.5659511030478112,0.16532241727497063,636,4.6242138364779874,333,5.5945945945945947,0,0,Transportation

Over time, the theory goes, some of those technologies filter down to the more plebeian models in the range. But perhaps nowhere is that effect more important than with Mercedes-Benz's S-Class and BMW's 7 Series, where each new generation brings an entire catalog of sci-fi-esque gadgets and creature comforts. The new 7, announced today, is certainly no exception. Let's start with the basics: in the US, the 7 will be available in two configurations at launch. The base model is the 740i with a 3-liter, 320-horsepower TwinPower inline six starting at $81,300; above that is the 750i xDrive with a redesigned 4.4-liter, 445-horsepower twin turbo V-8 starting at $97,400. The 740e xDrive plug-in hybrid joins the range in 2016, with pricing to be announced. Both the 740i and 750i xDrive will be sold only in long-wheelbase configurations in the US. That means that, at least for the moment, we'll be losing quite a few US configurations: the current 7 is available in a short-wheelbase version, a diesel, a hybrid, and a V-12.     But this car isn't really about engines, it's about... well, basically everything else. It starts with the key — the optional Display Key, to be specific, which looks like a larger version of BMW's standard wireless fob with a full color touchscreen embedded in it. From there, you can control car functions from afar — pre-heating on a cold day, for instance. The fob can charge while it's inside the car, but if it dies, don't worry: there's a second battery that'll make sure it just acts like a regular wireless key until you have a chance to recharge. (The Display Key debuted on the i8 as an option, but it's not available on any of BMW's other vehicles yet.) So, yes, to recap: your key, should you tick the Display Key option when you order your 7, is effectively a smartphone minus the phone. But there's more, of course. Inside the cabin, you may notice a pleasant odor. That would be the 7 Series' optional Ambient Air package, featuring a programmable fragrance system that offers eight choices in three different intensities. (Mercedes actually beat BMW to configurable cabin fragrances with the latest S Class.) The 7 Series, more than any other BMW, is as much about the passenger experience as it is the driver's — especially important in China, a key market where many well-off car owners are chauffeured. Those passengers probably aren't going to be disappointed here, particularly if they spec the Luxury Rear Seating Package and Rear Executive Lounge Seating Package. The executive package, in particular, is insane. It lets rear seats be reclined up to 42.5 degrees, while the front passenger seat can be moved all the way forward, the headrest can be electrically moved out of the way, and a footrest pops out of the back. The 7-inch Touch Command Tablet, a Samsung running Android that we first saw at CES earlier this year, sits in the rear center console and can be used to control a variety of car functions — including the ""Vitality Program,"" which BMW says will ""revitalize the body on longer journeys"" through active seat movements. And when those passengers look up at night, they'll probably get a kick out of the optional ""Panoramic Sky Lounge LED Roof,"" which projects light across etchings on the sunroof's glass to show a ""starlit sky"" in your choice of six colors. (BMW division Rolls-Royce offers a similar option, but it's done through fiber optics wired directly into the headliner and costs a hilariously large amount of money.) For drivers, meanwhile, there's a bunch of technology: a much larger heads-up display, for instance, that can show considerably more information. (It's basically an augmented reality windshield at this point.) Cameras outside the vehicle automatically scan road signs and upload the information to BMW's servers, which feed back into updated navigation data that's beamed back to all cars. The new 7 isn't fully self-driving — that's still going to be a while yet — but it does about as much as it possibly can within the bounds of the law. There's dynamic cruise with full stop and start, of course, with a traffic jam assist function that will pilot the car in heavy traffic as long as one hand remains on the wheel. It'll also park itself, although at least in US models it appears that a driver needs to be in the car — probably more for legal reasons than technological constraints. ""But wait, that's not all,"" as they say. (News of this car was delivered on a 24-page press release, and it's difficult to decide which wild features warrant discussing here.) This car also debuts iDrive 5.0 — BMW's oft-maligned connected car system that has improved by leaps and bounds in recent years. Here, iDrive gets touchscreen support for the first time (but still maintains the traditional iDrive controller in the center console) and introduces gesture control. Sensors in the headliner track the driver's hands; there are only a small number of gestures supported, presumably to limit distraction and prevent the system from getting confused; you can raise or lower volume with a circular finger motion, wave your hand left or right to accept and reject calls, and configure one additional gesture to control one of several different functions. We recently had a chance to see the car up close; even though it's a 7 Series, it's much less imposing than you might expect. It'd be easy to confuse it for a current-generation 5 Series, even though the long-wheelbase version that's available in North America is considerably larger. Short wheel overhangs and swooping contours do a lot to minimize the new 7's presence, and BMW says that it should handle more like a 5 Series when you're behind the wheel than the outgoing 7. It's an attractive car, without a doubt, and might be the best-looking 7 since the third-generation E38 of 1994–2001. In person, you really get the sense that BMW designed this car around the passenger, not the driver. There are two 10-inch displays mounted behind each front seat, to which you can send video content from a phone or tablet via Chromecast (including Netflix). Oddly enough, these are not touchscreens, even though the natural inclination when you sit in the car is to use them as such — for touch, you'll have to turn your attention to the 7-inch tablet in the center console. For an environment that's supposed to be relaxing, the displays, colorful lights, and interactivity can be a little overwhelming. In the front, BMW's various methods of interaction with iDrive (as mentioned earlier, there are no less than three different ways to control the infotainment system) are a bit overwhelming. The gestures to control the system did work as advertised, but they don't feel natural and it's generally just easier to do the same thing with the steering wheel-mounted buttons. Also confusing is BMW's complete lack of support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, which will undoubtedly be a growing customer demand over the coming years. (BMW tells us that it is still evaluating those systems, but there's no news as to when it might support them.) The 740i and 750i xDrive arrive in dealerships this fall; just remember to bring a driver when you buy it so you can sit in the back.",0.6017329501917725,0.39826704980822747,0.5227293921594088,1273,4.8868813825608797,661,6.2753403933434191,0,54,"Transportation, Hands-on, Photo Essay"

UX and UI designer Alcion has opened up Photoshop and some 3D rendering software to find out.

Perhaps not surprisingly, there are a number of UI elements that match a round display perfectly, including the home interface and activity monitor.

The Watch features a new typeface that Apple designed in-house ""to maximize legibility,"" it says — a noble and important goal when you're dealing with a particularly small display. Interestingly, Google's Roboto was designed with some of the same goals in mind when it rolled out with Android 4.0 almost three years ago. I almost immediately noticed similarities to Roboto when Apple showed the Watch on stage today, which makes sense: a simple, light, sans serif font lends itself to maximum legibility.

It's too big. It's too shiny. Its face is too large in comparison to its bezel. Its strap flops out from the edge of its case like a dog's tongue on a hot day. That's my opinion. Many will disagree with me, but I don't care. I will never wear a Moto 360. I might wear an Apple Watch, though. I expect millions of others might too. Let's get one thing out of the way: the Apple Watch is not a pretty watch. A bulbous slab of metal, its case is a chunky blob with a square face and bulging sides. But while not conventionally attractive, it does achieve one extremely important goal: anonymity. However big it may be, the soft lines of the case seem to almost fade into insignificance, shifting focus to the strap and display. There will be 34 Apple Watch models across three ""collections,"" and thanks to an ingenious design flourish in the form of a proprietary strap system, each looks distinct.    Far more than replaceable straps While a number of smartwatches offer either replaceable straps or a choice of colors at retail, this customization fails to truly change their general aesthetic. Whether fitted with leather strapping or metal links, a Moto 360 is a Moto 360. Changing the strap on a Pebble Steel is simply changing the strap, and nothing else. The Apple Watch's customization is deeper. The proprietary system lets straps come with their own lugs (the small pieces of metal that connect a watch's case to its strap), and these lugs are individually tailored to match both the strap and the finish of the watch. It's hard to overemphasize how much this can change the look of a watch.      The standard ""Apple Watch collection"" models will be available with a choice of two finishes, stainless steel or ""Space Black"" stainless steel, and with six different types of strap. These straps connect to the same hollow in the sides of the watch, but the journey they take from there differs dramatically. The buckle designs encompass unfussy symmetrical metal lugs and simple leather straps; the link bracelet and sport band options do away with lugs and curve directly into the case; while the Milanese loop offers a modern lopsided fitting. This single collection features 18 models that offer a staggering variety of style. The ""Sport collection,"" which replaces the case's stainless steel for aluminum and only comes with synthetic rubber straps, turn the same simple design into a G-Shock-esque sports watch. Add in the oddly named ""Edition collection,"" set in gold and with design flourishes added to the crown, and it's clear what Apple is trying to do here. It’s trying to make a watch for everyone.   One watch, many designs, many wearers Apple can't just make a Moto 360. It can't invest millions and millions of dollars in a new operating system, in new materials, and in marketing, for a single piece of jewelry with a divisive design. The watch industry, and the jewelry industry in general, thrives on our desire to be individual. Hundreds of thousands of watch designs are out there, of which only a handful will appeal to you. Until very recently, I knew no two people that wore the same watch, and it's perhaps my line of work that led me to meet two Pebble owners. If the Watch is to become what Apple needs it to be — a massive new product line like the iPhone or iPad — it has to be wearable by millions, not thousands. An anonymous, customizable design gives what is a very appealing gadget a chance to find a home on almost anyone's wrist. One watch, many designs, many wearers. It works for MetaWatch, and Apple is betting it will work on a far grander scale here. There is only one Apple Watch I would consider wearing, but that's enough The Apple Watch is clearly not perfect. Square designs undoubtedly comprise a small proportion of the over-one-billion watches bought every year. We're all familiar with circular watches, and the initial reaction to the Moto 360 sends a clear signal that we're not ready to let go of that design. Assuming its software works and its battery life is solid, you'd expect this first generation of the Apple Watch to sell well. For its second generation, Apple will need to continue down the same path, iterating on its design with sleeker models, with circular cases, and with a broader variety of case and strap materials. But as an entry into an entirely new market for the company, the Apple Watch casts a wide net. Of the 34 designs on offer, there is only one that I would consider wearing. But if millions can say the same, then the Apple Watch has a chance to succeed.",0.5478166191963747,0.4521833808036253,0.17096170650564266,823,4.6051032806804377,418,5.8181818181818183,2,4,"Apple, Design, Tech, Editorial"

As noted by FastCo Design, the official 1970 MTA Graphics Standards manual is now being reprinted as a full-sized hardback book. The original 1970 guide was created by Vignelli and Bob Noorda and was a huge help in cleaning up the confusing subway system — there were no design guidelines, so it wasn't uncommon for different stations to have totally different signs, with some even being handwritten. The design guide helped standardize the MTA's style and make it much simpler for commuters and tourists to get around. As such, the guide became one of the more revered books for graphic designers. A few years ago, a copy of the guide was found in the basement of design firm Pentagram — and thanks to a licensing agreement with the MTA, the guide being offered on Kickstarter is a complete and faithful reproduction. According to the campaign, the book will never be issued again after the Kickstarter closes on October 10th, though it's not clear if there's any limit on how many books will be printed.

Today, just shy of the 13th anniversary of its initial release, the classic iPod is finally being discontinued. Here’s a look back across the revolutionary line of MP3 players, from its simple beginnings, to its flashy days of glory, right down to its final redesign. Lead image by Michael Shane.3rd generation iPod classic from Matthew Pearce (Flickr). First generation, 2001. The original iPod famously put “1,000 songs in your pocket.” It had a scroll wheel that physically rotated, a giant FireWire port on top for charging and syncing, and was available in 5 and 10GB models for $399 and $499 respectively. Second generation, 2002. The iPod’s second version was almost identical to its first, but it replaced the original device’s mechanical wheel with a touch-sensitive one. Storage space was also doubled at both price points, and for the first time it supported use on Windows. Third generation, 2003. For its first redesign, the iPod slimmed down drastically, dropping FireWire in favor of the 30-pin connector that Apple used for nearly a decade afterward, and turning the playback controls into capacitive touch buttons. Base storage stayed at 10GB, but 30 and 40GB models were also offered. (Image credit: Matthew Pearce / Flickr) Fourth generation, 2004. The iPod’s next redesign introduced the Click Wheel, with playback controls built right into the scroll ring. It came in 20 and 40GB models, and an updated model featuring a color display was introduced just months later. The iPod didn’t just sell itself. Apple ran an aggressive — and soon iconic — advertising campaign for several years that featured silhouetted figures dancing to music played off bright white iPods. They were hard to miss, and hard not to like. Fifth generation, 2005. The penultimate iPod redesign was the first classic to be available in both black and white. It had a flat front, a color display, and was offered in 30, 60, and 80GB models. Also known as the iPod video, it was the first iPod to support movie playback. While the initial iPod ads featured solid, brightly colored backgrounds, the later ones got a little more complicated with scattered backgrounds, eclectic colors schemes, and more detailed models. Even so, they were as fun and energetic as ever. Sixth generation, 2007. The iPod’s final redesign, and how it stayed for over six years.

Facebook has hinted for some time that it wants its legions of users to be able read news articles without leaving the social network, and this is the product of those plans. Get the news without leaving Facebook A great deal about the program was revealed by the Times back in March, but the Journal has some new details on how Facebook is trying to woo publications to Instant Articles. Under one scheme that's being considered, publications will keep all ad revenue from articles posted on Facebook if the sites themselves sell the ads. If Facebook does the legwork of selling the ads, it will keep 30 percent of the revenue for itself. Those numbers suggest that Facebook doesn't see Instant Articles as a direct revenue stream, but rather as a way to keep its users on its site — a benefit that can indirectly increase Facebook's earnings. Facebook already has a commanding presence in the news business. The largest publications see a massive percentage of their traffic (and, therefore, ad revenue) come from Facebook referrals. Many sites are wary of giving more control to Facebook, but some see it as a necessary means of survival. Facebook, meanwhile, is reportedly arguing in its pitches that Instant Articles will lead to increased readership, since the articles will pop up quickly straight in the app instead of taking upwards of eight seconds to load in a web browser.",0.3419111206174296,0.6580888793825703,0.8297625219318355,276,4.9311594202898554,174,5.5574712643678161,0,0,"Business, Tech"

Announcing the new promotion, which starts on May 13th, Legere was in similar form, focusing his trademark ire on Verizon specifically.

Reached for comment, Tidal said this statement was false, and that it actually pays closer to four times the royalty rate of its largest competitor, paying $0.024 to $0.028 per stream compared with the $0.006 to $0.0084 Spotify doles out. Is the free ride about to end?  All that sounds like salvation for the music industry, and it's part of a larger trend. As we reported yesterday, the labels have been in talks with Apple about trying to kill Spotify’s free tier. That would significantly increase the average royalty payment from the world’s largest streaming service, although Apple's tactics have drawn scrutiny from the DOJ as potentially anti-competitive behavior. But is cutting out a free tier really the best way to bring in more money? ""My view has been, and the data shows, you will sell more music with a lower price, because it's an elastic market,"" says David Pakman, a tech investor and former digital music entrepreneur. He crunched the numbers across more than a decade of music sales — from the pre-Napster peak of 1999 to the streaming era of 2012 — and found that the average consumer is willing to spend between $45-65 a year on music. When you average out what Spotify’s 60 million users pay, it comes out to just $30 a year. The labels' insistence on $120 as the base rate for paid streaming services prices most consumers out. ""If you really want to generate more revenue, find a price between $0 and $120,"" says Pakman. This was reportedly the route Apple wanted to go, aiming for a price point between $5 and $8 a month. But the labels nixed this plan. So Apple fell back on the playbook it used when trying to elbow its way into the ebook market against Amazon. Apple has taken this approach before against Amazon Apple is ""in a market share battle, not looking for profit,"" says Pakman. Just as Apple appealed to publishers by offering to help undercut Amazon's market power, it is now coaxing labels to nix the free tier for Spotify and YouTube, offering to eat the cost and deliver higher paying customers instead. ""It might be good for Apple, and it might be good for the label, but is it good for consumers? I don’t think so,"" says Pakman. ""And I don’t think it's the best business model in the long run."" In a world where streaming music is available for $10 a month or not at all, Pakman predicts a renewed surge of piracy from the hundreds of millions who currently rely on Spotify and YouTube to get their music for free, supported by advertising. Is Tidal's end goal something entirely different?  Of course, Tidal’s end goal here may be very different from Apple. It’s owned by artists, and its new Discovery feature is trying to cut out the major labels entirely, helping to market and promote unsigned acts directly to fans. By paying a far more generous rate, Tidal may be heading in the opposite direction from Apple, ignoring market share and attempting to force streaming services and the labels to cut artists a bigger slice of the pie instead.",0.6041124023652106,0.3958875976347894,0.48874961472548567,566,4.7120141342756181,328,5.5365853658536581,0,0,"Business, Culture, Tech, Report"

A programmer named Lauren Voswinkel first proposed the idea of publicly tweeting your job title, experience level, and salary under the hashtag #talkpay earlier this week. And the topic just started trending in San Francisco. Public debate about pay inequality has only recently begun to progress beyond telling women to ""lean in."" That phrase, popularized by Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, suggests that if women assert themselves without seeming threatening, they can make as much as their male counterparts. But a couple weeks ago, The New Republic wrote about how the pay gap widens for women of color, pointing to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that showed Hispanic women earn 54 percent of what a white man makes, followed by black women at 64 percent. On Equal Pay Day last month, CNN explored how the pay gap impacts life outside the office, leaving women almost twice as likely to retire into poverty. Around the same time, Ellen Pao, the interim CEO of Reddit, told The Wall Street Journal that she banned salary negotiations at Reddit because ""men negotiate harder than women do and sometimes women get penalized when they do negotiate."" Pao lost a $16 million lawsuit for gender discrimination against Kleiner Perkins, alleging that the prestigious Silicon Valley venture capital firm failed to promote women to senior partner, a title that came with up to five times the amount of income. Voswinkel proposed #talkpay in Model View Culture, a magazine that highlights feminist and minority voices from the tech industry. She argues that the absence of information, as well as the tendency to hire from one's own network and apply pattern-matching to the hiring process all disproportionately benefit white males: Exacerbating that problem, conceptions of what a ""real"" developer looks like impact people’s interactions with potential candidates, particularly more junior ones, causing them to be evaluated at lower skill levels which leads to lower rate of offers and lower initial salary offers. The lack of knowledge regarding reasonable salaries and predatory behaviors in tech companies can be directly attributed to the social taboo surrounding people talking openly about their salaries. Perhaps because of the origins of #talkpay, the bulk of participants on Twitter thus far seem to be from the tech sector. Silicon Valley corporations like Apple and Google paid a $415 million settlement in January for a class action lawsuit alleging that they colluded to suppress salaries and not poach each other's employees. But rising income inequality and the wage gap are systemic issues faced across industries, especially compared to rising average salaries for the right kind of knowledge worker in the Bay Area. Ultimately, change may start outside the so-called cradle of innovation. The city of Boston, for example, just began collecting wage data from participating companies, tying in the worker's experience level to get a more holistic picture on salary discrepancies. Mayor Martin J. Walsh told company representatives, who were ""almost all women"" that it was ""a culture that we have to change."" #talkpay Other takeaway: being on an H1-B is a massive power imbalance between you and your employer that will keep your salary low.

Now Noto is Twitter's chief financial officer, and he's changing the score again, moving the social network's hapless marketing department under his control. Marketing is not typically the purview of a CFO, and a source familiar with the situation told The Verge that the unusual structure was discussed in a meeting at Twitter headquarters Monday. ""Noto is consolidating power, so to speak,"" the source said. During the dot-com bubble, Noto hyped troubled tech stocks like eToys and Webvan. These days, he's better known as the Twitter exec whose direct message fail exposed a planned acquisition, and who later had his Twitter account hacked. Regardless, Noto is rewarded handsomely for his services. In 2014, he received a $72.8 million compensation package, mostly in stock, taking home roughly three times more than his predecessor. Charged with boosting user growth Last week, Noto co-starred with CEO Dick Costolo on the earnings call delivering bad news to shareholders. Twitter has been fending off Wall Street's unhappiness with slower growth to its user base. The latest quarterly report showed that Twitter's revenue growth also slowed, failing to meet expectations. The bad quarter, which caused a steep drop in the company's stock price, reignited speculation that Costolo's job could be in jeopardy.   Noto heads up several areas beyond finance, including corporate development, corporate strategy, and real estate. He took over marketing after months of fruitless searching for a chief marketing officer. Since January, marketing has fallen under the auspices of Kevin Weil, senior vice president of product. Before that, marketing was led by chief communications officer Gabriel Sticker. Taking over at a key time Noto takes over marketing at a key time: Twitter desperately needs to be able to explain itself to the masses. Given the company's challenges with user growth, it does not bode well for the company that it keeps tossing the mic. When longtime employee Gabriel Stricker expanded his role to VP of marketing and communications in 2013, All Things D wrote: Stricker's bio on Twitter's executive team page says he's now the chief communications officer. There's no mention of marketing on the entire page, except to note that Stricker is the author of the bestselling book on guerrilla marketing Mao In the Boardroom. The search for a CMO has dragged on for months and is still ongoing. According to one source, Kate Jhaveri, senior director of consumer marketing at Twitter, was passed over for the chief marketing role despite the fuss Twitter made over poaching her from Facebook, where she led consumer branding and mobile marketing for three years. The source told The Verge Jhaveri plans to resign, but she is still with the company. (She did not respond to requests for comment.) A senior director was passed over for the job The exodus of executives from Twitter has been an ongoing saga. The most tumultuous recent departure was chief operating officer Ali Rowghani, who resigned last June after ""a dispute"" with CEO Dick Costolo. If Jhaveri leaves, though, that will be at least the fourth high-level female leader to leave Twitter in the past 10 months. That group includes Vivian Schiller, Twitter's head of news, who split with the company in October after just 10 months. Schiller, the former CEO of NPR, who held top roles at NBC News and The New York Times Digital, was a high-profile hire. In February, April Underwood, director of product, departed the company. Chloe Sladden, Twitter's vice president of media, left last August. The women may be done with Twitter, but they still enjoy working together. In March, four current and two former female Twitter employees launched an investment group for investing in early-stage startups called #Angels. The same month, a former female software engineer named Tina Huang filed a class-action lawsuit against Twitter for gender discrimination, alleging that the company's process for promoting employees favors men and the hiring process is controlled by largely male upper management. Noto's first task may be figuring out how to market himself a little better at the office. The same source told The Verge, ""Twitter employees [are] asking why Noto gets $70 million, but the company can’t afford to give raises, or bring salaries closer to market rates."" Although engineers make around market rate, the source said, non-technical employees do not.

In a statement, Facebook said the change is ""to give us more control and flexibility in delivering a consistent maps experience.""

One of the leading mobile apps in the world of digital health is MyFitnessPal, which was acquired by Under Armour earlier this year for $475 million. Today the company, which tracks diet and exercise, is launching its first premium service, an ad-free paid subscription for power users. ""People want to go beyond the calorie."" ""People want to go beyond the calorie,"" said founder Mike Lee. The service, which now counts over 70 million active users, began as a way to simply track what you ate. It then layered on activity tracking and would update meal suggestions based on exercise. But a lot of power users wanted to go deeper, and were willing to pay for it. ""We want to offer them a way to make custom reports, to dig deeper into the nutrient density of the food, and to customize the measurements used to plan their meals."" The premium service will cost $9.99 a month or $49.99 a year and will be available on iOS and Android.   The transition from helping average people lose weight to helping bodybuilders perfect their protein intake makes a lot of sense now that MFP is part of Under Armour. The app has become popular among the musclebound set, but its features were still mainly aimed at ordinary folks trying to lose weight. The new features recognize that, and pivot toward the brand of its new parent company. ""At a very high level, Under Armour’s mission is to make athletes better,"" says Lee. ""It was clear to them that digital and data was becoming a bigger part of how to improve athletic performance."" Is Under Armour a technology company?  But is Under Armour, best known as an apparel company, really in a position to challenge companies like Apple and Google, both of which are working on plans to help people track and understand their health data? ""Data is fine, but to keep people coming back to the app, you need community,"" says Lee. ""That’s what we have that they don’t."" With the acquisition of MyFitnessPal and Endomondo this February, Under Armour says it has 120 million active users sharing data about their diet and exercise. It’s not clear if people can communicate across those different services yet, but the ability to chat with other users is a key to maximizing engagement.   There is another, less convincing argument about brand synergy here. ""A lot of people don’t understand this about them, but they are a technology company, from the very beginning. It was a shirt developed by a football player who was frustrated with his cotton t-shirt weighing him down and making him cold. So he developed the compression shirt."" Lee says. ""They created a mag-zip zipper, changing something that was the same for 50 years. You can do it one handed!"" Zippers aside, Under Armour has experimented with building its own wearables. Earlier this year it announced a partnership with HTC around the Grip fitness band and it also created its own wearable fitness band, the Armour 39. The device got high marks for its comfort and data, but lacked a polished app and social features. That is precisely the kind of experience it got with the MyFitnessPal purchase.  ""They have tried this stuff before, but realized they needed a little outside expertise, says Lee. ""They don’t want to be disrupted, they want to be the disrupter.""",0.8867208454638871,0.11327915453611292,0.8357003841133263,611,4.7774140752864156,349,5.759312320916905,0,4,"Apps, Business, Tech, Report"

The billionaire's electric car company, Tesla Motors, quietly launched a pre-owned vehicle program at the end of April — a new scheme that offers older versions of its Model S sedan for lower prices than new models. The used cars still come with Tesla maintenance and reliability checks, and like other high-end car makers, Musk's company gives a 4-year or 50,000-mile warranty on pre-owned vehicles. A Tesla spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal that the used cars would be stored at a Tesla location, allowing customers to collect their car directly, or have it delivered to their home. For now, limited supplies of the used Model S electric cars mean that the new scheme is currently only available in 11 US cities, with supplies coming from display models or owners who traded their older sedans in for new all-wheel-drive models under Tesla's trade-in schemes. But the company can expect an influx of older vehicles soon, as owners who bought their first-generation Model S on a three-year lease in 2013 return the car to the manufacturer. The used cars come with a 4-year or 50,000-mile warranty Used cars on sale via the program are available for between $60,000 to $90,000 — generally cheaper than the same vehicles can be found from individual resellers. The cheaper used cars, which are currently available for purchase via Tesla's official site, make the barrier for electric vehicle ownership lower, a move aimed to help the manufacturer snare new customers at the same time as it disposes of older vehicles that would otherwise clutter up its parking lots and facilities.

It's been a valuable tradeoff for some, building billion-dollar companies and unlocking huge libraries of music and video for relatively paltry subscription fees, but it's also been a challenge for cities that rely on those businesses for revenue. Now, Chicago wants to take back those missing taxes, and the way it's retaking them has some lawyers up in arms. Today, a new ""cloud tax"" takes effect in the city of Chicago, targeting online databases and streaming entertainment services. It's a puzzling tax, cutting against many of the basic assumptions of the web, but the broader implications could be even more unsettling. Cloud services are built to be universal: Netflix works the same anywhere in the US, and except for rights constraints, you could extend that to the entire world. But many taxes are local — and as streaming services swallow up more and more of the world's entertainment, that could be a serious problem. The ruling targets ""electronically delivered amusements."" Chicago's new tax is actually composed of two recent rulings made by the city's Department of Finance: one covering ""electronically delivered amusements"" and another covering ""nonpossessory computer leases."" Each one takes an existing tax law and extends it to levy an extra 9 percent tax on certain types of online services. The first ruling presumably covers streaming media services like Netflix and Spotify, while the second would cover remote database or computing platforms like Amazon Web Services or Lexis Nexis. Under the new law, what passes as $100 of server time in Springfield would cost $109 if you're conducting it from an office in Chicago. Although the tax is technically levied on consumers, some companies are already preparing to collect it as part of the monthly bill. Netflix says it’s already making arrangements to add the tax to the cost charged to its Chicago customers. ""Jurisdictions around the world, including the US, are trying to figure out ways to tax online services,"" said a Netflix representative, reached by The Verge. ""This is one approach."" The result for services is both higher prices and a new focus on localization. For the web services portion, the most likely effect is simply moving servers outside of the city limits — and, where possible, the offices that use them. Once implemented, streaming services will also have to keep closer track of which subscribers fall under the new tax, whether through billing addresses or more restrictive methods like IP tracking, which is already used to enforce rights restrictions. 20 years ago, the same albums and movies were bought from brick-and-mortar stores Some lawyers have already taken issue with the city's move. After the rulings were announced, Reed Smith partner Michael Wynne argued the taxes violate both the Federal Telecommunications Act and, in the case of the second ruling, 1998's Internet Tax Freedom Act, intended to prevent discrimination against services delivered over the internet. ""I could do that same activity of research using books or periodicals without being taxed,"" Wynne says. ""So it does seem like I'm being picked on because I chose to do it online."" But while the law may seem onerous, it's also a response to an increasingly difficult reality for cash-strapped cities, particularly as online services start to take a bite out of the businesses in the urban center. Twenty years ago, the same albums and movies were consumed at video rental outlets and music stores — which paid local property taxes, potentially paired with municipal sales taxes and other brick-and-mortar duties. But as online subscription services take over more and more of our music and video budgets, that money ends up disappearing from the traditional municipal tax base. By 2015, the people of Chicago are being entertained by corporations outside of the reach of the city government, leaving it scrambling to make up the difference. Facing a severe budget shortfall, it's easy to see how a city might look toward online services to fill the gap. Still, the net result for cloud services and customers alike is a confusing hodgepodge. If taxes like Chicago's become widespread, it could become a persistent problem for services like the newly launched Apple Music, which hope to tempt listeners away from ad-supported services like Spotify’s free tier. It would also mean further monitoring on where media is being consumed, which would mean the experience of using a VPN to watch a US-only video might be a harbinger of things to come. In the meantime, the law world is struggling to piece through what the old laws will really mean for the cloud. ""There's no question that the city needs revenue and I can see where things are escaping the old tax base,"" says Wynne, ""I think the objectionable part is that, instead of drafting new laws for that, we're simply stretching the old laws to fit.""",0.5474843799461155,0.45251562005388446,0.6074280952766675,828,5.0966183574879231,444,6.2590090090090094,0,0,"Apps, Entertainment, Policy & Law, US & World, Report"

He served as the play-by-play announcer for the Grand Finals of the recent Dota 2 International Championships in Seattle, and sat down with me this past week for a chat about his career and the game he loves. Vlad Savov: Before we delve into how and when you first got into competitive gaming, can you summarize what it is that you do? Toby Dawson: What I do is something that has evolved over the years. Initially it was running tournaments, then it was working with a group of commentators and managing them, and also being a commentator, and then I turned to working on a project. You only keep building and evolving in this industry, because it’s still developing, so you never really say, ""I just do this one thing."" Or at least I don’t like saying that. We have a couple of guys here who say they’re just here to commentate, but I never really accepted that. I always like to try and do a little bit more. Currently, I would describe what I do as commentary and a lot of stuff behind the scenes for our project, which is joinDOTA. What is the project? joinDOTA is an online website, which basically covers everything in Dota 2. It’s been around since Dota 2 first began — but not since Dota first began, there’s only a couple of websites which date back before then. We were the first ones ever to actually run tournaments as well, so like the first thing we ever did was the BenQ Clash, which was directly after TI1 was done. So we had a $1.6 million prize pool [in TI1] and then we had the BenQ Clash for 500 euros. Because that was all the scene was capable of sustaining. We also ran the first... what was then classed as a major, which was a $10,000 tournament sponsored by a group called own3D TV and the title of the tournament was The Defense. We kind of always were pushing the limit on that one, I was the primary stream for all of that (obviously, because it was our project), but I was also kind of the only primary English caster out there. There was a couple of other groups that started to appear just before TI2, but yeah, we were kind of like the only dog in the water for that kind of stuff. How did you first come into the scene? What got you into gaming in the first place? So you actually want to go back to the start of everything? Yeah, we can go back to your childhood. I don’t think we can go back to my childhood, because even in my childhood, my mom was very much against games. I had a maximum of one hour of games every single day. Really? And she adhered to that? Well, I pushed the boundaries whenever I could. But it was along the lines of games were a reward. They weren’t anything more than that, so do all your chores before you start your games. So yeah, I learned to use Alt-Tab from a very early age. I was also a Nintendo 64 boy, so I spent a lot of time on those games. When gaming really started for me was probably back in 2003. I’d just graduated from high school and I started my studies at university. I was doing courses in education and I was like ""okay, I still wanna have fun when I’m at home"" and I ended up playing with my cousin in a Battlefield 1942 clan. We had some good fun there and I picked up Call of Duty vanilla as well, and I started playing in that, and eventually I ended up leading a couple of the teams. So I took care of the clan stuff, everything like day-to-day as well as even website creation (I still don’t know how I did that to this day). These were Call of Duty teams? Call of Duty and Battlefield, yeah. So I played a lot there. And I always like having more responsibility. I don’t like seeing things being done incorrectly, or not to their fullest potential, so then I started actually adminning tournaments. I took over a place called Garena and started working with a group called CyberGamer down in Australia. They were the two biggest leagues for Call Of Duty and Battlefield. I ended up fully taking over part of the Call of Duty section of it. It was around that time that one of my games was dying. People were moving on from vanilla COD as Call of Duty 2 had come out. But I hated Call of Duty 2, so I tried to keep everyone back in my game, and one way I thought I could do that was by commentating the games. Not myself, getting other people to do it, because I didn’t know how to commentate. I was like ""what the hell is this?"" So there was a group in Australia called Gamestah and I went to them, they had a request section on their website, I asked ""can you please commentate our league?"" And the guy who was running the Call of Duty commentary section laughed it off and said, ""no way, your game is dead."" And I was like, ""I am not accepting this,"" and I made my own group. How did you go about producing your first game commentaries? It was possibly one of the worst ways you could have ever recorded an audio file. We used Windows Sound Recorder — there’s no way to throttle the levels, there’s no way to actually control it all, and you gotta do it in 10-minute blocks of recording. And then we uploaded the files later on. It was guys that didn’t know what they were doing trying to just blindly move forward. What year was this, when you created your first recordings? This would have been 2005 or 2006. It was just before my first major event. And you were still in Australia? Yeah, there’s no getting out of that. Once you’re in Australia, you have to work very hard to get out. So we did that, and it was obviously a disaster, but the community loved it. Then the marketing manager for Gamestah came over and said, ""what the hell are we doing, these guys have talent, why aren’t they part of our site?"" They invited us to join them, but I was like, ""no, because you told us to piss off before."" So they ended up just giving me the Call of Duty section. I took over from one of the other guys, and they passed on a couple of tricks of the trade on how to broadcast, which definitely increased our quality. It was a very expensive path to go. That was when we had to have two sound cards in one machine and a special way to hook up male-to-male cables to make it work. It was residential hotwiring of rigs to get them just to do what we wanted them to do. And even then, we only streamed out for like a maximum of 250 audio viewers. So we didn’t have video, it was all on audio, and even then we had to pay for the bandwidth we used — it’s not like the modern days with Twitch where you get paid with every viewer you have that watches an advert and you don’t even worry about the bandwidth costs. We had to pay for all the audio we used and when we first moved into video servers, that was a very expensive endeavor. At the time, were you streaming live alongside the matches? Yeah, there were different ways you could watch it. Sometimes, it was just audio, so it’d basically be like a radio — in fact, one of the groups in Australia was called netGameRadio, and Gamestah, before it went into video, was called Gamestah Radio — because that’s all you really had. But what we would do, we would provide the replays of the games and during the game we would tell people the time of the match so they could sync up their replay to the audio being played. With Dota, it was a little bit different because Warcraft had some third-party spectating options. Those you could actually watch live, but they were on a delay, so you could sync up the audio with the game itself and try and mesh everything together. So we ended up during every Dota game, every five minutes, giving a time mark. It’s a default thing that, even to this day, I now do by nature, saying something simple like ""we’re 32 minutes into the game."" That’s something I do just by reflex, because of how it all started. What was your first experience of commentating at a live event? Gamestah were the first group that took me to an international LAN. I went to Singapore for the World Cyber Games (WCG). That was my first time casting Dota as well, which was scary as crap, because I didn’t know the game. What happened then? Why were you casting Dota? It was a mistake. Because with World Cyber Games they do a whole bunch of different games, then they were just like, ""we need some English commentators for this,"" and our group was full of a whole bunch of FPS casters, so Call of Duty, Battlefield, Counter-Strike, they did them all. But what they didn’t do was Dota, which in Southeast Asia was the biggest thing. While WCG never declared it an official event — because obviously it wasn’t [Warcraft maker] Blizzard’s creation, there was no developer backing behind it, so it never really got paid to be in the WCG — it always had an event because it was always what the crowd wanted. I had basically played three public games of Dota with my mates, and that was it. Before the event, the Gamestah admin said, ""we’re going to Singapore, we got hired for this event, and we’re gonna do our Call of Duty and CS stuff,"" so I was like ""Call of Duty! Call of Duty! Send me!"",  but they’d already filled those slots. But they said, ""do you know anything about Dota?"" I said I’d played three games and knew it was called Defense of the Ancients, and they were like, ""well, you know more than we do,"" as they didn’t even know what the name stood for. So you wouldn’t have gone to the tournament as a Call of Duty commentator, but you made it there as a Dota caster? Yeah, because I played three pub games of Dota and then they sent me. Because I had more knowledge than anyone else in the group. It’s still hilarious what happened. They put me with two other guys from Singapore to cast with: a guy called Kell who works for Jelly TV (really nice guy), and another, I believe his name was Rupert, who was our expert — but I almost couldn’t understand a word he said! Because it was my first time in Singapore. Now I can travel to Singapore and understand everything everyone is saying around me, but back then the accent was so strong that I just had real trouble understanding what he said on the stage. And we didn’t have headsets. We were literally holding one microphone each and having it going over the PA system. So the PA was blaring down and we were all trying to listen to what each other was saying. It was a nightmare. But it was what we were thrown into, so you had to do it. I’m really happy that the audio recordings that we attempted to take at that event all failed. I basically commentated by describing what was in front of me, that’s always been a big strength of mine, so when I saw something like frosty coming across the screen, I would basically scream what I was looking at, and that was it. And then the other two would step in and give a little bit of analysis and I would just be like hype, hype, hype. But then I actually got the attention of a couple of the Singaporean guys. It was late on one of the nights and Call of Duty was low on the priority list of almost everybody, and we were burning into the late hours, but they needed to play one of the matches on stage (because when you promise something to a sponsor, you’ve got to deliver). So we played one of the games, which I knew was going to be a stomp, because I’d been casting these guys all the time from Australia. I knew the COD scene better than anybody else at that point. I was on the stage with a guy called Bob. That was actually his username, Bob, don’t ask me why; his real name was Neville. One of the very first commentators from Australia. He didn’t know Call of Duty at all. I was meant to throw to him all the time, but I ended up just casting so much that he felt he could walk away from the desk. Which was really bad as a commentator, but it kind of had an effect which for me was cool, because it told me what I was capable of doing. There was a small function going on. We were in a place called Suntec [Singapore Convention & Exhibition Centre]. There was a convention going on downstairs, just one floor down. The PA was up. But I got so hyped and made so much noise that people started coming from the lower level up, and actually coming to watch the game. And all the sponsors were really, really happy, because they were actually shutting down their booths because they thought everyone had gone, but then everyone was coming in so they turned their booths back on. Because we started bringing more people in. It was at that point when I was like, ""okay, commentary is awesome when it comes to LAN events, because you can do so much with it."" It’s so much fun. And that was when I understood it from the other point of view, the crowd point of view. I’d never been to an event where that many people were crazy about Dota or about anything. In front of the main stage, it was standing room only, and so many of the areas were taken up that you couldn’t see the game stage anymore. So the sponsors’ booths started putting Dota on their screens instead of their product ad rolls — just so people could watch from their box, and then they took pictures of all these people watching from inside their box. So they still got the exposure they were looking for. It was a fanatical movement, basically. Watching that many people going crazy for e-sports. How did things change after your first LAN event? That was, I believe, in 2005. I had been a volunteer commentator for just three or four months, and then they sent me to do this. It happened very quickly. After that, though, it was very slow. Very, very slow. It was basically grinding out the casts down in Australia. We traveled to a couple of LAN events here and there, but I was balancing a 40-hour work week as a retail manager with commentating at night. So you’re balancing a full-time job against what you want to have as your full-time job. Initially, when I was at university and trying to juggle it all, it was university and a fish & chips shop that I worked at. It was terrific. I hate fish and chips as a result now. It’s the smell of fish that’s so bad for me. But yeah, that was the first thing I juggled, but then I quit university because I wanted to pursue a career in gaming. I didn’t know where. At one point I even thought I could be a designer. I can’t draw for the life of me, but I thought I could get around that. I thought I could do C++ coding… hah! I read one book and I almost blew my own mind. And then I thought maybe I can make a career out of commentary. I saw that no one else was doing it at the time, apart from Joe Miller, who was one of the very few people that was paid — because he was part of ESL — to actually commentate. Then the question was how to do it and find ways to make it sustainable. There were a couple of things that came up, but so many of them were like ""three months here, six months here, gotta move to this country to do it, we just need you for a project, but it’s not a long-term project."" I had to pick up my entire life from Australia, move it, and then come back to absolutely nothing just for three months or six months, it didn’t make any sense. It wasn’t until I found this company, Freaks 4U in Berlin, where I thought, ""this sounds cool."" I get to build a project with a guy I already worked with, and they basically said, ""we’ll support you for one or even two years when you leave the country, and we’ll take care of everything else you need."" This was the most stable offer from anywhere, and even to this day, this company is one of the most stable jobs that you can get as a commentator. In Dota 2 at least. I guess the financial support was basically getting paid a salary. That’s enough, right? Yeah. I didn’t need much more than that. All I wanted was a roof over my head and an ability to cast 24/7. That was my only desire. Because I knew the thing I wanted to achieve, I could not do while working a full-time job. I had to be able to quit. Hence I came to Berlin because they gave me the ability to do so. This was at the start of 2011. The timing was actually really close, because I went from working here — and I was still streaming Warcraft 3 Dota —  to The International, which happened at Gamescom in the summer. So I was working here for four months before I cast TI.  And our company actually helped with that. Moritz Zimmermann, who was the project manager at the time, served as the tournament admin for TI1. Did you do the commentary for the TI1 finals? I did all of TI1. I cast every game. Every game you have recorded, it will be my voice and a guy called Slesh, who was a local German guy. He had very good knowledge of the Chinese teams so it made sense to bring him in. It’s such a serendipitous confluence of events. First of all, you get your big LAN opportunity as a Dota caster, but prove yourself by commentating on Call of Duty, the game you were already passionate and knowledgeable about. Then you move over to Germany and Valve just decides to host the biggest e-sports tournament ever in the same country. Just dropping it in your lap. Everything kind of worked nicely together. To be fair, though, it wasn’t just like I came here and Valve gave it to me. I cast more Dota 1 than any other English caster out there. Like I was casting every event from every corner of the globe. There was only one other person that came close to me in those early years and that was a guy named InvalidCola. Then Luminous did a lot from a place called DotaCommentaries.com, which doesn’t exist anymore, but that was one of the places where they’d record commentary on replays, they wouldn’t do it live. I was one of the only people that did it live. So with all that work, it was kind of a no-brainer for Valve to invite me. Was it always called joinDOTA or did you have a different name at the beginning? It was always joinDOTA from the start. Initially, the project was only my livestream on the website with a countdown. That was the original concept of the website. Then we thought we should probably have some forums, maybe we should do some news, perhaps a match ticker, and suddenly it built up. As I said before, everything has to evolve with the needs of the community. Because it all changes over time. Even some of the odd tournament formats that we used to have, none of them will run in this current day. Where were you before you moved to your present studios? We were in a place called WebTower. It was not as nice, or as nicely laid out, as this. My first studio here in Berlin was using the conference room, and there was no air conditioning, it was so hot, and I had lights on, I was stuck in a corner, it was so bad. But it was a room to cast in, and it was me doing it full-time, so I didn’t care. How rapidly did the quality of your production evolve? It definitely made a jump when I first came to our present studios. I finally had a real proper mixing desk, as opposed to my smaller ones that I had back at home. But it still took time. I was one of the few people that experimented a lot with gear; I was probably ahead of the curve most of the time. With my initial setups in Australia, it was basically a $10 microphone plugged into a very cheap computer. And then a couple of years down the line, we started looking at upgrading the audio, so I got a DJ desk, so I could cue music in and out. Our software started to evolve as well because there were more options. Even the basic things like Windows upgrading itself, allowing us to isolate all of the audio inputs inside of the Windows software itself, you used to not be able to do that. It was volume up and down, that was all. The ability to say, ""Skype is too loud, let’s drop it down by a bit,"" we didn’t have that option, so you had to isolate all the audio channels out. So yeah, software evolved and gave us more options. We started using Audacity for local recordings, because it was good quality and we could chop and change and mix that up. Did it crash for you? It always crashed. We lost so many files that way. We actually had special Audacity recovery programs. I don’t have to use any of that anymore. I’m very happy. Then we did something which was really stupid. We tried to make a PC / Mac hybrid. So we hacked Snow Leopard and put it onto a PC. Because Mac’s video gear was by far superior to anything the PC had. But we didn’t wanna spend $20,000. I was actually looking to take out a small loan from a bank to get a Mac that was capable of doing what we needed — almost signed the contract as well! But yeah, we chopped up this PC and found a way to add proper transition effects in. We got to a point where we made the production look basically like a news presenter’s desk. The only thing we didn’t have was a green screen. But it was really coolly done. How much of an investment did all of that added sophistication require? We had to have a separate machine just for that processing power. And then another one to record. And then another one to stream. It took so many resources, and so much money. I must have spent 50,000 Australian dollars in my time before I came here just upgrading machines and casting gear. It was intense. Especially when you gotta lock yourself in a small room. We didn’t have studio lights, we had floodlights at the start, which we bounced off the ceiling to try and dilute the lighting. And then we had like recording machine, streaming machine, gaming rig 1, gaming rig 2, and then the monitors all around us as well. We had to close the window, because I actually had the cops called on me multiple times because I commentated so loudly during the night while I was casting European matches. I was casting at like 2, 4, 5, 6AM in the morning. My neighbors complained so much, they called me saying the TV was turned on too loud. And then I had the police come and knock at my door, saying ""stop this,"" and then the complaint went on to my landlord and I almost got evicted at one point. The impression I’m getting is that, at least at the outset, the casters were also the engineers. You had to be responsible for both the broadcast and the infrastructure around it. Previously, I was a lot more. Not so much these days. Commentators are pretty spoiled these days where they can just sit down in a studio and just talk about the game. It’s a lot easier to be a commentator these days. Myself, I always like to know exactly what’s going on. If there’s something in the studio that I don’t understand, then I try and understand it. Because if it breaks, I need to know how to fix it. In this room, we still do our own production, which is why I have two mice in front of me while commentating: one is for my game stream and the other is for production. Is it fair to say that you had no choice at the beginning — you had to perform every role, wear every hat — but now there’s more opportunity to specialize? Yes, definitely. Though you’ve still got to understand that there’s not a hell of a lot of money in e-sports. So you need to find a way to justify hiring people to do production for you, it has to balance out. Why would I hire a second person if, with a bit of prep work, I can do something similar, maybe slightly lower quality, with just one? In a country with a required minimum wage, it’s more difficult than if you go to a place like Ukraine, where you can get a lot more people for the price of this one person here in Berlin. You can do a lot more in terms of manpower there, so it’s not as big of a problem. You still have to be very efficient with your money until, I don’t know, someone like Coke starts throwing $1 billion to sponsor a can on your screen. That would be wonderful. And will probably never happen. The beautiful thing for me is that there isn’t much advertising in your regular broadcasts, there’s no invasive marketing. How do you monetize your streams outside of the big events like The International? We try to keep it as non-invasive as possible. It always depends on the partners. Most of the time just having brand exposure is good, some sponsors just like to have their stuff displayed on camera. I personally try to move away from that, because I feel like there are a lot more effective ways to do advertising. Most advertisers would probably get more exposure by having memes created of their products. So you have like some certain catchphrase that triggers with the people who are watching, and when you stream to a platform like Twitch, for example, they never let it go, they bring it up every single time. Roccat experienced this with the ""Extend"" line that they had, and the entire chat would just basically spam out ""Extend!"" the entire time. And you’re sitting there as a sponsor and everyone is talking about your product, as opposed to the product just being there on the screen. The issue is justifying that then to a sponsor saying, ""these guys are saying ‘Extend’, but how does that relate to my product? Are these guys buying my products? Am I getting really good exposure?"" Are brands savvy about that? It’s not a quantifiable form of marketing. Every brand will probably be different. There’s not much of a chance of a 60-year-old executive at Coke, using that as an example again, seeing the value, but if you have someone that’s coming up through the ranks and is able to explain it, then you have better chances and you can form better partnerships. But you need to have someone who understands what they’re investing into. Are tournaments a big source of revenue for you guys? Whenever you can keep sponsors happy and keep sponsors involved, you can always keep yourself afloat. We work with multiple streaming platforms, because it gives more opportunities for either more tournaments or more avenues for revenue. Besides Twitch, we did some work with Azubu, own3D TV, and Dailymotion (they were willing to invest a lot more heavily than other groups). Right now, one of our strongest partnership outside of Twitch is with MLG, who sponsor the joinDOTA MLG Pro League. How do you feel about YouTube streaming? With YouTube, I am a massive fan of being able to stream to a new group of people. The ability to expose e-sports to people who haven’t seen it previously is perfect. You might know a couple of gaming channels with some weird guy who yells at a screen, and that’s the YouTube crowd, but they don’t really know about live content, it’s just video they can consume any time they want to. So showing them that there’s a live scene, that you’d actually book time out of your day because at this time this big game is going to happen and you wanna be there to watch it — to create that sort of mindset in a more casual community would be wonderful. I’m not against it. I’m all for for pushing e-sports into new areas. How it affects other platforms is also a good thing, because competition is always healthy for business. It’s forcing other platforms to upgrade. So I actually prefer YouTube over Twitch, because of its built-in DVR, and I’m not that enthusiastic about Twitch chat. Twitch provides a feeling that people like. With live streams, people want to have the feeling of a crowd. If the crowd is chanting something in chat, you get the equivalent in text on the side. And that’s where Twitch kind of has a power, because they are the mob. It goes back to the Roman Colosseum days: the power is the power of the mob. The ability to just move people. Twitch chat can be cancer or it can be fairies. It can be polar opposites every single time. Speaking of competition, how has the Dota commentary scene developed since you began? After the initial TI, we kind of got bogged down with just trying to get through the daily workload, to the point where we got a little bit stale. Groups like Beyond The Summit came up and brought in a fresh perspective, they brought in new talent. That was our first point where we really had competition. Then we tried to find ourselves by running a lot of small cups, which were initially praised for supporting the community, but then joinDOTA got the reputation as only casting small stuff. So it’s definitely been an experience moving around with joinDOTA, and it will continue to be an experience too. Right now, I feel like we’re one of the strongest groups out there. Why do people tune in to live streams, is it the games themselves, the commentary, or the players’ personalities? Most of the people follow the players themselves. It’s why it’s difficult to keep high stream viewers up unless you’re one of the personal streamers. Like Wagamama, for example, or SingSing. People tune in because their personalities reek of awesomeness. The studios used to have that flair, like people would tune in because I was casting, or they tuned to BTS because LD or Merlini was there, but that feeling is moving away, at least from my perspective looking at the community. You never know what you’re gonna get with the players’ streams, it’s all random, and people like that. You have to know your audience. How narrow is your audience? That’s the funny thing. When you actually look at how many people play and watch Dota, beyond TI, it’s actually a very small minority. I learned this when I was working in retail — I worked in the games section — and every day I had people come in and they’d buy their 360s and PlayStations and they really thought that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was where first-person shooters began. And playing with their mates was what it was all about. So your gaming audience is huge, but your e-sports audience is still tiny — and then you realize how many people you could probably expose to competitive gaming. But unless someone pushes to get into a new area and a new bunch of people, you continue to remain this small. ESL One Frankfurt 2015 was really terrific about this. They had a mechanical bull that families could come in and ride. They had a guy making balloon animals, Dota hero style, for the kids. You have all these different things that aren’t necessarily related to gaming, but you add a gaming touch to them, and that’s all you really need. That’s enough to where a mother can then bring like a 3- or 4-year-old and there’s some distraction for the kid to burn off steam during the day. It’s things like this that help expose e-sports to a more casual audience. In order for the scene to grow, the hardcore audience should definitely be catered to, but it shouldn’t be the focus. Do you think that’s part of your responsibilities? Initially with Dota 2, I felt like I had a lot of responsibility to push the scene forward because that’s what I did with Warcraft 3 Dota. There was never a developer behind it like Valve is with Dota 2, Blizzard didn’t even recognize Dota. So I kind of took it upon myself to try and shape the Dota 2 community into what I thought would be most beneficial. And then I realized that this isn’t my job. This is Valve’s job. The highest profile aspect of your job is still that you’re the play-by-play commentator for the most lucrative e-sports tournament. What tips or advice might you have for aspiring casters looking to follow in your footsteps? To somebody starting commentary? First, enjoy what you do. If you’re trying to cast a game that you don’t like, it’s going to show to your audience, and you’re going to start to hate yourself after a while. Be true to yourself and also understand who you are talking to. Understand that viewers probably won’t respect your opinion until they respect who you are and what you offer. The same thing goes with hype: don’t try and lie to your viewers with hype. Because if you do that, then they won’t believe you when there is real hype. It’s the ""boy who cried wolf"" scenario for commentators. More importantly, try and control your ego. This is something which every caster goes through at some point, where you believe you’re immortal because there’s a couple of guys who loved what you said, and then there’ll be a couple more guys, and they’ll keep piling up. And you’ll just be sitting there going, ""I can do anything I want to,"" and you’ll realize very quickly that when you do anything you want to, you will be shut down. Because you are not immortal as a commentator. A lot of us have learned that the hard way. There were a couple of decisions I made, TI2 being some of the worst ones I made, where basically I hurt my reputation and I’m really happy I was able to work really hard to get it back again. But I was lucky. Not everyone gets a second chance, and I was given a second chance. I’ll have to live with it forever. There’s still people out there that remind me of it every couple of weeks, in Reddit threads and the like. That’s something I’ve got to live with, it’s the price of the second chance.",0.2693251119858412,0.7306748880141588,0.17100926983987022,6142,4.3695864539238034,1684,6.2102137767220906,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Web, Interview"

The highlight feature of Logic 10.2 is Alchemy, a software synthesizer originally developed by Camel Audio before Apple snapped the developer up earlier this year. Alchemy can do a little bit of everything: it can create sounds using samples or multiple types of synthesis, including virtual versions of old-school analog synths. A plethora of filters and modulation options come as part of the package as well, offering a lot of potential sounds but also creating an array of combinations that could be next to impenetrable for many users. However, Alchemy also comes with a clever way of moving between different sounds that can make performing with the instrument as intuitive as swiping your finger across the screen of a tablet. Different sounds or parameters can be placed across the eight different segments of what Apple is calling the ""transform pad."" It's a simple grid, but as the user drags their cursor across the segments, the sound mixes and morphs fluidly, leading to what should be a much more playable, experimental experience than just fiddling with a bunch of virtual knobs (though users can dive down into that level of granularity as well). Right out of the box, Logic Pro users will have a lot of terrain to explore: Alchemy comes preloaded with over 3,000 presets.    GarageBand users got a sneak peek earlier this year The original versions of Alchemy ceased to be available for purchase when Camel Audio closed its doors this past January, but a simpler, streamlined version did made an appearance earlier this year in a recent GarageBand update. While not going under the name Alchemy, the update included the same segmented transform pad, highlighting the give-and-take Apple has been maintaining between the two products. Earlier this year GarageBand also gained the ability to share songs directly with Apple Music Connect, another feature that's coming to Logic today. Taken with the matching update to MainStage, which lets users play Logic's software instruments in a real-time, performance-oriented setting, Logic could now arguably be seen as an all-in-one creation studio, stretching across writing, recording, performing, and distributing music. Apple Music and Connect will need to become a bit more robust to truly earn that moniker, but if you want to check out Alchemy, Logic Pro X 10.2 is available now as a free update for Logic Pro X owners. You might want to make sure you have plenty of disk space available before updating, however: Alchemy comes with a healthy 14GB of additional samples.",0.7783295891334496,0.22167041086655037,0.18307154338135934,446,5.0874439461883405,263,6.1482889733840302,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Tech, Music"

The Santa Monica Mountains, plus a handful of neighborhoods and freeway exchanges, separate Hollywood from North Hollywood. For the past several months, it has been impossible to drive between these neighborhoods without passing a billboard advertising a YouTube star. Most often, that star is Grace Helbig, a 28-year-old comedian who recently crossed over, landing her own honest-to-god television show on E!. Viewership of The Grace Helbig Show tanked quickly — by its third episode, it was only drawing 182,000 viewers, causing the network to move it from Friday to Sunday night. Helbig, meanwhile, still posts videos for her YouTube channel, where she has 2.6 million subscribers. On a recent midsummer afternoon, Connor Manning was sitting in a Valley Village bistro, picking at his salad and considering Helbig’s level of celebrity, celebrity generally, and if that was what he really wanted. Manning is not famous. Except, perhaps, to the 64,000 people who were subscribed to his YouTube channel. That doesn’t sound like a lot, compared to the stars on the billboards, but it’s all relative. Sixty-four thousand people, he said — ""that’s an NFL stadium."" Manning had just had his hair cut, shaved close on both sides, slicked back for the most part though stray locks escaped to cover one of his two very blue eyes. He was anxious — his knees bobbed and bounced under the table. ""I’ve never been the one who’s been really assertive,"" he said. ""But I’m in a place where I’m trying to practice that and, like, faking it in a way."" He laughed. Just a few minutes earlier he had mentioned how hard he works to appear unguarded for his audience, his fans. If he wanted to develop his YouTube videos into a self-sustaining career, the kind where he wouldn’t have to wait tables on the side, he would need to present a more confident facade to the companies that control the pathways to larger audiences, more money, greater success. He’d need to fake it, maybe, or figure out another way. Manning, 22, had moved to LA exactly two weeks before I met him, driving across the country from his home in the Baltimore suburbs where, for the better part of five and a half years, he’d made videos of himself and posted them to his YouTube channel, AConMann. For now, he’s crashing at his friend Sasha’s apartment in Studio City, just over the hills from Hollywood. Ever since he was in high school and probably even earlier, Manning had dreamed of coming to LA to make it as a performer, because this is where performers go to make it. In recent years, the nature of Manning’s performance had evolved from something traditional — a zany sort of adolescent comedy act — into something more complicated, harder to pin down. At some point, his videos began to address much more of his own life: depression, addiction, bisexuality. His audience responded, his subscriber numbers steadily rose, and he began to think of what he was building as a viable, stand-alone career. Tomorrow, at VidCon, he would begin figuring out just what that career might look like, especially now that he was here, in LA. VidCon is a conference that began six years ago, mostly for YouTubers like Manning, but has since metastasized to include Viners and Snapchatters and even Facebookers too, along with hoards of their fans. The conference also draws industry people — the people Manning needed to fake it for, and the gatekeepers to becoming this new kind of celebrity. Among Manning’s earliest videos is one, posted five years ago and viewed 4,711 times, called ""Legit Old Guy."" In it, he narrates over a clip of a man parking a very small car in a very small garage. ""That guy should be the president of the world,"" Manning says, looking squarely into the camera. A lot of his early videos are similar: he either points to an already popular thing on the internet, or weighs in on an evergreen topic of internet discussion — Twilight’s vampires, Lindsay Lohan’s sexuality, the rise of Auto-Tune. Manning called his web series ""Generally Awesome,"" and even developed a tagline — ""I’m Connor Manning and you’ve just become a little more awesome"" — which managed to stick even after his videos became more personal. He dropped the tagline about five months ago. The talent Manning has for extemporaneous speech appears, in his videos, innate. But he had been practicing his public speaking years before he made his first video. In high school, he was a star on the speech team, competing at the state and national level. He was a fierce competitor, ruthlessly confident. Manning was, by all accounts, an ideal kid: a good student and son, endlessly goofy and positive. But he was troubled, too. His parents went through an ugly divorce; he never sees his biological father, and his stepfather was distant and the two never bonded. After high school, Manning went to George Mason University, where he began drinking heavily, grew depressed, and ultimately, considered suicide. The next, dark period of his life — dropping out, living at home, going through therapy, his addiction and depression — is something Manning avoids discussing in great detail. For someone who semi-professionally confesses to the internet, he remains incredibly guarded,  packaging his personal narrative in a way that insulates the messier, more intimate aspects. He doesn’t like to talk about what he was addicted to, specifically, nor does he talk about his depression in more than the broadest of strokes. On November 2nd, 2012, Manning posted a video called ""The Meaning of Life."" He knows this date by heart. The video signaled a definitive shift, the beginning of something new. ""I’ve been thinking a lot about time, and how crazy it is,"" Manning says in the video, launching into a brief and wide-eyed explanation of the theory of relativity. Then he reads questions from his audience. ""Have you ever had suicidal thoughts?"" someone asks. ""Please give me some advice. I think you’re going to have one less viewer."" ""Now, I could say a whole lot of things to this,"" Manning replies. ""Too many things ... The answer is Yes, I have had those thoughts. Everybody has horrible times but if that weren't the case ... the good times wouldn’t be worth it."" He goes back to the beginning, then the very beginning, the creation of the universe, and the improbable fact of our existence, born out of chaos. It’s not just how skillfully he connects his answer to the theme he’s previously laid out, but how he speaks from a place of deep experience without making it about himself. It’s universal. ""To feel means you exist, and existence, in my opinion, outweighs any negative thing that could happen,"" he says. It was the first time he’d ever done anything online that was not solely designed to be funny. It was personal and helpful, and it was, he says, his way forward, his crucible. At the end of 2012, he started attending community college, and, in the beginning of 2013, he got a job working customer relations at the National Aquarium. That got him out of his shell, and it also helped him save money for the move to LA he’d begun to imagine. Three years ago, he told his mom and stepdad that he wouldn’t be going back to university, that he wanted to pursue his dreams out West. In the meantime, his videos had become more personal, with titles like ""Falling for Straight People"" and ""Feeling Myself"" and ""Am I a Real Man"" and ""Would You Date Someone with Scars?"" If you watch Manning’s channel, you feel that you know him. His mom, Cathy Williams, watched his videos from the very beginning, even when she couldn’t quite understand just what the heck it was he was after. She says the videos allowed her to watch her son transform from a goofy guy who worked hard for a laugh, ""to just, like, an everyman."" None of Connor’s videos have gone viral, and he takes pride in that. It’s easy to make a viral video, he says, but it isn’t meaningful — a flash in the digital pan that doesn’t establish a connection with followers or guarantee a wave of new subscribers. ""I love my story individually, which is what I primarily tell, but I also like kind of validating everyone else’s story as well,"" he said that afternoon in the Valley Village cafe. I wondered aloud if he could monetize that. Connor told me that yes, yes he could; in fact he already had. Donations from viewers had helped him relocate cross-country. For the first time, he was being paid to attend VidCon. The first VidCon, in 2010, took place in the Hyatt Regency in downtown Los Angeles. It was put together by sibling YouTubers known as the VlogBrothers — John and Hank Green. (John, the older brother, is also author of the YA bestsellers-turned movies The Fault in Our Stars and Paper Towns.) Attendees of the first and second VidCon speak wistfully about how intimate, low stakes, and fun those conferences were. It was a place to meet your internet buddies in real life. Sure, there were industry folks then, too, but they mostly helped creators with little tricks to grow traffic and build audience. Back then the fans moved in smaller, more manageable packs — they were respectful, almost. It all felt very collegial. In its third year, VidCon moved to the Anaheim Convention Center, a much larger venue that sits next door to Disneyland. Industry people with serious money poured in. So did the fans. For Manning, VidCon has become the signpost of his year, a way to take stock. His mom came with him to his first VidCon four years ago, because he was still in rough shape, and because she was curious just what this YouTube world looked like up close. Even with her there, Manning snuck off, got trashed, and didn’t return her calls for a night. They had a big fight. Still, Manning met the people who inspired him to be better, not just in his videos, but in his life. About a month after VidCon, on July 22nd, 2012, he got sober. This year’s conference took place over three days in July. Thursday was ""industry day,"" a chance for the businesses that run the platforms to fly in, meet the talent, mingle, and be home to their families by the weekend. The real fan and creator stuff — the panels, the meetups — didn’t begin in earnest until Friday, and continued through Saturday. When I stepped into the enormous, airey outer atrium of the Anaheim Convention Center on VidCon’s first day, the first thing I noticed was the sticky sweet smell of teenage perfume and cologne. Across the convention center hall, packs of young adults with hair dyed in blues, purples, and rainbows huddled around power outlets, each other, and the occasional creator. On the second and third floors of the Center, the scene was decidedly more suit jackets and business casual. I kept climbing until I made my way to a balcony facing out over a line of food trucks, fountains, and a stage where stars from AwesomenessTV performed. Up here, the conversation circled around packaged content and talent incubation, crossed formats and investor appeal, cross-channel promotion and synergy, synergy, synergy. AwesomenessTV is a multi-channel network, or MCN, one of a slew of new and powerful talent incubators and content distributors to have emerged in the rush to the online video goldmine. For the very biggest YouTube stars — comedians, gamers, and unboxers of new products — it is not uncommon to make well over $1 million a year. According to the YouTube stat monitor Social Blade, an unboxer that goes by the name disneycollectorbr could be earning more than $1 million a month. Signing creators at that level is lucrative business. Even managing a dozen lesser stars, with several hundred thousand subscribers apiece, is enough to build a healthy media company. Though Manning exists in a lower and less profitable tier — creators with under 100,000 subscribers — he had had been signed to an MCN called Big Frame, which describes itself as a company ""building sustainable media brands around YouTube’s most influential channels, and connecting advertisers with their highly engaged audiences."" He ended his partnership with Big Frame in December; recently, the company was acquired by AwesomenessTV. Manning said he’d left Big Frame because the company’s advertiser-driven business model wasn’t what he was looking for. But advertising is where the serious money is and always will be, and the serious money, once it got very serious, is always with the same entrenched media companies: AwesomenessTV is owned by Dreamworks and Hearst; another major MCN, Maker Studios, is owned by Disney. The only newish player among the media behemoths is the platform itself, YouTube, which is owned by Google. Later in the day, in an auditorium bigger than all the rest, Susan Wojcicki, YouTube’s CEO, spoke to hundreds of her industry peers. The fans, she said, are ""leaning in"" and ""changing the definitions of what it means to be a celebrity."" A Variety poll from earlier this year found eight of the top 10 most famous, recognizable, and important celebrities to teens were YouTubers. During her presentation, Wojcicki unveiled a redesigned YouTube play button that looked like a diamond: a special button for special creators, with channels of 10 million subscribers or more. In mock awards show fashion, she presented physical, heavy-looking versions of the button to a few of the creators who were there: the Epic Rap Battles of History guys (12.4 million subs), the duo behind the comedy channel Smosh (21 million subs). Manning is aware of the push for ever greater numbers, and the opportunity at stake. He is tactical with the content he produces. He knew, for example, that when he made a video about his bisexuality, or a video called ""Too Gay, Too Straight,"" it would do well, because LGBT videos do well on YouTube. He could do one of those, then get away with maybe three or four weirder ones, maybe shot in a single take. ""I look at Hank, at what he’s done … and I just, I want to do that,"" Connor told me the day before VidCon. Hank is Hank Green. He is Manning’s hero, not just because of his success, but because he seems to have preserved exactly who he is despite it: a nerdy guy who makes videos about things he’s passionate about, and makes people passionate about those things, too. He’s a force for good in the world, Manning said. He also knew that Hank Green would be at VidCon, and there was a good chance they’d be in the same room at the same time, and maybe get a chance to meet, and talk, creator to creator. That would be cool, but he didn’t want to force it, make things weird. People were coming up to Hank Green all the time, wanting things from him, and he didn’t want to be one of those people. On the morning of his second day at Vidcon, Manning was slumped in a chair in the lobby of the Hilton, a stone’s throw from the convention center and where he and most attendees were staying. He was staring at his phone and double-checking a list of questions for a panel on mental health he would soon be moderating. Behind him, a line of weary, bleary-eyed parents snaked its way out of the hotel Starbucks. Manning yawned and stretched his long skinny arms dramatically, then placed his hands over his face. ""I’m tired,"" he said. Manning is often tired. For a while, his Twitter bio read ""a little bit tired."" Playing a version of himself for an audience of tens of thousands twice a week is bound to be draining. Plus, now, VidCon. The panel he was moderating featured Will Shepherd, Kati Morton, and Savannah Brown, who all work in a similar confessional vein to Manning. Brown is a poet, Morton is a therapist, and Shepherd is a gay man who had recently begun to grapple with PTSD and who has the largest audience of the bunch (208,000 subs). Half an hour before the panel was slated to begin, the room filled with attendees, gossiping about VidCons past. The panelists entered to huge applause. Manning asked them to introduce themselves, then asked how they ended up on YouTube. ""We’re kind of like the outcasts,"" Brown said. ""What I love,"" Shepherd said, ""is this is like where the weird kids go to express themselves,"" Then, later: ""None of us have massive channels, but we are all so raw."" Part of that rawness was, the group agreed, admitting when they did not always know the answer, that they were just figuring it out themselves. ""I really don’t know what I’m doing,"" Manning agreed. ""I’m living the experience and then making videos as my way through it. The drawback is people presume to know what I’ve been through or am going through. They come up to me and go, Are you okay? Are you okay? No, I’m fine. I’m fine. I’m just tired."" During the Q&A portion of the panel, a middle-aged woman in the audience stood and spoke to the room for a long time about how she saw millennials and post-millennials. They were all, in her eyes, spiritually lost. Eventually, Morton cut her off. ""Being lost isn’t a problem,"" she said, and the room erupted in applause. An hour after the mental health panel, there was an informal meet up, an LGBT hangout, outside the convention center. There was no line for autographs or selfies here; many of these fans were in fact old friends or people Manning had known a very long time online and occasionally in real life. Someone in the group described some of the Vine stars as looking like beautiful space alien creatures; another person in the circle fawned over Manning’s hair cut. Manning, uneasy with all the attention, pointed to a trash can. ""This is me. This is who I am,"" he said. Hank Green looks young for his age (which is 35), but old for VidCon. He has dimpled cheeks, slightly mussed hair, and the air of a hip, young dad. Green has interviewed President Obama, co-founded a record label, and invented a pair of 2-D glasses for people who want to watch 3-D movies in two dimensions. Beyond the Vlogbrothers channel he runs with his brother, Hank is involved with at least a dozen other YouTube channels. Two years ago, Green founded a crowdfunding company called Subbable, which let people who enjoyed the work of certain creators donate money to them, either through a one-time payment or a monthly subscription. In March, Subbable was acquired by Patreon, a much larger but still private company that essentially offers the same payment structure, while taking a 5 percent cut of all donations. Last year Patreon announced it paid  $1 million per month to its creators, of which there are more than 100,000; this year the company says its pledges have grown 500 percent, and that its 20,000 ""financially active"" creators are pulling from a monthly pool of millions of dollars. Manning is one of them. Currently, he makes $568.05 a month from Patreon donations. Seventeen of his ""patrons"" pay at least $25 a month, and, for their donations, receive a handwritten letter from Connor. It’s not a fortune, but that income — which he says is increasing — allowed him to move to LA, and will soon help him get his own apartment. Friday afternoon, after the morning’s mental health talk and midday LGBT meetup, Manning sat waiting for his turn on a series of filmed panels for UpLife, a YouTube channel for online communities against sexual violence. Hank Green was there, sitting near him, being filmed for another panel. Manning was extremely attuned to the way most people approached Hank at VidCon, treating him as an object, a celebrity. He didn’t want that. And so although they were in the same small room for nearly an hour, he and Green never spoke. Later, I talked with Green, and asked him about his path, and Manning’s, and if they were at all analogous; if Green’s career might shine a light on how Manning might come up, too. ""No,"" Green said. ""My path is not repeatable, but I don’t know of any path that is."" Someone could go from 10,000 subscribers to 100,000, he said, but beyond that, in today’s environment, things get murky. VlogBrothers, with their 2.6 million subscribers, have been around a relatively long time — eight years to YouTube’s 10. Their channel grew popular organically — a remarkable feat and an increasingly difficult proposition in 2015. The reason is simple: there’s simply too much money on the line. Green said that in order to develop a very popular, sustainable franchise with millions of subscribers in this new, moneyed era, you need institutional support: MCNs eager to promote your brand through their other, more popular talent and channels, or connect you to high paying branded deals. It all meant faster access to resources (money, better cameras, lighting, stages) that could free you up to make loads of content. But in time, Green said, that support ""goes from enabling you, to people or companies asking you to do things for them, because they gave you money."" There is, however, another, hidden landscape. On Twitch.tv, a tip-based, live-streaming video game platform (bought by Amazon last year for $970 million) gamers make a decent and sometimes great income with modest but extremely dedicated audiences. ""You can have 10,000 viewers and make a better living than the million-plus guys,"" Green said. All you needed was to become the thing — the podcast, the song, the video, the habit — for some people, and they’d pay $5 a month for you. Manning knows that to build a career, he needs to think beyond YouTube subscriber numbers — he needs to build an audience that will zealously follow him to Snapchat, or Facebook, or some other platform that doesn’t exist yet. It’s a business reality that Manning is innately attuned to. ""Essentially I don’t think people are following my videos,"" Manning had told me over our first lunch in Valley Village. ""I think they’re following me, as a person."" Outside, after the panel, I asked Manning if he was sorry he didn’t get a chance to talk to his hero. He shrugged. ""Of course I am a little bummed,"" he said, ""but also not really. Because I know it will happen. I know I am exactly where I need to be."" Back in the San Fernando Valley, a few days after VidCon, Manning was draped across the couch at his friend Sasha’s apartment. Manning’s bedroom consisted of a mattress in the corner of the living room, clothing confettied in piles around it. He waved his hand at the scene and said, ""This is it. This is home, for now."" Over the three days at VidCon he’d gained about a thousand subscribers. He’d met a bunch of new creators. He’d moderated a panel and nearly met his hero. Still, he was rootless and in a post conference malaise. At least, he said, he was in decent health: he hadn’t caught the VidCon Virus, a flu-like disease born out of the annual confluence of teens, their germs and hormones rampaging. He needed an apartment. Without a home, he said, he felt like he was still drifting. This VidCon, he said, had felt different than previous ones — he was actively building a business, developing a strategy. In the end, he didn’t have to fake it as hard as he thought he might. People seemed to know him already. ""I didn’t have to explain what I do,"" he said. He was, he said, being courted by a few MCNs, but he wasn’t interested in a contract. ""Not until I know I can be a priority for companies,"" he said. ""I really want to have some negotiating power, because I don’t want to be treated as an afterthought again."" He was looking into the idea of partnerships. A few weeks after Vidcon, he did a branded video, his first in years, for a company called Famebit. It felt different than similar projects he’d done with Big Frame — he was in control, and didn’t feel like he was diminishing who he was, his own brand. With the money from that, and Patreon, he’d be able to pay rent off internet work alone. Recently, Manning texted me: he’d signed a lease. A bouquet of exclamation points followed. It was a studio near his friends in the Valley, not too far from the hills. Beyond them was Hollywood proper, with its billboards of YouTube stars standing right alongside movie stars, reality TV stars, pop stars. He’d be living alone for the first time. He was getting closer to where it was all happening, and he could, he said, finally start building something on his own. It felt like the real beginning of this new stage, finally.

And if anything in gaming could get away with that endless repetition, it might be Shadowrun Returns. The series was one of the earlier Kickstarter video game reboots, with an impeccable geek pedigree — it’s a successor to a video game adaptation of a 25-year-old tabletop role-playing game, set in a world that mixes J.R.R. Tolkien’s supernatural races with William Gibson’s ‘80s futurism. But Shadowrun Returns isn’t just a throwback, it’s an excellent creation in its own right: a smart and addictive combination of turn-based fighting, meticulous character building, and virtual social maneuvering. It’s difficult enough to feel challenging, but not so hard that you can irrevocably break something and only find out three hours later. It offers clear choices, but there may be no obviously “right” blanket answer, and the biggest consequences are your own moral qualms. It’s the purest iteration of RPGs’ particular brand of escapism: a string of new lives where you get to pick exactly what you’re good at, the world is built to accommodate it, and you can always start over if you fail. Shadowrun: Hong Kong, released last week, is the third campaign, but it’s the rebooted series’ first real upgrade. It’s got the same look and feel as the original Shadowrun Returns, the same basic mechanics, and the same hardboiled writing style. But it’s also a lesson in how to — and how not to — keep the core elements of a game while pushing their limits. Every single Shadowrun game begins the same way: your character arrives in a city on the instructions of an old acquaintance. Within ten minutes, that person will be dead, and you will have to find their killer. To do this, you will enter a dangerous underworld full of hackers, shamans, megacorps, dragons, megacorps run by dragons, and street samurai. The repetition is a good indicator of what the series delivers: a mashup of comfortable tropes (are any two genres more overused than high fantasy and cyberpunk?) that meld into a piece of competent, thoughtful, and creative design. The latest installment sets its narrative ambitions higher than usual. Cyberpunk has often used East Asian imagery as exotic window dressing, but Shadowrun: Hong Kong tries to incorporate future-fantasy versions of feng shui (including a slightly tongue-in-cheek mission about sabotaging a geomancy consultancy by disrupting its qi) and Triad gangs as integrally as it does elves and European anarchists. And the game frequently pulls it off — partly through its general cosmopolitanism, and partly because it’s usually too interested in the minutiae of characters’ lives to reduce them to stereotypes. Hong Kong’s characters are connected in a way that previous games in the series haven’t managed. Instead of being thrown together by circumstance, they have clear networks of friends, relatives, and criminal partners. This includes the protagonist, who spends the game butting heads with their estranged foster brother while searching for their surrogate father. Writing people that the player character knows but the player doesn’t can push conversations towards awkward ""as you know"" exposition, which the game sometimes falls into. For the most part, though, it turns character development into a minigame. Branching conversations let you pick what you want to remember about your past, and everyone else responds as if they’d known all along. The system doesn’t seem all that complex, but it was deep enough to make me feel bad when someone commented that they never really got to spend time with me, right before the end of the game. (I also, it turns out, missed out on some quests by ignoring everyone outside  missions.) Underneath the standard corporate intrigue and double-crosses, Hong Kong also has a new and uniquely creepy tone. You’re soon at the center of a conspiracy involving some shady civil engineering and an otherworldly nightmare, and the first half of the game effectively builds a sense of foreboding: you’ll pass through a nearly deserted Kowloon Walled City, some eerie interstitial dream sequences, and a moment where your own teeth start falling out. These elements, though, feel like they’re straining against the game’s capabilities. Hong Kong’s relatively simple visual style allows for a large, diverse cast without expending too many resources — maybe because swapping out genders is such an integral part of RPG character creation, it’s got more female characters than almost any other game I can name. It also allows the game to simply describe things it can’t show, putting a block of text over a highly stylized scene. But it’s a victim of its own success: the more surreal and evocative the scene, the more I want to see it instead of read about it. Every design tweak reveals how delicate a balancing act the Shadowrun series pulls off. You don’t need to know anything about previous campaigns or the original tabletop rules to play Hong Kong, but it only explains its many systems in the virtual equivalent of a low-profile user manual, so it relies on players broadly understanding what kinds of characters they can build and how they should approach missions. Hong Kong is longer than earlier campaigns — I finished it in 21 hours, without some optional quests — and its fight scenes and conversations can feel a little too long, noticeably throwing off the pacing. It’s especially frustrating when you end up in a place that plays to your weaknesses, like being a shaman in a tech-obsessed community or a hacker in a brawl. Hacking — sorry, ""decking"" — is a case where thematic effectiveness doesn’t equal satisfying gameplay. Previously a series of straightforward turn-based battles, it’s now broken up by stealth sequences and memory puzzles. It’s far better at evoking the sense of sneaking through a network undetected and deciphering its codes. Unfortunately, because Shadowrun’s point-and-click controls aren’t good at precise movement, it’s also miserable. Tripping alarm after alarm because I clicked a couple of ticks too far or couldn’t see a virtual camera didn’t feel difficult so much as arbitrarily cruel. In order to really do justice to its ideas, Hong Kong would need to be a different game: one with an art style that was built specifically for its horror elements and controls built for its new mechanics. I’m not sure it’s the strongest overall segment; Dragonfall, the second campaign, is a great contender. But there’s so much good in the formula that changing it feels unnecessary. Should I feel bad for wanting to play variations on the same thing over and over? Potentially. But in some sense, that’s the point. The Shadowrun Returns series isn’t a story, it’s a style — a set of opportunities and restraints for its developers to experiment with. Hong Kong isn’t a perfect fit, but it’s a worthy addition.

Rovio came to prominence in 2009 with the success of the first Angry Birds game on iOS, and has since tried to build on that with a near-overwhelming amount of Angry Birds merchandise and spinoffs. Most recently, the developer released Angry Birds 2, a free-to-play game that saw more than 50 million downloads in its first month of availability. However, that success wasn't enough to make up for the company overextending itself. ""Rovio's growth and eagerness to explore new business opportunities over the past few years has been exceptional,"" Rantala said. ""As a result, we did too many things. In our current financial condition we must now put focus on where we are at our best: in creating magnificent gaming experiences, in producing an amazing animation movie and in delighting our fans with great products.""",0.5550681831713261,0.4449318168286739,0.2862966087174518,283,5.1024734982332154,181,5.9779005524861875,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming"

Since its debut in 2009, the game has sold more than 70 million copies across multiple platforms and spawned countless forms of merchandise, from bestselling books about crafting to those blocky action figures lining your local toy aisle. It’s been used as an educational tool and a social hub, and last year Microsoft spent $2.5 billion to acquire Mojang, the studio behind the game. Creator Markus “Notch” Persson has become so wealthy that he recently outbid Jay-Z and Beyonce on a $70 million mansion in Beverly Hills. Along the way, players have not only crafted their own maps and items, but also their own stories. Minecraft is essentially an open sandbox, without a traditional narrative guiding you. Instead, the story of Minecraft is the one you make, the tale of how you and your friends play together, and the things you build.  But that’s about to change — sort of. Telltale Games, the studio best known for narrative-driven adventures like The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones, is working on a new title that aims to bring a more traditional narrative to the Minecraft universe. Called Minecraft: Story Mode, the first of five episodes is set to debut later this year, and it’s a completely separate experience from the main game. Telltale knows that, while this is the first official game of in the franchise with a narrative, it’s far from Minecraft’s definitive story. “The desire to tell stories in the world of Minecraft isn’t necessarily new, it comes from the community, and we’re huge fans and part of that community ourselves,” says Job Stauffer, director of creative communications at Telltale. “Collaborating with Mojang to tell a Minecraft story, and not the story, is perhaps just first time fans will get to see something done in a more official capacity.” First announced last December, Story Mode is very similar to Telltale’s previous work. Since the success of the first season of The Walking Dead, the studio has been continually improving its very specific brand of interactive storytelling. Telltale games are almost like interactive TV shows: they’re divided into a series of episodes, released roughly once every month or two, and are more about making difficult decisions than conquering tough challenges. Games like The Wolf Among Us often have players making heart-rending choices, where other characters will die no matter what you do. Telltale games are regularly violent and shocking, so the news that the studio would be working on a family-friendly franchise like Minecraft came as a surprise to many. The idea has been kicking around inside the San Rafael, California-based studio since 2012. At that time, Telltale was ramping up its work on the then unannounced Tales From the Borderlands, a story-driven take on the popular shooter series. That project led to thinking about which other video game franchises might fit the Telltale formula. Minecraft was near the top of the list. ""Borderlands was the challenge of telling the story of what happened next on an existing canvas,"" explains Stauffer. ""Minecraft was the challenge of telling a story for the first time on more of a blank canvas."" Early talks with Mojang started in early 2013, and a year later work on the game officially began. ""When we first announced this partnership, we think some fans thought this was the result of a partnership at Microsoft, unaware that Mojang and Telltale were working together long before that,"" he says. Story Mode will put players in the role of Jesse, an in-universe character voiced by Patton Oswalt, who along with his friends idolizes the Order of the Stone, a group that famously defeated the powerful Ender Dragon boss. For reasons that we don’t yet know, Jesse and his crew are forced to find the Order in order to stop a catastrophe from destroying the video game universe. The characters are all designed to represent different kinds of players — some like to build things, other like to explore — and Telltale says that the tone of the story will be reminiscent of ‘80s films like The Goonies and Ghostbusters, which blend action and comedy in a family-friendly way. (Goonies star Cory Feldman is even among Story Mode’s voice cast.) ""There was something magical about that generation of film before the PG-13 rating became commonplace that bred an incredible body of inspiration for us,"" says Stauffer. Like the studio’s past work, Story Mode will hinge on making big, important choices that impact how events play out — but it obviously won’t be anywhere near as dark as games like The Walking Dead where characters are killed off with alarming frequency, often in gruesome ways. That said, the decisions will still be tough, and Stauffer says that you’ll be up against ""absolutely devastating, perilous situations that might mean leaving one friend behind in order to save another."" He adds that ""while the presentation of a choice may not be as M-rated as you’d find in Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead, the element of empathy and the pressures of guilt will still be present."" The goal is to make a game that will appeal to both new players and Minecraft fans at the same time. Think of it like the Pokemon cartoon; you can enjoy it on its own, but if you play the game as well you’ll get a lot more out of it. You may learn tips for how to play, or even just see cool stuff you might have gotten to in the game. ""We know what it’s like to craft, to hunt, to build, to survive, and to play with friends and grow a community,"" Stauffer explains. ""But imagining those ideas as happening through living characters in conversations — friends trying to stick together, aspiring to do something legendary, or simply trying to have fun building something together – it becomes a completely different way of experiencing everything you’ve already done in this universe, or perhaps even things you have yet to do. Not every player may have faced an Ender Dragon or journeyed into the Nether – but many of these characters have. In that way, certainly we’re shedding light on some things not every player may be aware of."" Story Mode doesn’t have a specific release date just yet, but the first episode is expected to debut before the end of the year. And it’s coming to a huge range of platforms, including the Xbox One and 360, PS3, PS4, PC, Mac, Android, and iOS. Telltale has also revealed to The Verge that the game will be coming to the Wii U as well, marking the first time a Minecraft game launches on a Nintendo platform. One of the goals is to reach outside of the Minecraft fandom, and introduce new people to the franchise. But with an existing audience of 70 million, Telltale also knows that keeping them satisfied is the most important thing. ""We’re tailoring this for audiences both existing and new,"" says Stauffer, ""but Minecraft fans are really at the core of the themes here.""

It's a more powerful and more capable iPad than ever before, and it comes with something many thought Apple would never sell with an iOS device: a stylus. It's called the Apple Pencil, and it includes pressure sensitive technology and can be used simultaneously with a finger. Pressing lightly will produce a thin stroke, while firmer pressure can result in a heavier, darker stroke. That's similar to how Samsung's S Pen works on its various Note smartphones and tablets. The Pencil is an active stylus and is recharged via a Lightning connector hidden inside its body. It can recharge right from the iPad Pro's port and Apple says a full charge offers 12 hours of use. If you're in a hurry, a mere 15 seconds of charging can add 30 minutes of usage time to the Pencil. Physically, the Pencil is round, which means it could roll off your desk fairly easily, and it's much longer than the many third-party styluses that have been available for years.   Apple says that a variety of its own apps will support Pencil, including the new Notes and Mail apps in iOS 9. It will also work in third-party apps, including Microsoft's Office suite for the iPad. Adobe's suite of Photoshop apps for the iPad are also being updated to support the Pencil.

PowerPoint has great support for the Apple Pencil, allowing you to convert ink into objects in slidedecks.   Microsoft wasn't the only surprise addition to Apple's iPad Pro announcement. Adobe joined the stage to demonstrate several apps running on the iPad Pro. Adobe Photoshop Fix is a new app for iOS that allows you to retouch images quickly. Adobe has built facial detection into the app, allowing you to retouch faces with ease. Adobe Sketch has also been tuned to work with the Apple Pencil, with support for the pressure sensitivity and multitasking between other iOS 9 apps. Aside from apps and power, the new iPad Pro also includes a Touch ID sensor and support for LTE. Apple has placed an 8-megapixel iSight camera on the rear, and a FaceTime HD Camera at the front. Apple is planning to release the iPad Pro in November in silver, gold, and space grey finishes. A 32GB model starts at $799, while a 128GB version is priced at $949. If you want to opt for LTE then the only choice is the 128GB model that comes in at $1,079. Apple isn't bundling the Apple Pencil or Smart Keyboard with the iPad Pro, though. You'll need to pay $99 for the Pencil alone, and $169 for the keyboard.",0.6192856257836967,0.3807143742163033,0.1829953962073574,428,4.6004672897196262,223,5.6053811659192823,0,74,"Apple, Apple iPhone 6s announcement, Tech, Breaking"

The Smart Keyboard uses key domes that Apple first developed for the new MacBook announced earlier this year and connects to the iPad Pro using a new connector type — the Smart Connector — which means that it's not connecting over Bluetooth. The entire keyboard is cloth, which won't likely be as easy to use as a traditional keyboard — even the limited-travel one on the MacBook — but it's still a step up from a virtual one. (Interestingly, this isn't the first keyboard accessory Apple has made for the iPad: the company made a ""Keyboard Dock"" with a 30-pin connector, but it wasn't particularly portable — and it certainly didn't double as a cover.)

We got two new iPhones, a revamped Apple TV, a massive iPad, and a few surprises. Here's all the news. I have mixed emotions about Apple moving online iPhone pre-orders from a weeknight to a weekend; on the one hand, this means that many of us won't be getting turnt on a Friday. On the other hand, there won't be any bleary, dead-eyed workers collapsed at their desks the next morning. You win some, you lose some.  T-Mobile CEO John Legere isn't one to let the introduction of a new iPhone pass by without using it to drum up interest in his company, and this time he's doing it by offering an extravagant deal on Apple's latest flagship phones. In a blog post and video today, he announced that T-Mobile will be offering the iPhone 6S for $20 a month through the carrier's Jump on Demand program, with the 6S plus going for $24 a month. Jump on Demand is an 18-month leasing plan which allows customers to... Yesterday Apple unveiled a new version of the Apple TV, and for the first time, it can play video games. But in typical Apple fashion, games were far from the core focus; they’re  just one relatively small aspect of what the set-top box can do, a bonus on a device meant for watching TV and movies. Compared to a modern game console, the Apple TV is underpowered with a sparse lineup of games, so it’s unlikely that it will go head to head with the Xbox One or PlayStation 4 anytime soon. But it... It’s easy to get lost in Apple’s torrent of disparate announcements yesterday and miss the common purpose to them all. But there was indeed a shared, unifying strategy at play, and that was the pursuit and maintenance of high profit margins. Viewed through the unemotional prism of ""how much money do I make from every unit sold?,"" there’s a perfect congruence between the diversity of new Watch bands, the content-focused reboot of the Apple TV, and the launch of the large and expensive iPad... The iPad Pro was only just announced, but we're already starting to see third-party accessory support. Logitech, which makes some of the most popular keyboards for existing iPads, is introducing a line called Create that has been designed in collaboration with Apple. What this means is that Logitech knew about the iPad Pro's Smart Connector ahead of time. The Create keyboard will attach directly to the iPad Pro and start working right away — no need for pairing or charging. Logitech isn't... By Apple standards, today's event was a blockbuster, covering major product updates in three different categories. One is notable, two is a party, but seriously — three? We're still catching our breath. Read next: The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus review. The good news is that you don't need to sit through a two-hour presentation to catch up on all the news if you don't want to — using the magic of modern technology, we've been able to compress the event down to a far more digestible 8 minutes. Sit... Apple announced the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus today. And if you want one, Apple would like you to think that it's business as usual. You can preorder them starting September 12th, and they'll be available on September 25th. The 16GB iPhone 6S starts at $199 on-contract, and 64GB and 128GB versions will be available for $299 and $399, respectively. The 5.5-inch iPhone 6S Plus is priced slightly higher at $299, and it too is available in 64GB and 128GB options ($399 and $499, respectively). Easy. T... The guys at FiftyThree can't catch a break. First Facebook named its biggest and best app Paper, copying the name of FiftyThree's earlier iPad drawing app, and now Apple has named its new stylus a Pencil, just like the iPad accessory FiftyThree already sells. We reached out to the company, which is growing increasingly reliant on hardware sales of its Pencil for its income, to ask how it will react to Apple's new launch. The answer is equivocal, as it neither derides nor entirely welcomes... The new iPhone has today been unveiled and it looks very much like the old iPhone, except for one variation: the iPhone 6S now also comes in pink. Or rose gold, in Apple parlance. It's still the perfectly chiseled metallic leader of the smartphone world, but now it's wearing a gentler shade of aluminum skin. How are we going to deal with that? In a world where the best technology is usually dressed up either aggressively or austerely, is there room for a globe-conquering phone dressed like... Every time Apple announces a new iPhone model everyone suddenly starts wondering if theirs is good enough. The company apparently wants to encourage this feeling, and has quietly dropped the gold color option for older iPhone models — reserving it for the new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. Its online stores (in the US and abroad) no longer offer the gold option for the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, or iPhone 5S, and Apple has confirmed to The Verge that the finish is being discontinued for these models. That's... Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are still some of the best phones on the market today, but are dogged by a particular design flaw: they bend. Last year, numerous early adopters (and even Verge reporters) discovered that the devices bent over time, culminating in a weeks-long dustup known as #Bendgate. Update: Read the Apple iPhone 6S review. While the furor quickly died down, Apple may have taken the complaints to heart. At today's event in San Francisco, the company stated that the new iPhones... Apple TV's new remote has a touch pad, motion controls, and a few buttons, all of which will help it double as a video game controller. The remote's design — a thin candy bar of plastic that can be used both vertically and horizontally — should be identifiable to anyone who has used Nintendo's Wii. The Apple TV Remote Loop in particular looks identical to the Wii Bracelet, both harnesses wrapping around the wrist of their respective hand model. According to Apple's press materials, though,... Apple events can usually be referenced based on the one flagship they focus on: the iPad event, the iPhone event, the Apple Music event. That doesn’t work quite as well with today’s news-packed event. The company officially delivered on two long-overdue rumors: it refreshed the Apple TV, and it unveiled a giant, almost laptop-like iPad. The iPad Pro is a 12.9-inch behemoth with a matching stylus and keyboard, seemingly designed to fill the same market Microsoft is going after with the... Phil Schiller announced a few new iPhone camera tricks at today's Apple event, but one of the strangest was something called ""Live Photos."" Think of it as a something between automatic GIFs and short video clips. Read next: The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus review. Every picture you take with the new iPhone 6S or 6S Plus is, by default, also a Live Photo. The camera app captures a second and a half on either side of the photo that you take, and when you tap the photo it will animate. (It will also... Every other year, Apple releases an iPhone that many people write off as a spec bump. Sure, it has a better camera, faster processor, and various other small improvements — but most people just think of it as an iterative update over the ""real"" new iPhone that comes with a new version number. But to think that this year would be a serious mistake. Yes, the new iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus look basically the same as their predecessors — but the changes Apple has made to the camera, processor,... As expected, Apple announced an updated version of the Apple TV today, and I just spent a little time playing with it. Physically, the unit itself isn't much different than the older model — it's just a little bit taller — but the remote and interface are entirely new. The remote is a slim wand with a touchpad at the top; menu, home, volume, Siri, and volume buttons; and motion sensing capabilities. The mic for Siri is at the top, as you'd expect, but you shouldn't have to actually hold it... Apple today announced the iPhone Upgrade Program, a new initiative that will let consumers buy new, unlocked iPhones from the company and move up to the new flagship model every year. It's similar to the upgrade plans offered by many US carriers, but this is Apple taking control of the entire experience; you're buying an unlocked phone direct from Apple that'll run on Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and others. Choose your own carrier, and pay Apple for the phone over time. Update: Read... Apple has announced a new pricing scheme for its iCloud storage, halving the prices of some options. 50GB of cloud storage data now costs $0.99 a month (compared to the previous lowest plan of 20GB for the same price), while 200GB costs $2.99 a month and 1TB of storage will set you back $9.99 a month. (These two options previously cost $3.99 and $19.99 respectively). It's not clear whether the old 500GB plan will continue, or if Apple has dropped this option completely. Apple's new mobile operating system finally has a release date. iOS 9 will be available on September 16th across the world. The date was announced on stage at the company's latest product keynote, alongside new hardware including the Apple TV and the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. iOS 9 was first announced at WWDC in June, and was made available as a public beta the following month, but this will be the first official release for the operating system. Update: Read the iOS 9 review. The company did... Ever since 2009's 3GS, Apple's entry-level iPhone has had 16GB of storage for apps, games, photos, music, video, and whatever else you can put on your smartphone. Six years ago, 16GB was plenty of storage for the puny 3-megapixel images the iPhone 3GS captured. Today, Apple announced the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, which start at, you guessed it, 16GB of storage. Pricing for the new phones starts at $199 on contract or $649 outright. Purchased on an installment plan, the new phones will cost $27... The camera has long been a focus point for each new iPhone, and the one in the brand-new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus is no different. The new 12-megapixel camera represents a significant leap in resolution over the 8-megapixel cameras the iPhone has had since 2012. Apple says the new camera also has improved autofocus and improved pixels for better color and image quality. The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are also capable of capturing 4K video, a first for iOS devices. Read next: The iPhone 6S review. T... Get ready to scale El Capitan. The latest version of Apple's OS X operating system for Macs will be shipping from September 30th, according to a demo email message shown briefly onstage at this year's product keynote and later confirmed on Apple's site. The update, which has been available as public beta since July, is a relatively small update for OS X, focusing on two major areas: ""Experience"" and ""Performance."" The former is all about integrating Apple's own apps more tightly than ever... At its fall event today, Apple announced that it's adding something called 3D Touch technology to its new iPhones, meaning the screen can sense multiple levels of pressure. The feature first appeared in simpler form on the Apple Watch as ""Force Touch,"" where it can be used to clear all notifications with a single press. In the iPhone, a system measures the distance between the glass and the backlight to detect how hard the user is pressing. Read next: The iPhone 6S review.  Apple is introducing the iPhone 6S, an updated version of its flagship smartphone with an identical design and a bundle of new features. Chief among them is a pressure-sensitive display, enabling a feature that Apple calls 3D Touch. 3D Touch allows you to press down on the iPhone's screen to pull up new menus, activate shortcuts, and generally interact with the device in new ways. Apple's Taptic Engine is also built into the phone to provide feedback. The features will also appear in  the new... There's a new iPhone, and so of course there must be a new iPhone Plus as well. After running through some stats illustrating the iPhone's remarkable growth in China, Tim Cook introduced this year's generation, called the iPhone 6S. ""The only thing that's changed is everything,"" says Cook. ""These are the most advanced smartphones in the world."" The new Apple TV remote supports motion controls, and it looks like Apple is taking a leaf out of Nintendo's book when it comes to teaching new users how to play games on the device. Harmonix, the developers behind Rock Band and the original Guitar Hero, appeared on stage to show off a new game called Beat Sports — and, well, it's pretty much Wii Sports baseball in rhythm game clothing. Players can swing the Apple TV remote to hit balls in time to music, combining ""the joy of hitting balls... At Apple's ""Hey Siri"" event in San Francisco today, the company finally unveiled its long-brewing update to the Apple TV. It's the biggest revamp the set-top box has seen since its debut in 2007, and, with a bevy of new features already built in, including deep Siri functionality, it's clear this interface is all about content more than any one channel. When Apple Music was unveiled in June, an Apple TV app for the service was curiously absent. Now, it's finally arriving, along with an overhaul of both Apple TV's hardware and software. On stage at this year's product keynote, Apple showed off Apple Music, with Eddy Cue promising the same features as you can find on iOS and Macs — access to your own music library, personalized playlists, Beats 1 Radio, and 30 million songs. Presumably, there will also be integration of some sort with Siri,... Look, I don't run a billion-dollar company. I don't even run a company. But I have this crazy idea for Apple and Adobe and any other company. If you're going to give a presentation that will be seen all over the world, consult as diverse an audience as you can. You have the money. You have the time. Today, Adobe used its portion of the Apple event to demonstrate an impressive suite of apps that allow iPad Pro users to manipulate and layout images and text. But the way they did it was creepy... From the iPhone to iPad to Apple TV, Apple is going all-in with Siri. Apple is empowering its personal assistant, beefing up its capabilities in iOS 9 and today during its iPhone Event, it made Siri the centerpiece of its brand new Apple TV, and its main input device. The new Apple TV comes with universal voice search, powered by Siri. iTunes, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Showtime — it can all be searched by just saying the name of a movie, director, or actor. The new remote comes with a built-in... Video games are finally coming to the Apple TV. At an event today, Apple revealed a new version of its set-top box, and for the first time games will be available on the device thanks to a new App Store. The new Apple TV also includes a new remote with a touchpad, and as expected, it also features Wii-like motion controls thanks to a built-in accelerometer and gyroscope. Some of the first titles revealed for the device include Crossy Road, Rayman Adventures, Transistor, a mobile version of G... In conjunction with the announcement of the new Apple TV today, Apple took the wraps off a new remote control — and it's got a lot going on. A touch-sensitive glass surface serves as the primary means of input, but the remote also support for Siri as Apple pushes its voice assistant deeper across its product portfolio. It can also be turned sideways and used for gaming. Other buttons include Menu, Play / Pause, TV, and a volume rocker. (Missing are forward and rewind controls, but presumably... The long-awaited overhaul to Apple's living room set-top box is here. Today the company is unveiling its latest Apple TV with a revised physical design, faster internals, updated remote, and key new features including a built-in App Store. ""It's the golden age of television,"" said CEO Tim Cook. ""Our vision for TV is simple and perhaps a little provocative. We believe the future of television is apps."" The new Apple TV is much more powerful than its predecessor, which is a crucial upgrade for... Here's a big question: what is the iPad Pro? It's the size of a laptop but the shape of a tablet. It's more capable than any other iPad, but it's still far less capable than any MacBook. It can be used with a keyboard or a stylus or neither. It's a tablet, you just might not use it like one. The iPad Pro sits so distinctively between the boundaries of tablet and laptop that it makes it a hard device to compare. Sure, it's probably fair to call it more tablet than laptop, but it's also... Apple's iPad mini is among the iOS devices getting a fresh update for 2015 today. Following on from the iPad Pro, ""the biggest news in iPad since iPad,"" the mini tablet's refresh is rather less revolutionary. The new iPad mini 4, says Apple, packs ""the power and performance of the iPad Air 2"" into a smaller mini enclosure, which now weighs just 0.65 pounds. That's a hair less than the Wi-Fi-only iPad mini 3's weight of 0.73 pounds. The iPad mini 4 will be priced from $399, replacing the mini... Apple always invites third-party developers to show off some of the most impressive new apps coming to its devices, but today it had something of a surprise guest: Microsoft. Apple brought Microsoft's Kirk Konigsbauer on stage to demonstrate how Office apps would work on the iPad Pro. For the most part, there's nothing unexpected here — Office for iPad is already a powerful and good looking suite of apps; now they're just optimized for the iPad Pro's larger screen. Office is also going to be... Apple took the wraps off a new $169 keyboard accessory for the newly announced iPad Pro today, integrating into a cover that's a little like the soft keyboards Microsoft has offered for its Surface tablets. The Smart Keyboard uses key domes that Apple first developed for the new MacBook announced earlier this year and connects to the iPad Pro using a new connector type — the Smart Connector — which means that it's not connecting over Bluetooth. The entire keyboard is cloth, which won't likely... Apple just announced the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro, its biggest iPad yet. It's a more powerful and more capable iPad than ever before, and it comes with something many thought Apple would never sell with an iOS device: a stylus. It's called the Apple Pencil, and it includes pressure sensitive technology and can be used simultaneously with a finger. Pressing lightly will produce a thin stroke, while firmer pressure can result in a heavier, darker stroke. That's similar to how Samsung's S Pen... Apple has unveiled its biggest iPad yet, the iPad Pro, and with it, a new chip: the A9X. The third-generation 64-bit processor offers double the memory bandwidth and storage performance of the old A8X, and Apple's Phil Schiller promises that the new chip offers ""desktop-class performance."" Apple tends to say this every year, but that's not to say the A9X isn't a substantial step up from the A8X. ""It is faster than 80 percent of the portable PCs that shipped in the last 12 months,"" says... You no longer have to be super rich to get a gold Apple Watch. Well, as long as you're okay with the color gold, and not the metal. Apple is introducing gold and rose gold finishes for the aluminum Apple Watch sport. They'll be available at the same price as all of the other Apple Watch Sport's, meaning they're $349 for the smaller model and $399 for the larger model. Both models are going on sale today. After months of rumors and speculation, the iPad Pro is here. Apple has unveiled its latest addition to the iPad tablet lineup during a special press event in San Francisco this morning. Like the rumors suggested, the iPad Pro is a larger version of the traditional iPad. Apple CEO Tim Cook says it's the ""biggest news in iPad since the iPad.” Apple today announced that watchOS 2, the major update for the Apple Watch initially revealed at WWDC earlier this year, would be available for download on September 16th. The introduction of watchOS 2 brings in a number of new features, such as native third-party apps, third-party complications on watch faces, and improvements in performance throughout the system. In addition to the availability of watchOS 2, Apple is also introducing new watchbands and finishes for the Apple Watch,... Apple is working with luxury brand Hermès to introduce a new Apple Watch collection, the Apple Watch Hermès. The collection includes a custom face that uses Hermès' ""traditional iconography"" and comes with a choice of three bands: the Single Tour, the Double Tour, and the Cuff. All three bands are made with brown leather, and they can be paired with both sizes of stainless steel Watch case. The collaborative watches will be available beginning October 5th, and they're not going to come cheap:... At today's big event, Apple took time to showcase new, native apps for the Apple Watch. New standouts include Facebook Messenger, which marks Facebook's first effort on Apple's smartwatch, and GoPro. With the latter app, you're able to use Apple Watch as a miniature viewfinder for your GoPro action camera. Another, medical-focused app called Airstrip demoed some of the new functionality made possible with native app development on Apple Watch. It provides doctors with a close look at patient... News is already breaking ahead of today's massive Apple event about the future of the Apple TV. According to The New York Times, the company has already inked a deal for what might be its first channel for original content.

For five years now, Apple has held a big event around September to announce the next iPhone — or, as in the past two years, the next iPhones. This year is no different.

A new study suggests there may be sex differences when it comes to pain — one that may open doors for better treatment.  Mice used in basic research are almost exclusively male Chronic pain affects more than 100 million people in the US, which is more than heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined.  And many pain conditions occur more often in women than in men, according to the FDA. That's why figuring out how male and female mice deal with pain — and whether they do so differently than humans — is so important. After all, most medical research — including pain research — starts with mice. In the study, researchers focused on microglia, a type of immune cell that can be found in the brain and the spinal cord. These cells are known to play a role in the ""volume knob"" for pain, explains Jeffrey Mogil, a pain researcher at McGill University and a co-author of the study. The knob turns way up after an injury. A genetic study done in Mogil's lab a few years ago had indicated that microglia weren't as important in the pain circuit of female mice. So, the scientists decided to find out if interfering with the microglia would have the same effect in male and female mice. Male mice had no pain, whereas female mice did The researchers used mice that were suffering from a hypersensitivity to pain. The scientists gave them drugs that target the microglial cells in the spinal cord, in the hopes that this would prevent the animals from feeling pain. But only male mice responded to the drugs — the female mice still had an increased sensitivity to pain. When the researchers repeated these experiments in mice under varying conditions, they saw the same results: male mice had no pain, whereas female mice did. ""Whatever the manipulation is, in every case, blocking microglia or some part of the microglial system brings the pain sensitivity back to normal in male mice, and doesn't do anything in female mice,"" Mogil says. In short, microglia don't seem to have anything to do with how female mice experience pain — even though the intensity of the pain is the same in both sexes. This means that there's another completely unknown biological culprit out there, Mogil says. ""And it's actually more clinically relevant than the one we've been studying, given that the majority of chronic pain patients are women and that we know nothing about it at all."" ""This is potentially a very important discovery which may go a long way to explain the marked differences in pain sensitivity and chronicity between women and men,"" says James McRoberts, a pain researcher at the University of California-Los Angeles who didn't take part in the study. McRoberts wants to see the study extended into other animals, such as rats, dogs, monkeys, and eventually humans — since, of course, mice are imperfect models. ""What is most striking is the magnitude of the differences."" ""What is most striking is the magnitude of the differences — they really are all-or-none,"" says Michael Caterina, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University who also didn't participate in the study. Yet, when one looks at the presence of the microglia in the spinal cord after injury, ""the anatomy doesn’t give anything away."" The work will probably provoke some significant discussion in the pain field, but also in neuroscience in general, he says. So what exactly do female mice use instead of microglia? Mogil and his team suspect that a different kind of immune cell, called a T cell, may be involved instead. To test this idea, the researchers removed T cells from female mice. They found that under those conditions, female mice adapt and use the male microglial pain system. But when the researchers gave them their T cells back, the female mice stopped using the microglia. Still, exactly how T cells are involved in the pain experienced by female mice is anybody's guess. Now that the researchers have identified this circuit, they will have to spend a lot more time figuring out how it works in female mice. Of course, eventually research on humans will have to take place as well. ""The default assumption of all of biomedical research is that the biology in mice and rats is similar to the biology in humans until proven otherwise,"" Mogil says. But until human studies are carried out, that's just speculation. While no pain medications on the market target microglia, basic science — like what Mogil is doing in mice — is what leads to new medicine. Male animals in general are used more often than female animals in medical research, despite the fact that men and women react differently to some drugs and are at risk for different diseases. This practice has a lot to do with the idea that hormonal changes in female mice introduce too much variability in results. Yet a number of studies — including one from Mogil's lab — have shown that this isn't the case. The NIH wants scientists to study more female animals and tissues ""In fact, if the people that had researched microglia 15 years ago had been using male and female mice, they would have noticed the difference right off the bat,"" Mogil says. But researchers ""spent all their time and all their efforts studying male rodents, exclusively."" And as Mogil’s study today shows, that limits our knowledge in a very real way. As researchers start using more female mice, scientists may find more differences of this nature. Still, Mogil says that he didn't expect to find such a drastic distinction between males and females. ""Here's a whole cell that is involved in this biological circuit in males and a completely different cell that's involved in the biological circuit in females,"" he exclaims. ""I could be wrong, but I don't know that anyone ever found that before — outside of reproduction, of course.""",0.3700922070411947,0.6299077929588053,0.6191901961685277,1007,4.8510427010923536,446,5.8991031390134525,0,0,"Science, Report"

In the short term, this decision means executions in the four states that use the drug will proceed as normal. It also deals a blow to the growing movement against the death penalty. Opponents argued that midazolam is an ineffective anesthetic The Eighth Amendment forbids the use of ""cruel and unusual punishments."" For many years, one way to avoid such punishments during an execution was by using lethal injection; the method is widely considered to cause less suffering than the electric chair, for instance. But in the case brought before the Supreme Court, three people on death row — Richard Glossip, John Grant, and Benjamin Cole — argued that midazolam, the first drug used in Oklahoma's three-drug cocktail, is an ineffective anesthetic. People who are given the drug experience the pain caused by the other two drugs in the injection, they say. Three high-profile ""botched"" executions involving midazolam in 2014 provided support for the case. In all three cases, the men appeared to regain consciousness during the procedure. There were also reports of them gasping and snorting for air, and moving around in pain. However, Justice Samuel Alito argues that petitioners haven't identified suitable alternatives to the drug or method of execution, especially since the two drugs that could be used as substitutes, thiopental and pentobarbital, aren't available in Oklahoma. Also, the decision states that District Court didn't commit a clear error in choosing midazolam as an effective anesthetic. The Court argued that petitioners failed to identify a suitable alternative Midazolam is a sedative; the FDA has yet to classify it as a stand-alone anesthetic because the regulatory agency isn't sure it works the way it should. However, some states started using it as an anesthetic when they ran out of traditional lethal injection drugs. The reason they ran out is fairly simple: pharmaceutical companies refused to sell them certain anesthetics because they didn't want to be associated with executions. This wasn't the first attempt at arguing such a case in the US. In 2008, in Baze v. Rees, the Court decided that Kentucky's lethal injection procedure was lawful because the state was using procedures that were similar to those used in other states. But a lot has changed since then. Finding the drugs needed for lethal injections has become increasingly difficult — so much so that Oklahoma and Utah passed laws that would allow them to use nitrogen gas and firing squads to carry out executions, respectively. However, it is worth noting that support for the death penalty is falling in the US. Recent figures from the Pew Research Center found that only 56 percent of respondents are currently in favor of the practice. And in his dissent of today's decision, Justice Stephen Breyer argues that the death penalty is inherently cruel and therefore can't be considered constitutional. It's likely that the Supreme Court will hear a case on the matter in the future.",0.7753256411032171,0.2246743588967829,0.7832787127310956,514,5.1867704280155644,291,6.2955326460481098,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World, Breaking"

Multiple outlets picked up the story, but in all the excitement, few stopped to ask two very simple questions: was this magical, microbe-detecting condom actually feasible? And, assuming it was, would making it available to the masses actually be a good idea? So — is it feasible? Not really. S.T.EYE, a concept dreamed up for the TeenTech Awards (effectively a UK-wide science fair), is more a pipe dream than a prototype — and one that doesn’t do much to factor in the existing science of STI detection. As outlined by Muaz Nawaz, 13; Daanyaal Ali, 14; and Chirag Shah, 14; students at the Isaac Newton Academy in East London, S.T.EYE would contain antibodies for a variety of STIs. If one of those STIs happened to be present in the genitals of a condom wearer or their partner, the antibodies would recognize the antigens and cause the condom to change color — a different one for each STI. To work as proposed, the S.T.EYE would have to make use of a rapid-acting test. At present, HIV is the only STI that has a rapid test on the market. And Oraquick — an at-home test that detects HIV antibodies in saliva — wouldn’t fit the model proposed by the S.T.EYE team: it takes 20 minutes to provide results. Perhaps the closest model to the S.T.EYE dream is the rapid strep test, which uses antibodies to detect antigens. But even that test takes several minutes to register results — not quite like the magical, instant diagnosis envisioned by much of the media. Add in the fact that you’d need something that could test for a wide range of STIs in one go — which no current test is able to do — and we’re clearly off in the realm of science fiction rather than science fact. Of course, the fact that the science isn’t there yet is not an indication that it never will be. So it’s still worth asking whether an STI-diagnosing condom is actually a good idea — and here, the answer is a bit more complex. Colin Adamo, the sex educator behind Hooking Up and Staying Hooked, is at least heartened to know that the young men behind S.T.EYE are thinking about sexual health. ""They recognized that sexually transmitted infections are a problem among their classmates, and their peers across the country, and they’re approaching that problem creatively. That’s great."" But while he applauds their intent, he sees issues with the execution. ""I think the fact that they created this as a solution is evident of the larger problems related to sexual health education and discourse"" in both the United States and the UK. The idea that it might be more desirable to learn about a STI diagnosis from a condom, rather than a conversation with your partner about sexual health and safer sex practices is troubling — and, what’s more, suggests we’re not providing young people with the skills needed to have these very important conversations. And if young people can’t talk about sexual health with their partners, what makes us think that those same young people (or any of us, really) have the emotional maturity to handle receiving the diagnosis of a highly stigmatized infection at an incredibly vulnerable moment? ""If you don’t possess the emotional intelligence or communication skills to have conversations about sexual health before a sexual encounter with a partner, and then all of the sudden you have this meter that tells you you are at risk of contracting a sexual infection from someone you are inside of, or just pulling out of, what does that mean in terms of what you do next?"" Adamo continues. Even though one in two people will contract an STI at some point in their life, these infections are still highly stigmatized — and it’s easy to envision in a scenario in which the reveal leads to shame, anger, and, potentially, violence. ""In a perfect world, where there was no stigma related to STIs… and the response would just be, ‘Oh, hey I should get treated for that,’ you could see how something like this could be a really interesting innovation,"" says Dr. Leslie Kantor, vice president of education for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. We don’t live in that world. ""We’re actually doing some work on the link between HIV and intimate partner violence — and, sad to say, but there are times when, as a result of a partner disclosing their HIV status, they are met with both verbal and sometimes physical violence,"" Kantor says. Even if that’s an extreme scenario, it seems rather likely that few couples would greet an unexpected STI diagnosis calmly. Add in the likelihood of false positives, and suddenly a couple winds up angry and ashamed over an STI that neither one of them has — and, given that they were using a condom, that they would have been unlikely to transmit to one another regardless. Which leads us to the truly ironic aspect of an STI-detecting condom: anyone using such a product consistently and correctly wouldn’t actually need the added tech that it provides. By and large, condoms — even just the boring, low-tech condoms we have today — are very, very good at preventing STI transmission. To the extent that STIs continue to be a problem among sexually active people, it’s not because condoms themselves are failing to protect us: it’s because many of us just aren’t using them. ""The big message we need to get to people is that the best kind of condom is one that makes you wear it,"" says Kantor. ""If somebody can do that, then we should definitely give them all the science prizes."" Adamo, on the other hand, thinks the answer we’re looking for is already in our hands. ""There are way easier solutions than a really high-tech, Star Trek condom,"" he says. If a better condom is all you’re looking for, you don’t have to wait years for something like S.T.EYE to actually hit the market. If and when high-tech condoms actually arrive, they’re likely to be significantly more expensive than your standard Trojan. Anyone who’s willing to spend more on condoms already has a wide range of more upscale options available. None of which is to say that we don’t need better tech to improve sexual health outcomes, or that would-be tech entrepreneurs should steer away from this topic. But for a better model than S.T.EYE, look to the apps recently released by Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood Direct — which launched this month in California — offers access to at-home (though not instant) STI testing; when paired with Planned Parenthood Care, users also get access to video visits with Planned Parenthood health care providers. While these programs address the same desire for discretion and privacy met by S.T.EYE, they also ensure that users get the care, consideration, and education associated with a clinic visit — as well as connecting them to appropriate treatment, should their test come back positive. Though the programs are still in pilot stages, they’ve shown great promise as options for individuals interested in accessing STI testing in a comfortable, private setting. Innovative new technology may one day dramatically change how we think about sexual health: it’s just far more likely to come from dedicated sexual health programs than a group of teenagers at a science fair.",0.6325950889388146,0.36740491106118545,0.15963167163664455,1254,4.8979266347687398,605,6.1570247933884295,0,0,"Science, Tech, Report"

It sounds far-fetched, but it's a technology that the US Department of Transport (DOT) is seriously investigating as a solution to drunk driving. Last week, it unveiled its latest research into two types of in-car alcohol sensors: the first is a breathalyzer housed in the steering wheel, and the second is an infrared sensor that scans the skin. Both technologies check if a driver's blood alcohol concentration is at or above 0.08 (the legal limit in all 50 states) and then lock down the car if the driver is too intoxicated to drive. The technology is being researched under the Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety program or DADSS. It's currently only in the research stage, but its backers — including car manufacturers such as BMW, Ford, and General Motors — say it could save thousands of lives every year. Although roads in the US are getting safer (driving related deaths fell by nearly a quarter in the last decade), the DOT notes that nearly 10,000 people are still killed every year by alcohol-impaired crashes. It estimates that in-car alcohol sensors could save 7,000 lives annually. ""A powerful new tool in the battle against drunk driving."" ""[This technology] has enormous potential to prevent drunk driving in specific populations such as teen drivers and commercial fleets,"" said Mark Rosekind, the administrator of the Department of Transport's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in a press statement. ""Making it an option available to vehicle owners would provide a powerful new tool in the battle against drunk driving deaths.""  Just because something is technologically feasible though, doesn't mean it will ever be widely adopted. Back in 2007, Nissan unveiled its own prototype car that detected a driver's blood alcohol using a sensor in the gear stick, but the technology never went beyond the concept stage. Similarly, although some DUI offenders are forced to install in-car breathalyzers before they're allowed back on the road (the technology is similar to DADSS' proposals but slower and more bulky), it's unlikely that the majority of drivers would voluntarily submit to the same checks as convicted criminals. However, as Rosekind notes, in-car breathalyzers could still find a place in the market if targeted at ""specific populations."" If the technology was approved at a federal level, for example, then worried parents might have it installed when their children learn to drive. Similarly, trucking companies might outfit their fleets with the sensors not only to save lives but also reduce insurance costs. Deaths caused by drunk driving are all ultimately preventable — and having the technology available seems better than no option at all.",0.2971437582483262,0.7028562417516738,0.5014664037457319,463,5.2505399568034559,285,6.1368421052631579,0,2,"Tech, Transportation, US & World"

Little did I know, however, that the most exciting thing I’d find in the city wouldn’t be at Computex at all. A few minutes’ walk to the east of the exhibition halls is the Gogoro Experience Center, a sparsely decorated store dedicated to showing off the upcoming Gogoro electric scooter. The first time I, and most of the rest of the world, heard about Gogoro was at CES this January. It was a triumphant debut for a company formed by a splinter group of former HTC designers and engineers that had been operating in stealth mode for four years. The Gogoro Smartscooter earned The Verge’s Best in Show award and was universally hailed for its ambitious, potentially revolutionary vision for fast battery swaps and independence from the dreaded long recharge times. As exciting as it was to read about those things, though, it wasn’t until I saw the Gogoro in person that I properly understood its appeal. Everything about this scooter has been thought out. Every design decision feels right. The roundedness of the Gogoro gives it a friendly appearance, but it also helps it accommodate a full-size helmet alongside the two batteries in the storage compartment under its seat. A Bluetooth dongle acts as the key to unlocking the scooter and there is, of course, a big ""GO"" button in the middle to get you up and running. All the little design touches, like the small winglets that pop out on the sides for a passenger to step on to, just add charm and humanity to the Gogoro. As I walked around the Experience Center, all I could think was that this is how I’d run a business of this kind. The store is stripped down to the essential basics, eschewing unnecessary decorations to put the scooter front and center. It’s young, hip, clean, and simple — just like the product it’s trying to sell. Potential customers can either mount the demo Gogoro units stationed around the Center or ask for a test ride out on the streets of Taipei. Gogoro’s Jason Gordon, one of the HTC alumni on the team, tells me that no one else offers this sort of personal touch when it comes to buying scooters. They’ve been a commoditized industry for a while — where innovation has been supplanted by iterative updates — and he sees a lot of potential for Gogoro to stand out with the friendliness of its service. That’s the thing about Gogoro, it’s about a lot more than just the scooter. The purchase of one of the company’s Smartscooters is just the beginning of a relationship. Starting with Taipei this summer, Gogoro will install battery-swapping stations all around the cities in which it operates, freeing you from the need to recharge anything yourself. And those stations are as cleverly designed as everything else from the company. The only way to take a battery out of them is to put your old one in, at which point the system selects the best battery — in terms of current charge and number of charging cycles it’s been through — and pops it out for you automatically. Each battery is then associated with your scooter’s serial number in Gogoro’s systems, meaning that if it’s ever stolen, the thief would be immediately identified the next time a recharge is needed. Gogoro is building up an impressive electronic infrastructure as well. The company runs diagnostics of both the scooter and the battery when the latter is plugged in, plus it also does periodic tests via an associated smartphone app. It’s the sort of Internet of Things project where you actually want the thing connected because it helps you — to find the nearest station with ready batteries, for example — instead of because it’s the hot new trend in tech. I’m also a fan of Gogoro’s plans for the batteries after they’ve served their useful number of charges. The company rates each battery to last for 2,000 recharge cycles, but expects to lose 20 percent of the original capacity after a quarter of that usage. So, after 500 cycles, Gogoro batteries are taken out of circulation — in order to ensure reliability for users, who are told to expect a 60-mile range from a pair of fully charged batteries. The discarded batteries will then be repurposed to help power data centers, home appliances, and offices. A good example is energy time-shifting: charging up the batteries at night, when the price of electricity is lower, and then using them to power something like a refrigerator during the day. Once that second life is over, Gogoro’s aim will be to give the batteries away to impoverished areas around the world where people have no easy access to electricity. It’s unusual for me to be so singularly enthusiastic about anything, but unlike most new technology products, the Gogoro doesn’t have many obvious weaknesses. Of course, its price could be prohibitive — whether for the buyers, who will have to pay a subscription fee for unlimited battery swaps, or for the company, which will need to spend lavishly to ensure its recharge station coverage is dense enough. And if Gogoro’s battery network lets you down, you don’t have the easy option of plugging the scooter in at home. But just this once, I’d prefer not to curb my enthusiasm. The Gogoro Smartscooter is a beautifully and thoughtfully designed piece of mobile technology. It has the potential to do for electric scooters what Tesla did for electric cars. And guess what, it rides like a dream too! I only got to try it briefly in the nearby parking lot, but it was enough to impress me with its instant torque and easy control. The Gogoro is the most interesting and exciting new thing we can look forward to in the near future, not least because — if all goes to plan — it could help shape the distant future as well.",0.6324790058342169,0.3675209941657831,0.5028619692223253,1030,4.7999999999999998,521,6.1209213051823417,0,58,"Tech, Transportation, Photo Essay, Report"

But the company has apparently been working in secret on a way to safely return the rockets we send to space. It's a bullet-shaped housing with wings called Adeline. Rockets are big, loud, impressive feats of technology. They're also wasteful, primarily because we still haven't figured out a way to reuse them. When the first stage of a rocket falls back to Earth, the inevitable impact leaves companies with only one option — pick up the pieces. We know that SpaceX is tantalizingly close to realizing its reusable Falcon 9, but there really aren't any other publicized solutions in the industry. That's where Adeline comes in. Airbus has been working on the idea since 2010, and it's much different that what Elon Musk has cooked up. Instead of using aerodynamic wings and retro-rockets to land on a platform (SpaceX's preferred method), Adeline will use wings and a set of propellers to safely return a rocket's engines and avionics. Adeline is more efficient than the reusable Falcon 9, but returns less  When the rocket's first stage completes the job of putting a payload into orbit, it will separate and begin its descent. Adeline will then detach and eventually coast to a safe runway landing, guided by its wings and ballistic shape, and slowed and stabilized by the propellers. It could then be serviced and attached to a new rocket, quickly ready to perform the same task. Airbus carefully caveats Adeline by saying it makes rockets ""semi-reusable,"" which is an important point. The rest of the rocket's first stage — namely, the fuel tank — will crash into the ocean as usual. SpaceX, on the other hand, plans to return all of the Falcon 9's first-stage equipment along with its massive fuel tank. The benefit of Airbus' system is that it won't require the extra fuel that SpaceX needs to return an entire rocket stage. Adeline could also be adapted to be used on any rocket, though Airbus says that it is currently only developing it to be used for the European Space Agency's Ariane 6. That rocket won't make its first launch until at least 2020.",0.3952392913413742,0.6047607086586257,0.7490917985522119,372,4.814516129032258,224,5.71875,1,0,"Science, Transportation"

Federighi announced, among other things, that CarPlay will begin allowing automakers to add apps into the system starting with the release of iOS 9 this fall. That means the system will be gaining a far tighter bond with the car in which it's running than it's had so far. An automaker's CarPlay app could, for instance, control the FM / AM radio or the climate control — functions that run very close to the car's hardware. At present, control of a car's most basic functions typically requires that a driver switch out of CarPlay and into the car's native user interface. For users, it's a jolting experience — if you're routing to a destination using Apple Maps and listening to music on iTunes (or, soon, Apple Music) but you want to up the cabin temperature one degree, you've got to bounce out to a system that looks completely different, then switch back into CarPlay when you're done. Theoretically, this new feature would prevent that kind of context-switching by turning all of a car's functionality into an app or two.  Apple and automakers are crafting an ever-growing Matryoshka doll In a way, Apple and automakers are crafting an ever-growing Matryoshka doll here: the car companies have largely sought to compartmentalize CarPlay and Android Auto by turning them into ""apps"" inside their own user experience — a user experience that has often lagged in quality and performance versus what Apple and Google have been able to make. Now, by opening up the platform to car apps, Apple is turning the tables by compartmentalizing the car itself. Who will win the battle? In the short term, the odds are in automakers' favor: Android Auto and CarPlay are still very difficult to find, and it wouldn't seem that they've become make-or-break features for prospective buyers in dealerships. (Though that'll likely change over time.) The GMs and Toyotas of the world — companies that are still dead-set on controlling the dashboard experience as much as they're able — aren't going to feel much pressure right now to make apps that eliminate the need to ever visit Chevy MyLink, or Cadillac Cue, or Toyota Entune. If that's not heel-digging, I don't know what is In fact, Toyota hasn't committed to any date for rolling out CarPlay or Android Auto — and it just announced that it's looking into deploying Ford's open-source connected car platform, SmartDeviceLink. If that's not heel-digging, I don't know what is. It'll be fascinating to see which automakers bite at this announcement, how hard, and how soon. It's likely to imagine that Hyundai would be near the top of the list of car companies buying into it, since they've already announced a CarPlay-compatible dashboard stripped of extra UI cruft launching next year. But Toyota — the world's biggest car company — isn't going to be anywhere near the leading edge on this. Correction: The article originally stated that context switching is also required for Android Auto, but Android Auto does have a UI tab that allows automakers to interact directly with the car.

It's an inflatable device meant to add to a spacecraft's atmospheric drag, and — after a week of weather delays — NASA is performing the second major test of it today at 1:30PM ET. NASA will begin the broadcast at 1PM, and it can be seen above. LDSD works in three stages.

Then, a separate rocket will propel the craft to 180,000 feet (about 55,000 meters) at more than 2,880 mph (4,635 km/h). It's at that point that the donut-shaped kevlar airbag that makes up the supersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator, or SIAD, will deploy. The SIAD decelerates the spacecraft to about 1,400 mph (2,253 km/h) when a massive parachute takes over, which slows the spacecraft to a safe speed for a water landing. It was the parachute that failed during last year's test — supersonic winds tore it to shreds. This time around, NASA says the LDSD team ""has been rewriting the book on high-speed parachute operations."" Numerous changes were made to the parachute’s construction and geometry, and its ability to withstand the forces of deceleration will be the main focus of this particular test.

This year has seen the HTC One set a new design benchmark for Android (and now Windows Phone) handsets, Samsung switching to using real metal in its phones, and Sony refining a design language built around tempered glass and aluminum. But the hot new story is sapphire. Apple has committed an entire factory in Arizona to the full-time production of the ultra tough and scratch-resistant material, and all signs point to it planning to use it in the display for at least one of its new iPhones. There's no need to wait for the next iPhone, however, to find out what difference using sapphire will make. Kyocera's Brigadier and Vertu's exclusive range of luxury phones already have sapphire displays, and here at IFA, Huawei has just introduced its new Ascend P7 Sapphire limited edition handset. I spent some time with the latter phone today trying to discern a difference between the reinforced glass typically adorning phone fronts and the even hardier sapphire stuff. Huawei has taken the guts and design of its original Ascend P7, launched in May, and rebuilt them with more expensive stuff on the outside. The rear of device is now made of a ""high-tech"" ceramic that's three times stronger than steel, scratch-resistant, and fast to dissipate heat. The entire front, including the 5-inch 1080p screen and the bezels surrounding it, is covered by a sapphire crystal display. The aluminum frame that wraps around the top and sides of the P7 is retained, though it's rose-colored in this limited edition handset. Overall, this is a phone that aims for a glamorous look and achieves it with ease. The patterned rear is extremely reflective and, at the right angle, can be used as an impromptu mirror. The aluminum glints in the light. Huawei has checked off all the boxes for an ostentatious phone. Alas, the front of the P7 Sapphire is almost as glossy as its rear. There's no difference to be found between regular glass and sapphire when considering screen reflectivity — both make the P7's brightness look inadequate under the harsh lights of the trade show floors. Similarly, I wasn't able to detect any meaningful difference in contrast, color saturation, or viewing angles when comparing the two displays. Whatever distinction may exist is too subtle to be picked up by the human eye. The big advantage of sapphire over glass has always been its extreme scratch resistance. I wasn't able to test that today, and I doubt it's something that too many people will readily notice. After all, the absence of a scratch where you'd otherwise get one with a glass screen is a pretty tough thing to appreciate. Handling the sapphire-fronted P7 also felt no different from the standard edition. Knowing that I was holding the more premium device did make it feel like a more exclusive experience, but not a tangibly better one. The one quirky difference I found was that, when both phones were laid face down, the P7 Sapphire slid around on the table more than the original P7 with a glass screen. So perhaps its surface has less friction to it, but again, that didn't translate to a difference that the end user will be able to sense. Huawei says it'll price the Ascend P7 Sapphire ""a little bit higher"" than the original and launch it in limited quantity in China. An event in Shanghai on September 12th will make all details known, though a global release will depend on the strength of demand. My conclusion after poking and prodding this sapphire display is one of ambivalence. From a user's perspective, it's indistinguishable from the glass screens already on the market, which is great if you value scratch resistance highly. But that switch isn't without its tradeoffs, with sapphire being both hard to produce and more susceptible to cracking. As HTC's former chief designer Scott Croyle once explained to me, the brittleness of ceramic is the reason why smartphone makers have been so reluctant to use it in the past. Maybe Huawei, Apple, Kyocera, and Vertu have figured out ways to minimize the downsides of using these more advanced materials and we can all look forward to tougher and more durable phones in the future. The thing about durability, though, is that it can't be tested in a day.

Until March of 2015, a small group will continue to support the Little Printer, after which they'll try to sell it or release the code as an open source project.

The ""internet of things"" had also gained traction over the preceding few years, and BERG moved away from its original design consulting work to start making its own connected products, something Webb now says it's ""not reached a sustainable business in."" Before this shift, Webb also produced a comic with author Warren Ellis (who named the studio), including a special device that let readers scour the pages for clues added in invisible ink. Ellis published a short retrospective on the studio today. ""It feels like a significant moment,"" he wrote, ""as significant, I think, as their turn into internet-of-things products and services, which had its own sadness for a lot of people."" There's no word on what the team behind BERG will be doing next, and keeping the Little Printer alive as a commercial product seems dubious. Smart homes, connected devices, and the internet of things seem perpetually on the verge of becoming practical and ubiquitous, without ever quite making the final leap.

But it turns out that with spray paint, LEDs, and a 3D printer, you can make a functional and surprisingly convincing version of one of the designs. Adafruit has a step-by-step guide to making the helmet, which of course it also sells parts for, but the basic process is shown above: you download the design file, resize the helmet to fit your head, and print it out using tinted transparent plastic, a process that took Adafruit three days and over a pound of filament to complete. Then you cover the face plate with tape and spray the rest with metallic paint. Then attach strips of LEDs to micro-controllers that you can program with light patterns, slide them inside, and become a robot. Making the helmet requires some tinkering and special equipment — you'll need to be able to solder wires, and the helmet above is supposed to be about 9 inches long and wide and 10 inches high, which is significantly bigger than many hobbyist 3D printers can manage. But getting access to a large printer is a lot easier (and cheaper) than figuring out how to cast plastic or shape metal and glass.

But preceding them on the announcement calendar was the similarly metal-rimmed Galaxy Alpha, which until today looked like a promising alternative to the Galaxy S5. Now that I’ve held it in my hands, I can say it’s so much more than that. The Galaxy Alpha is terrifically thin and light, though that’s not the first thing you’ll notice about it. It happens to be damn good looking too. The sheen from those polished edges makes all the difference, combining with the lustrous Super AMOLED display to make a great first impression. Some devices look better in press photos than reality — the LG G Watch R is a recent example — but the Galaxy Alpha is exactly the opposite. You have to see it in person to appreciate its slick and refined look. Everything is appropriately proportioned, the 4.7-inch screen size feels just right, and ease of one-handed use is as good as you’ll get from any device in that size class. Those who might have felt let down by the new Moto X moving to a larger 5.2-inch screen may find solace in Samsung’s more compact Alpha. Ergonomically, this phone is a delight. I don’t want to call it perfect, but it kind of is. Like the iPhone 5S, the Galaxy Alpha feels almost lighter than it should be. Scale up the iPhone’s height and width to the size of a 4.7-inch display and you’d have a device very similar to the Alpha. The chamfered metal edging is the same — good looking but also prone to scratching — and so is the comfortable fit in the hand. Samsung’s handset seems to be anticipating the rumored 4.7-inch iPhone coming next week, and doing so in the best fashion possible. The Korean company has produced a phone that’s attractive to the touch and to the eye, raising its game in time to fend off Apple’s latest assault. Whatever new iPhone emerges from Cupertino on Tuesday will have to assert itself through more than just good looks and a fine feel in the hand. I'm not ready to crown the Galaxy Alpha as Samsung's best overall phone — for one, the size of its 1,860mAh battery worries me — but judged purely on its design and the desire it's produced in me to have it, this phone is a winner. It even manages to retain some of Samsung's familiar personality with its patterned surfaces and dimpled back. When paired with the iffy plastic of the past, they felt like the hallmarks of design failure, but here they add to the idiosyncratic appeal of the device.

At a basic level, making a round smartwatch with practically no bezel at all is hard — it’s a message I got time and time again as I toured Motorola’s Chicago headquarters this week.  “We’ve done round before,” says Iqbal Arshad, the senior vice president responsible for Motorola’s entire engineering operation. He gestures to a Motorola Aura at his side, a beautiful and unusual $2,000 novelty that the company briefly sold in the late aughts. Arshad still looks proud of it half a decade later, and he should be: it was the first phone (and possibly the first consumer device) with a high-resolution circular display, long before the Nest thermostat started taking homes by storm. “But the challenge was how to make a round product without having all the circuitry — for example, in Aura, that you see at the bottom of the device.” Early Motorola smartwatch concepts used square displays. As Arshad talks, showing off an exploded 360 that’s been splayed into its individual layers of chips, glass, and metal, I realize that this is his art. He talks about the half dollar-sized circuit board with the same energy and nuance that an architect might use to describe an evocative structure — or like Arshad’s counterpart, Jim Wicks, might gush over a book of leather swatches. He describes how eliminating the bezel required herculean engineering, moving all connections between components to the Z-axis — vertically through the device, that is, instead of extending beyond the edges of the circuit board — and turning the stainless steel case itself into an antenna. Motorola says that all of this effort went into making the Moto 360 round — or nearly round, anyway — because the shape of time is inexorably ingrained into our minds from an early age. Time is round. Design director Dickon Isaacs notes that when you draw a house, you instinctually draw a box with a triangle on top; when you draw a watch, you draw a circle with a strap on either side. ""How do we create something that is not just a piece of technology on your wrist? This is where the whole idea of having a round device on your wrist came from. It’s the notion of time, and time is associated with something round,"" Arshad explains. When you draw a watch, you draw a circle with a strap on either side And yet for all the emphasis on time and its physical manifestation, the software that runs on this watch nearly didn’t show it at all. ""I think in some of our early conversations we were even quite provocative and said ‘Maybe the watch shouldn’t even tell the time,’"" says David Singleton, director of engineering for Android Wear at Google. Brett Lider, Wear’s user experience lead, chimes in. ""Which people laugh at because it seems so ridiculous that a watch wouldn’t tell you the time, but really I don’t need to know that it’s 10:00. I need to know that I need to be in a meeting in two minutes if it’s about to be 10:00. Like, the time really doesn’t matter."" ""That idea of not putting the time there, it lasted a long time,"" Singleton says. To his credit, there’s a sexiness to the notion that the actual numerical time of day doesn’t matter, as long as your phone knows quite literally everything about your schedule — but sooner or later, Google’s team says that reality set in as the Wear platform took shape. ""Obviously we decided to come up with something that allows you to answer the question, ‘What time is it?’ as well as know when your next important commitment is."" That’s good, because a round object on the wrist that couldn’t tell the time would be odd, to say the least. David Singleton and Brett Lider of Google's Android Wear team play with the Moto 360. The 360 wasn’t always round, though. As we walked through the company’s rapid prototyping facility — the humming, machine-filled room tasked with pumping out physical copies of designs to see if they’re any good — Isaacs shows off a handful of early squares and squircles that didn’t make the cut. There’s the whole philosophy about time being round, of course, but there’s the more pragmatic matter of square watches not resting as naturally on the wrist as a round one does. Once they settled on the circle, the team debated making the bezel fat enough to fit the ambient light sensor, but a thinner bezel with a blacked-out chunk missing from the bottom of the display ultimately won out. The 360 could've been a square or a squircle And in our interviews with the Google team, the gravitation toward round as the natural shape for Android Wear was just as apparent. ""It happens to be that round objects just sit on the wrist better. If you actually look at the bones in the wrist, there’s a knobby bone here that for some people is uncomfortable to wear something that isn’t round,"" Lider says. He mentions the ""fuse"" user interface elements on Wear, the graphical countdowns for cancelable actions that can be found in some screens. ""We thought of wrapping that fuse around the edge of the display, and that was something that we were really excited about from the beginning,"" he says. ""It just feels very different and compelling than your traditional linear bar on a traditional UI."" Motorola experimented with a thicker bezel before settling on a thin one with a blacked-out area on the display. Matias Duarte, Google’s colorful vice president of design, admits his preference for the Motorola as Android Wear came together. ""The 360, as you know, has been coming later in the release cycle of this first generation of Android Wear. But throughout the whole cycle, it was the one that you’d see so many people in our development team using,"" he says. ""Even when people are like, ‘How are you carrying it around? This week’s build you only get two hours battery life!’ And I’m like, ‘I know, but I like to wear it.’"" None of this matters if Motorola can’t thrive under Lenovo’s upcoming ownership and sell phones and wearables by the millions. Wicks says he’s excited about the transition, pointing to Lenovo’s love for hardware — a passion he clearly shares — and says he’s here to make things actual humans want to buy. ""At a certain point, it’s like, what the hell? I’m not here to design for me, I’m here to design for you. And the tools that are available to us now as designers and as a company are allowing us to do these things — why would we not do that for people?"" None of this matters if Motorola can’t thrive under Lenovo’s upcoming ownership Toward the end of the day, I walk by Dickon Isaacs, who offers everyone a heartfelt high-five as they pass through a laboratory doorway like athletes getting pumped to take the field. Win or lose, there’s a palpable sense that this is a company that believes in itself again. ""If you look at successful companies and brands, and you look at what they produce, you’ll see what they’re making kinda seems very much like what their brand stands for, and the way the people and their company operate, right?"" Wicks asks. ""To me, that’s the fun, that’s the inspiring part. That’s what allows you to get over crappy things that happen, the tough things.""

The company has found particular success in image sensors, where it now owns a reported 40 percent of the market and powers the cameras in devices like the iPhone 6 and Galaxy S6.  It’s not quite the consumer-focused innovation that made millions fall in love with Sony throughout the ‘80s and ’90s. But, in an extensive Wall Street Journal story published late last night, CEO Kaz Hirai made the case that this pivot is just as compelling as the company’s glory days. “Whether it’s a device that goes into other manufacturers’ products or sometimes our own, if there’s innovation there... that’s something I get excited about,” he says. The WSJ goes onto state that Sony has “stopped trying to replicate its glorious past as a creator of era-defining consumer-electronics gadgets” in favor of pursuing image sensors as a major concern alongside video games and entertainment. It’s not just Sony: Japanese companies like NEC, Toshiba, and Panasonic are increasing their focus on enterprise rather than consumers. And it’s not just Japan, either: European brands like Nokia, Siemens, and Philips have all wound down consumer operations to varying extents. If you’re not based in South Korea or Silicon Valley, it’s hard to make an impact with your own devices these days. Sony’s success with image sensors is a victory for innovation, but on a much smaller scale than the PlayStation or Walkman. Yes, the company has a technical edge on its competitors at the moment. But components are commodities, and supplying others puts Sony in a far more vulnerable position than when it won customers with its own designs and brand. While Sony now provides the muscle behind the most popular camera in the world, there’d be little stopping Apple from switching parts for price or performance reasons. Sony is set to report its year-end earnings tomorrow; expectations are that it’ll turn a moderate operating profit but record a net loss due to smartphone business write-downs. The real thing to look out for is whether the company gives any hints as to how it plans to handle its wildly disparate divisions. Sony offloaded VAIO last year —could Bravia or Xperia be next? ""Some flights are experiencing an issue with a software application on pilot iPads,"" American Airlines spokesperson Andrea Huguely later told The Verge. ""In some cases, the flight has had to return to the gate to access a Wi-Fi connection to fix the issue.

Although Sony predicts a 3.8 percent drop in revenue over the next year, it expects to make ¥320 billion in operating profit and ¥140 billion in net profit. But it’s worth looking at where that money will come from. Sony is expecting its Devices division, which includes its successful image sensor unit that produces components for the iPhone and other products, to bring in 16.5 percent more revenue and achieve a 36 percent higher operating profit. The profitable movie business, too, is expected to perform better over the next year. Gaming will be more or less flat as the PlayStation 3 generation winds down and the PS4 accelerates.

It was by far the company's biggest black mark in fiscal 2014, making an operating loss of 217.6 billion yen following a ¥176 billion ($1.47 billion) impairment charge from the smartphone and tablet business, and restructuring costs from the sale of the VAIO PC unit.

Sony is predicting slipping revenues and falling profits in its camera and home entertainment/audio divisions, but you can make the case for keeping both around; the critically acclaimed Alpha and RX cameras have clear synergy with the market-leading image sensor business, and lines like Walkman and Bravia are important to Sony’s identity and brand.

During a recent lunch he fidgeted in his chair, stood up, stretched, then took a seat, and resumed eating. ""We have an open office. I stand all day, I never sit,"" he explains. ""This feels uncomfortable."" Lore has been very busy of late building Jet, an ambitious e-commerce startup trying to take the shopping club model pioneered by Costco and reimagine it for an online world. Today the company is launching in private beta to its first 10,000 customers, a slice of the 360,000 people who signed up for early access. The goal is to offer better prices than even the largest web retailer, Amazon. That’s an ambitious battle to fight, and for Lore, it’s also personal. Round two against Amazon Lore built his prior company, Quidsi, into a leading online retailer across verticals like Diapers.com and Soap.com. In response, Amazon initiated a price war, cutting prices to the point where it was taking a loss on every box of diapers it sold. When the buyout offer came, Lore’s investors encouraged him to surrender. He accepted a $545 million acquisition and spent two years working for Jeff Bezos. I ask him if he felt like the sale was something he wanted, or something he did under duress. ""A little bit of both,"" he says with a wry grimace. The defeat was painful, but that experience also gave Lore an idea for a new kind of e-commerce company. ""The stuff you see today in e-commerce is all about how to get it to you faster. Same day, same hour! That’s very expensive."" The plan for Jet is to focus on cost, not convenience. Consumers pay $50 a year for a membership, and in return they get access to products at prices that Lore claims could save the average shopper $200 a year. ""Price is the big opportunity, nobody has been figuring out how to innovate around that."" Innovating around price, not service So how does Jet innovate around price? The first answer is the subscription model. Prime members are paying for goodies like speedy delivery and digital media. Jet makes all its money on the subscription and sells its goods at cost. ""It’s 6 to 8 percent cheaper right away because there is no profit on the sale,"" says Lore. If you routinely order the same product, say a refill on your water filters, you can choose to make them non-returnable, and save there. If you opt not to use a credit card, Jet passes on the savings from cutting out the interchange fee. The second and more interesting aspect of Jet is its ""Smart Cart"" system. ""In an offline world, the way to pull costs out of the system is have fewer products, make them bigger, leave them on the pallets,"" Lore says, referencing the model used by Costco and Sam’s Club. ""Online, you don’t limit the assortment, you steer people toward lower shipping and fulfillment costs."" As you shop, Jet suggests additional items you can purchase that will add to your savings. This process requires some algorithmic savvy, and Jet adds a little gamification as well, awarding users badges as they tally up discounts. Can you create an online only Costco? I played with Jet for a few days. While it's still in beta, I found prices much lower than Amazon, where I am a Prime member and frequent shopper. A toaster oven I just bought on Amazon was 25 percent less on Jet. I added it to my cart and searched for the diapers I order monthly for my kids. It offered me some Smart Cart options where I could reap savings on shipping. Overall the two items would have notched me a 30 percent savings over my recent Amazon bill.   Of course, to make all this work, you need massive scale. Many things I tried to price compare with Amazon just weren't on Jet yet. Which is why Lore has raised a whopping $220 million in funding before even launching to the public. The mountain of venture capital created a lot of chatter about another tech bubble, but Lore argues Jet stands in opposition to the current trend in e-commerce. ""Prime, ok what’s next. Drone delivery, ok what’s next."" He's skeptical of the wave of startups offering to shop for your groceries or deliver your meals. ""The early adopters are pushing people for higher and higher levels of service. These people have a lot of disposable income. But that market is relatively small in the context of US retail."" He saw this firsthand with Quidsi. ""Startups can move faster than ever. You can get to some big numbers quick. But then you’re saturated,"" says Lore. ""We had a 50 percent share of the diaper market in New York City and 60 percent share in San Francisco. Where do we go from there?

But it's not all great news for the Korean company: while Apple's high volume is matched by a consistently high average selling price, the growth for Samsung has come from its less profitable mid-range and low-end devices like the Galaxy A, E, and J series. With an estimated 83 million smartphones shipped in Q1 2015, Samsung owns a comfortable lead in terms of volume, however it's still got some catching up to do to match its 89 million shipments from a year earlier. Samsung anticipates a more profitable second quarter of the year thanks to its newly introduced Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge flagship devices. Both phones mark a significant upgrade for Samsung's premier smartphone line and look poised to deliver on the company's promise. In total, Samsung reported earnings of 47 trillion won (roughly $44 billion) for the quarter ending March 31st, resulting in an operating profit of 6 trillion won ($5.6 billion).

The rising influence of the world’s most populous nation has been described as the only geopolitical constant of the past 30 years, and recent times have seen it growing in economic influence as well. China is now the world’s largest smartphone market and continues surging forward as its economy and people ramp up their consumption of things to match their already vast production. China’s Lenovo now owns two of the United States’ (and, by extension, the world’s) best-known technology brands: ThinkPad and Motorola. Like the successful companies that have risen out of the neighboring Taiwan and South Korea, Chinese tech companies are gradually moving from simply producing devices to controlling and selling them under their own brands. That’s how Asus, HTC, Samsung, and LG all rose to prominence: following Western blueprints and capitalizing on already having the means of production for advanced technological devices. The difference now, though, is that China is a leader in tech consumption, not merely production. Being amazingly successful in a smaller country like South Korea can surely be lucrative, but Samsung products had to go global for the company’s success to be globally significant. Xiaomi, Huawei, and Lenovo’s own-brand smartphones, on the other hand, collect almost all of their sales in their native China. And they are the three companies tussling for third place behind Apple and Samsung in the global smartphone sales rankings. ""Success in China almost guarantees a place in the top 10 global market share stakes,"" explains mobile industry analyst Ben Wood of CCS Insight. ""That comes with associated benefits. Scale equals a strong position in the supply chain, component procurement, and more cost-effective manufacturing."" He cautions that popularity in China is no guarantee of global success — citing Huawei’s extensive and so far unsuccessful investment into establishing itself as a global brand — but that might not actually matter. HTC and LG are global brands, but their sales are being eclipsed by the relatively obscure Xiaomi. Four years ago, Nokia believed the key to its healthy survival as a mobile manufacturer was gaining a foothold in the crucial US market. It was taken as a given that to succeed in such a hyper-competitive industry, a company had to establish itself in the most important market — but is that still the United States? Today we are seeing companies thriving without any significant US presence. Xiaomi has no plans to test US waters, but it has growing revenues and a vibrant user base. It also has the lead in Chinese smartphone volume sales, eclipsing the mighty iPhone and Galaxy smartphones.   We're still #1! Xiaomi sold 14.2M phones in China Q1 2015 according to @IHS,beating Apple & Samsung. THANK U MI FANS! pic.twitter.com/MqnjSl3iNq The recognition of China’s importance is evident everywhere in the mobile industry. HTC is, for the first time, introducing two flagship smartphones this year, with the One M9+ being tailored to the needs and preferences of the Chinese market. In February, around the turn of the Chinese New Year, Lenovo brought Motorola back to China, setting it up as a sort of exotic alternative to local offerings, one where user customization is paramount. But no one has benefited from China’s growing appetite for smartphones more than Apple. Even as the developed world was becoming saturated with iPhones, Apple kept expanding its sales with the help of China. The iPhone first became available in China in 2009, relatively early in its now gloried history, and has kept growing in line with the country’s expansion in disposable income and smartphone demand. This past quarter, Apple sold more iPhones in China than in the United States, belying prognostications that the Chinese market wouldn’t be receptive to such a premium, high-margin device. Ben Evans of Andreessen Horowitz explains this phenomenon succinctly: it’s all down to income inequality. Even while the country suffers from widespread rural poverty and the most common phone purchases are of devices with negligible profit margins, ""there are, say, 100 million people in China who can buy luxury goods, and they want the best."" And, according to a recent survey of Chinese millionaires, the best when it comes to making luxury purchases and gifts is Apple. Ahead of Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Cartier, and Bvlgari. Interestingly, Samsung also makes it into the top 10 rankings in that survey, which suggests a close association in the Chinese consumer’s mind between advanced technology and luxury. The Apple Watch Edition is a product that sits at precisely this intersection of electronics and opulence. ""That's why the 5C flopped in China"" after doing just fine in the USA, continues Evans. Apple’s appeal is about status first and specifications second. Still, the Cupertino company unlocked a great deal of untapped Chinese demand when it introduced larger iPhones late last year, leading to the most profitable quarter in corporate history. ""For a range of reasons, the Chinese like big phones,"" says Evans, and ""when Apple offered one, they switched away from Samsung."" The phablet-sized iPhone 6 Plus might not exist were it not for China’s predilection for bigger screens. The One M9+ certainly wouldn’t. Only Japan, by virtue of its insularity and specific requirements for things like waterproofing, and the US could previously command such tailored solutions to their customers’ whims. But just as China has surpassed Japan to become the world’s second biggest economy, so have the preferences of its consumers risen in global importance. Apple still hasn’t made a waterproof iPhone for the Japanese, but it’s shown itself highly responsive to Chinese needs. The difference is scale. Mobile analyst Avi Greengart summarizes the demands of the Chinese consumer as follows: ""Chinese consumers prize status, absolute value, and local content."" Because Apple already has the luxury status, it can afford to sell its devices at a premium that other smartphone brands can only dream of commanding. When Apple presented greater value with its literally greater iPhones, China responded enthusiastically and bought even more. The local content aspect is Apple’s greatest weakness so far, and it’s where the local manufacturers continue to hold an advantage. Though that’s apparently not big enough of a hurdle to prevent record iPhone sales. The recent trend in the smartphone market has been a polarization between the two premium global leaders — Apple and Samsung, who can sell high-end devices at a healthy profit — and the litany of smaller manufacturers engaged in a price war that sees them barely scraping by. Just take a look at HTC’s operating margin for the past three quarters: it’s gone from 0.4 percent, to 0.3, to 0.05 percent. The middle class of smartphone manufacturers like HTC is being squeezed out of existence by the big guys at the top and the geographically limited Chinese companies that have smaller costs and cheaper manufacturing. And it’s all down to China’s scale. It amplifies everything happening within the country’s economy to the point where it affects the entire world. China wants its phones to either represent high status or great value for money, so that’s what we’ve got: the premium iPhone 6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, on the one hand, and the spec-laden Xiaomi Mi Note and OnePlus One, on the other. China isn’t the absolute kingmaker of the mobile world just yet, but its influence is already enormous, with many believing it to be of preeminent importance. ""There is no doubt China is the most important market to be successful in, way more so than the US,"" says Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. ""Smartphone growth is now coming from emerging countries. That's the new battleground with China and India playing a key role."" The growth of those economies has sprung up a fundamentally new and different mobile industry, where established global leaders like HTC, LG, Sony, and Microsoft’s mobile division struggle to find their proper place. Apple, on the other hand, has taken a comfortable seat at the top of the heap and is weathering this disruption in luxurious style.",0.8394148882930385,0.16058511170696155,0.8406367399946308,1345,5.2416356877323418,678,6.609144542772861,0,0,"Apple, Business, Mobile, Tech, US & World, Report"

One of our big themes at The Verge is that the pace of change is accelerating. Companies rise, industries are overturned, the climate warms, and it all happens faster than before. Culturally, few shifts in public opinion have been as radical as opinions about same-sex marriage over the past 25 years.

It is a story of states racing to ban same-sex marriage in their very constitutions, and of the movement for marriage equality somehow growing more powerful with every state that succeeded.

It stretches to the people who met in secret, under threat of arrest, just to discuss their own desires. It stretches to the police raids at New York’s Stonewall Inn, and to the brave men and women who fought back against the police.

The new agreement, brought into effect after months of deliberation, also introduces the EU's first net neutrality rules. As part of the agreement, companies across the EU are not allowed to block or throttle online content, applications, or services — rules that the Union says will ensure every European has access to the open internet, and that all traffic is treated fairly. The EU's parliament had originally pushed for the ban on roaming charges to come into effect in 2016, but the union's member countries wanted a later implementation. In the end the two sides compromised, with the June 2017 deal hammered out under Latvia's EU council presidency, shortly before the country hands control to Luxembourg in July. The agreement means that EU citizens using their phone in another member country will only have to pay the same rate for calls, text messages, and data usage as they would back home. EU citizens in another member country will pay the same for data as at home The elimination of roaming charges is a natural progression for the EU, in which the prices operators can charge have been slowly dropping since rules were applied in 2007. Prior to the new agreement kicking in, charges will drop once again — in April 2016, operators will only be able to charge an extra €0.05 ($0.06) per minute of call made, €0.02 ($0.02) per text message sent, and €0.05 per MB of data, excluding tax. But while the EU's council, commission, and parliament were able to reach a definitive decision on roaming charges, the body's new net neutrality rules are less concrete. While the agreement, which comes into effect in April 2016, says that all traffic will be treated equally, it still allows for providers to put aside portions of their networks to ""enable the provision of specialized or innovative services,"" of ""a higher quality."" The EU denies that it's promoting a two-tier internet service, but compared to more sweeping provisions made by the United States, European citizens have to deal with some caveats to their free and open internet. The net neutrality rules are less stringent than in the US EU representatives fought over the provisions of prospective net neutrality rules. The body's council, made up of the heads of the member countries, preferred to allow companies to set their own restrictions, while parliament pushed for a totally open system. The EU says the final agreement is the strongest in the world, but it does not specify exactly what is to be done when a service provider flouts the new rules, stating instead that it will oblige member states to set ""effective, proportionate and dissuasive"" punishments. While the FCC has already enforced the stringent net neutrality guidelines it introduced earlier this year, the wording of the EU's new agreement could leave room for internet providers to dodge true net neutrality, offering ""specialized"" and ""higher quality"" services to the highest bidders.",0.4368047972740515,0.5631952027259485,0.8792544042245964,511,5.0508806262230923,275,5.9927272727272731,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World"

Nasdaq is simply closing early to avoid the leap second Fortunately, most companies have factored the leap second into their operations this time around. Google has adopted a ""leap smear"" technique to avoid issues with the added second: rather than repeating it at the end of the day, Google's engineers will dice it into millisecond chunks and sprinkle it throughout the regular day, hopefully avoiding server meltdowns in the process. Bloomberg reports that the same process will be used by Japanese, Australian, South Korean, and Singaporean stock and futures exchanges. For others, the solution is less neat. In New York, where the leap second is scheduled to be added at around 8PM, stock markets are simply closing early to avoid headaches. Nasdaq will stop trading at 7:48PM, and shut down at 7:55PM, while both Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and CME Group are delaying data transitions during the period. In an environment where market values fluctuate and deals are done in tiny fractions of time, a rogue second could potentially affect millions of dollars, but for most internet users, the leap second should be added without too much of a hitch — Geoff Chester, of the US Naval Observatory in Washington, told Bloomberg that only ten percent of large-scale computer networks are set to suffer problems caused by the leap second. For now at least, companies need to learn how to factor the leap second into their operations, but that may change: members of the International Telecommunication Union meet every three years to decide whether to keep adding the extra time. If they decide not to, the Earth's rotation — slowed in varying degrees by weather, tectonic forces, and the pull of the Moon — will eventually fall out of synchronization with our clocks.",0.5057377084892449,0.49426229151075507,0.9342928712441155,405,5.0246913580246915,253,6.0671936758893281,0,0,US & World

Google, sending the long-running case back to a lower court where Google will have to argue that it made fair use of Oracle's copyrighted APIs. This has been a closely watched case, as the final decision could have a major impact on software development; a ruling in favor of Oracle, the Electronic Frontier Foundation says, could give certain tech firms ""unprecedented and dangerous power"" over developers by making it substantially more difficult for upstarts to create new software. That'll be the case unless fair use laws turn out to protect the use of APIs. The case centers on the code behind Android. Google built Android on top of a modified version of Java, the programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in the ‘90s. To help spur the development of apps for its new platform, Google used Java's pre-existing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), which many programmers were already comfortable using. Fight over Android is all about the future of APIs APIs are key to modern software development — they are bits of code that allow programs to communicate with each other. APIs are widely used today to allow third-party programs and services to build and expand on existing services. For example, third-party Twitter apps like Tweetbot use Twitter's APIs to pull in data from the social network. Many argue that the open use of APIs is central to the competition and innovation that has driven the software industry for years. Oracle sued Google in 2010. The software giant argued that Google had infringed on its copyrights by using Java's APIs without permission. In defense, Google said that APIs can't be copyrighted. The principle, says Google, its that ""open and interoperable computer languages form an essential basis for software development"" and are key to ""collaboration and innovation."" A district court ruled in Google's favor back in 2012, calling the API ""a utilitarian and functional set of symbols"" that couldn't be tied up by copyrights. Last May, a federal appeals court overturned that ruling by calling the Java API copyrightable. However, the court said that Google could still have lawfully used the APIs under fair use, sending the case back to a lower court to argue the issue. That's where Google will have to go next, now that the Supreme Court has declined to hear the issue over copyright itself.",0.3806847639571984,0.6193152360428016,0.14652020574200678,400,5.0625,229,6.1353711790393017,0,0,"Apps, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World"

We run a news organization, but we're also people — an increasingly diverse group of people that cares deeply about tolerance, inclusivity, and respect. The Verge basically ground to a halt yesterday morning That ever-deepening sense of care for one another is perhaps the best consequence of our accelerating culture. We are all more connected now, all more aware of how our individual decisions impact and intersect with the decisions of everyone around us in an endlessly expanding network diagram. The incredible speed at which gay marriage went from a laughable idea to an evil banned across the country to something our citizens overwhelmingly support is testament to that network. Communication changes culture in surprising ways. I like to remind our staff that The Verge peddles hope — that the promises about the future we make on these pages often come true. Sometimes, like yesterday, those promises come true in spectacular fashion. So I asked the staff for their reactions to this week's ruling, and we've collected them below. Nilay PatelEditor-in-chief, The Verge If you were born after 1990, it’s easy to feel like the entire marriage equality movement has happened in your lifetime. In 1991, Hawaii’s Supreme Court found the state’s refusal to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples to be discriminatory, launching the wave of legislation and lawsuits that culminated in the US Supreme Court’s affirmation of marriage equality yesterday. Yesterday belongs to the brave queer people who came together But 40 years before Hawaii came to its senses, small groups of queer men and women around the country were meeting in secret, under threat of arrest, to discuss their political situation. The Mattachine Society formed in 1950 in Los Angeles with a goal of bringing gay men together to offer emotional support and education about gay culture. The Daughters of Bilitis, founded in 1955 in San Francisco, brought lesbians together and worked to educate one another and the public about female homosexuality. The road to marriage equality was built by heroes all around the world, and I’m grateful for them all. But for me anyway, yesterday belonged to the brave queer people who came together in the face of near-universal scorn and disgust to begin building an atmosphere of mutual tolerance, acceptance, and love. The equality we will now enjoy forever began with their courage.  I called my partner just before the Supreme Court's ruling was announced. I told her it was going to happen any minute now; our lives were likely about to change. Seconds later, we saw the news. On the phone with her, I cried. We both gained a right yesterday; our love is now on equal footing with everyone else's. That said, the fight isn’t over. It is still incredibly difficult to be a transgender human in this country — especially if that human is a person of color. This was the freakin' tip-off People who are transgender face immense economical, political, legal, and social challenges. One in four trans people will lose a job because of who they are. One in five trans people will experience homelessness at some point in their lives. And while they have access to shelters, many are mistreated and misgendered by staff and fellow residents, alike. Health care for trans folk is improving, but only marginally so; many insurers continue to refuse to pay for transition-related care. And transgender individuals who are incarcerated or held in immigration centers have it bad: many trans folk who are incarcerated end up spending months in solitary confinement. This country is changing rapidly, and I can't express how much that means to me. I feel lucky every day that I get to call this place home. But I can't celebrate this ruling without wishing that America were better still. President Obama said yesterday that this country was now ""a little more perfect."" It's a nice sentiment — but it feels wrong. The fight isn't over. The LGBTQ community and its allies need to step up their game. This week's ruling wasn't a three-pointer in the final quarter. This was the freakin' tip-off. It didn't really sink in for me until I got a call from my mom yesterday morning. When she said ""Congratulations Honey! I'm so happy!"" it felt like a lot more than just a stream of tweets and rainbow GIFs. Of course she was quick to follow up by telling me that now that I could legally marry in all 50 states I had zero excuses for not doing so, and the sooner the better. I'm doing my best, Mom, I promise! The happiest day of my adult life After we hung up I began to think about just how long a road this was and how lucky I am to have had so many people fight so hard for so long to get me the same basic rights of anyone else in the Unites States. Growing up in one of the states still steeped in bigotry and inequality, I grew up thinking a day like yesterday couldn't be possible in my future. I can honestly say that yesterday was the happiest day of my adult life. Now if I can just find a way to please my mother, I think we have a real shot at world peace. There are three things on my mind right now: What a wild week to descend from Canada’s frozen tundra into The Verge’s New York office for a visit! I’ll have to work with editorial coordination to make sure all future trips coincide with landmark Supreme Court rulings. It’ll be a weird streak to keep alive. Because I’m still a Canadian resident — Canada legalized same-sex marriage in the summer of 2005, the fourth country to do so — this doesn’t directly impact my life. We still have battles to fight and specific national concerns with which to grapple, but this particular issue was resolved a decade ago and met with its own share of fanfare. With that said, watching my friends and colleagues celebrate yesterday morning as an excited and tangentially affiliated observer has been a purely joyous experience. It’s like the opposite of schadenfreude: pleasure stemming from someone else’s great victory, a completely vicarious kind of joy. Intolerance can be pernicious and shockingly resilient And taking a moment for sobriety: intolerance can be pernicious and shockingly resilient, can wriggle into cracks and crevices only to emerge and shatter your day when you least expect it. (You don’t have to be LGBT to be familiar with these specific and terrible qualities, of course.) The right to marry is a hard-earned victory, but it’ll just as quickly become a crutch for people looking to prop up their microaggressions and their casually sinister behaviour. It doesn’t ease the sting of people’s slurs, doesn’t erase strangers’ disgusted faces when I kiss my boyfriend goodbye, doesn’t stop acquaintances from asking when I chose to date men or how much I love shopping and gabbing with my gal pals. It’s going to take more courage and more hard work to eradicate that kind of behavior, and it might not even happen in my lifetime. But that doesn’t mean we can’t take this weekend to celebrate a big step forward. I’m assuming we’ll hear a lot in the coming weeks about how much social media contributed to making this sweeping change possible. Yesterday was the first time in a long time that I’ve felt any real love for America, and that was largely thanks to social media. Virtually my entire Twitter feed, and the Verge’s entire Twitter audience was an outpouring of love and unbridled excitement about this announcement. It was a distinct joy, curating retweets. It was pretty much an hour-long, nation-wide gigglefest at the expense of bigots. Hello equality, goodbye monsters! Tumblr? Forget about it, that place was red, white, and rainbow all over. The best posts are screenshots of ""Marry me"" texts and ""Marry me, also the cat barfed on your side of the bed"" texts. Our community there is tops. I also had the distinct displeasure of deleting upwards of 100 Facebook comments from our posts announcing the news and announcing our new avatar in celebration of marriage equality. It killed my mood for a minute, I can’t lie, but it also gave me a lot of comfort to know that even though I couldn’t do much, I could block approximately 100 speakers-of-hate from commenting on a Verge Facebook post ever again. Hello equality, goodbye monsters! I’m excited to see what other positive change we can push for and then celebrate online together. As someone who has supported a decision like this for years and considers himself an ally, yesterday's ruling makes me glad. Certainly glad enough that it helps block out the asinine dissenting opinions coming from Justices Scalia and Thomas, but mostly glad that it’s proof that progress is possible. As hard as change is to achieve, it can and does happen. We’re living in the midst of a culture war being played out in almost every aspect of our lives. To be gay, a woman, a trans person, or a person of color is profoundly hard in America, and our exposure to those problems thanks to media and the internet lays out the tug of war between those pushing us forward and those holding us back. People are dying because of it. The stakes are high, and every bloody news story gives us all the reason in the world to believe that the pendulum may swing back to undue a century’s worth of momentum. Yesterday showed that history is on the side of those fighting for the oppressed, year by year and legislative victory after legislative victory. History is on the side of those fighting for the oppressed This is just one moment, though, as powerful and important as it is. Homophobia doesn’t go away with sweeping legal decisions. Watching conservatives tie themselves into knots to characterize the ruling as ""judicial tyranny"" makes that much clear. America still isn’t free in so many ways. So keep marching and making signs. Keep writing petitions to address every last form of systemic injustice that still makes up the fabric of our society. The fight is more than worth it, no matter how long it takes. Not often do we experience history on this scale Yesterday was a day for celebration. A day to recognize the years of struggle, pain, trying days, and perilous nights the LGBTQ community and its allies have been through to reach this point. Yes, there is much more work to be done, and yes, this is only the beginning. But this is a moment we all should cherish. Embrace it and remember every detail about it. Not often do we experience history on this scale, and less often do we stay in the moment. Let’s enjoy this victory. While I'm obviously thrilled about yesterday's news, this doesn't mean the fight for equal rights is won. In 29 states, employees aren't protected against discrimination based on sexual orientation. And 32 states don't protect trans people from gender identity discrimination. The majority of states — 33 — don't protect against housing discrimination, either; gay, lesbian, bi and trans people can be evicted from the homes they rent or denied housing altogether. That's to say nothing of how trans inmates are treated in the prison system — denied hormones, housed in the wrong facilities, or otherwise abused and harassed. Yesterday was a landmark victory, and we should have a landmark celebration. Then we should work to make more victories just like it.  This doesn't mean the fight for equal rights is won Besides the joy of knowing that my gay, lesbian, queer, and bisexual friends are finally getting rights that I can take for granted, my favorite part of yesterday's ruling has been reading the same phrase in statement after statement: ""redefining marriage."" It's something that you're only supposed to say if you hate the decision, but it rings true to me, because redefining things is the central project of progressive politics. We are willing to build the world we want Marriage reform is just the start of LGBT rights, but it says something incredibly important: we are willing to build the world we want. We are willing to take an institution that is rooted in ownership, control, and (literal) patriarchy, and turn it into something that reflects — or at least reflects *more* — love and equality. We aren't beholden to the past, or limited by some fatalistic notion of biological truth. Our only responsibility is to the people around us — and to the ones after us — who will hopefully inherit a better world than the one we got. We're all just one species living on a rock in space, right? We see so much news break over Twitter these days that, for a minute, it didn't hit me that we were truly experiencing a milestone moment in our country's history. But the reality quickly swelled my brain. The amount of effort, energy, hope, and loss that went into fixing this one (majorly) broken part of our society is immeasurable. Coupled with my joy was the immediate awareness of the numerous and formidable problems we all face. Still, buried somewhere under the weight of that realization, yesterday's news has planted hope that reminds us how powerful we are when we fight, communicate, and endure together. Real equality may sound impossible, but after yesterday I think I see it out there on the horizon. We're all just one species living on a rock in space, right?  Yesterday I cried in happiness for my friends and my country. Growing up in a conservative Catholic family, the change in America is reflected in my own past. We are all deserving of dignity and compassion, and I am deeply thankful for yesterday's ruling: it is genuine hope for a better future.",0.9013621713977552,0.09863782860224479,0.8188152742923531,2365,4.8359408033826634,1035,6.4260869565217389,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Editorial"

Now a team of Yelp researchers has teamed up with Tim Wu, the US academic that popularized the concept of net neutrality, to detail how Google gives unfair priority to its own services when performing local searches, and the deleterious effects that practice has on the user's access to useful information. ""Consumers vastly prefer competitive results, as scored by Google's own search engine, than results chosen by Google."" ""Google is reducing social welfare,"" proclaims the introduction to a paper co-authored by Wu, Michael Luca of the Harvard Business School, and the Yelp Data Science Team. The paper presents the findings of a randomized controlled trial wherein purely algorithmic search results are compared to Google's query-specific, tailored results. In some circumstances, there's an obvious benefit to the user — such as when Google provides immediate answers to calculation or conversion queries — but the research also finds instances where that's not the case. With a particular focus on search for local services and information, the researchers find that ""consumers vastly prefer ... competitive results, as scored by Google's own search engine, than results chosen by Google."" Local searches are said to now constitute a third of Google's overall search traffic (the proportion on mobile is even higher, rising to 50 percent), so the way the company handles them is indeed significant. That being said, the metric by which consumer preference is measured in this study is simple clicks: people were 45 percent more likely to click on organic search results than they were on Google's tailored search that presents its own list of nearby businesses or services. Both Wu and his co-author Luca have been paid for their time by Yelp, a major adversary to Google in the sphere of presenting local information, but Wu is adamant that it's the data that has compelled his participation in the study. ""I wouldn’t be doing this if I didn’t think this new evidence was a game-changer,"" he tells Recode, adding that ""this is the closest I’ve seen Google come to the Microsoft case."" The case he's referring to is Microsoft's infamous bundling of the Internet Explorer browser with Windows, which artificially promoted IE's use despite the existence of far superior alternatives. Tim Wu now sees Google doing the same thing with search: ""it’s presenting a version of the product that’s degraded and intentionally worse for consumers.""",0.5282329651810695,0.47176703481893045,0.19574738650973103,425,5.2258823529411762,258,6.1782945736434112,0,0,"Google, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World"

But while the album purports to be a collection of exuberant yet thoughtful synth pop tunes, it's actually something much more revealing: Jepsen is giving us an unprecedented exploration into the occult forces that have given her both pop stardom and eternal life at the cost of her immortal soul. Below, I will detail these forces as E*MO*TION describes them, painting an unsettling portrait of the undead souls that live among us. (Style note: I have used full capitalization for emphasis below, as befits the urgency of the subject matter.) Hints of Jepsen's TRUE NATURE date all the way back to ""Call Me Maybe."" Revelations scholar William Tapley first explained the link in his seminal 2012 video ""The Apocalypse Arrives Gangnam Style!"" According to Tapley, the INESCAPABLE COUPLET ""here's my number / so call me maybe"" in fact refers to the antichrist figure Mabus (first predicted by Nostradamus in the year 1555), identifying himself (herself?) by invoking 666, the number of the beast.  But while Tapley takes this to mean Jepsen is herself Mabus, it can also be read as a REQUEST TO BE SUMMONED INTO THE MORTAL REALM. Here's my number (I am a vampire spirit, aligned with satanic forces), so call me maybe (summon me, Mabus). The clearest indication of Jepsen’s occult nature comes on the song ""Warm Blood."" The song leads off: ""I’ve got a cavern of secrets, none of them are for you."" But as the lyric proceeds, we realize that Jepsen plans to reveal these secrets in the chorus: After attempting to stifle her UNHOLY THIRST FOR THE BLOOD OF THE LIVING, Jepsen has succumbed to her demonic nature and devoured another helpless mortal soul. Like all vampires, she is ultimately in thrall to the forces of evil, and ""can’t control"" her hunger for blood. Later songs confirm this impression, as Jepsen paints herself as a ""SINNER IN SECRET"" who will ""run to your side when your HEART IS BLEEDING"" and cannot ""lay down to die"" because she does not age. The title track delves into powers of vampiric hypnotism, as Jepsen invites the listener to ""be tormented by me."" Further lyrics deal with the persistence of evil (""Black Heart"") and Jepsen’s struggle to live amongst mortal humans (""Boy Problems"").  Do we truly know what she means? We are being offered a chance to transcend the mortal realm, joining the ACCLAIMED SINGER in a SATANIC PACT for immortality. As a vampire, Jepsen has perceptual powers beyond mere mortals, powers we too can achieve by joining her as a damned soul. Who are Joe and Tino? What is their role in this WICKED RITUAL? After hours of study, I am still unsure. (EDITOR’S NOTE: Joe Tino is an anagram for ""Eon I jot,"" a concealed reference to the length of time in which Ms. Jepsen will be writing her intoxicating shanties.) Inevitably, we must also GRAPPLE with the enigma of the album title itself. It is cryptically broken out into three sections ""E-Mo-Tion,"" a puzzle which ultimately reveals that Jepsen is EXPERIENCING TIME ON A SCALE BEYOND HUMAN COMPREHENSION.

Did Carly Rae Jepsen intentionally plant these clues as a sub rosa signal of her true nature? Was she SUBCONSCIOUSLY INFLUENCED BY MABUS or another force yet to be revealed? Is this simply a feint meant to cast doubt on the true nature of Jepsen's relation to the occult? Obviously, further study is required.

In another world, I would have, too. Gory video games about neckless space marines shooting reptilian aliens tend not to be my thing. But it was harder to dismiss Gears of War nine years ago when it was on your TV screen and the controller was in your hands. Its blend of breathtaking visuals and innovative combat made it the first essential Xbox 360 game, and the series remains one of Microsoft’s most important nine years on. Now, ahead of next year’s Gears of War 4, Epic’s original game has been rebuilt for the Xbox One in the shape of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition. Microsoft’s new console has yet to see any games with the impact of Gears, so it’s good to have it back.  Gears of War: Ultimate Edition is the first product from The Coalition, a Microsoft studio devoted to stewarding the future of the franchise — the team will be to Gears what 343 Industries is to Halo. But unlike 343’s Master Chief Collection from last year, which collected the series’ most important entries in one box, Ultimate Edition only focuses on one game (bolstered with some previously PC-exclusive content). It feels a little slight next to The Master Chief Collection, not to mention Sony’s upcoming Uncharted compendium, but it does retail for a semi-knockdown price of $39.99. Early buyers will also be able to download the Xbox 360 versions of Gears 1, 2, 3, and Judgement, and play them on their Xbox One through backwards compatibility. Although The Coalition has given Gears an extensive visual overhaul, it doesn’t wow the senses in the way the original release did back in 2006. Part of that likely has to do with the challenges of working within a nine-year-old framework, but Ultimate Edition also makes some stylistic changes that I’m not convinced are for the better. Gears was a dark, almost monochromatic game upon release, with art direction that felt as relentless as its action. Ultimate Edition brings it closer to its more colorful sequels, and while the technical improvement is clear, it’s hard not to feel that something’s been lost. And it’s disappointing that The Coalition couldn’t achieve a steady 30 frames per second in the single-player mode, particularly in the later levels. But presentation faults aside, the Ultimate Edition is clearly the best way to play Gears of War yet. And if you haven’t played Gears of War, you really should. If you’re not familiar, Gears of War is a third-person shooter with an over-the-shoulder camera that was previously most closely associated with Resident Evil 4. The twist that Gears perfected, and that countless games copied, is the use of cover. Press the A button, and Marcus Fenix, your beefy protagonist, will slam himself against the nearest wall, crate, or box with a satisfying thud, nullifying the effect of pretty much all oncoming enemy fire. That’s a useful thing, because Gears is a game where you will die very quickly if you spend more than a few seconds in the open. The cover system is inspired by and combined with Gears’ tight-as-a-button controls; you’ll find yourself ducking in and out of shelter and popping off fire in a far more cinematic, immersive fashion than any game had achieved before 2006. Of course, it is no longer 2006, and just about every third-person shooter on the planet now has a Gears-like cover system. (Gears itself took the system from Kill.Switch, a not-great PS2 game with a great idea.) But playing through the Ultimate Edition, it’s clear that there are a couple of reasons why Gears still manages to set itself apart. The first reason is its pure attention to detail, with beautiful design flourishes that make a major impact on the experience. Is something amazing happening outside your field of view, like a building collapsing or a helicopter crashing? Press Y when prompted, and the camera will swing in the event’s direction, removing the need for a separate cutscene. Need to get somewhere fast in the thick of battle? Hold down A to ""roadie-run"" from one piece of cover to the next, with a close-up, wide-angle camera that evokes TV war zone reports. Perhaps best of all is the ""active reload"" system. You can just press a single button to reload, but that’ll be slow; instead, that first button press brings up a scrolling gauge with a target to hit by pressing the button a second time. Get it perfect, and you’ll both reload more quickly and do more damage with your next shots. Get it a split-second wrong and your gun will jam, leaving you in danger. It’s a great risk-reward mechanic that turns what would be a chore in most games into something fun. The second and most important way Gears sets remain distinct is level design. With the solid fundamentals established, Gears’ designers were free to construct each stage as a series of virtual playgrounds bursting with ideas. Let me just say it up front: there is very little that you do in Gears beyond shooting aliens. But unlike other similar games, where I often feel the need for respite after endless combat sequences, Gears never gets boring or forgettable. I could reel off most of its variations on a theme like they were Friends episodes. The One Where You’re on a Floating Platform and Have to Turn a Wheel to Cross a River While Taking Enemy Fire. The One Where You Assault Your Father’s House (Which Is Up a Massive Staircase on a Hill) Then Fight Back Once Inside. The One Where You Lure a Terrifying Blind Monster into the Open Through a Series of Increasingly Small Rooms. And so on. Gears is only really about one thing, that much is true. But it’s also about doing a lot of other things while doing that thing, or doing that thing in a lot of different ways. Even the most standard levels are fun to play; your main enemies are subterranean aliens called the Locust, and they all look like Brock Lesnar on a heavy dose of krokodil-infused steroids, which means they can take more than a few bullets. This means you need to outflank them, or use cover to find a way to get close enough to do a lot of damage quickly. Gears can often feel like a puzzle game. I will also go as far as to defend Gears’ story. Yes, it is coated in bro-heavy militarism, though it takes itself less seriously than you might think. But like, say, Mad Max: Fury Road, which no one would think me odd for calling the best movie of the year so far, Gears spins an economical, well-paced tale that quickly establishes an evocative world, shows you its characters’ goals, and tells you how they achieve them with minimal fuss. In the context of an action video game, which are all too often prone to melodramatic excess, it works perfectly. So yes, despite some presentational quibbles, you should absolutely pick up the Ultimate Edition if you have an Xbox One and have never played Gears of War. Maybe even if you did play it. And the fact that it’s one of the very best games on the Xbox One in 2015 serves as somewhat of an indictment of the industry; Gears was the rare blockbuster with brains as well as brawn. No game on the PS4 or Xbox One to date has had the effect and influence of the original Gears. Its graphical might demonstrated why you really ought to upgrade from that PS2, and its mechanical innovations resonate through games even now. Maybe people will play through the Ultimate Edition, think to themselves, ""This game came out nine years ago?!"" and wonder why their minds aren’t being blown in similar fashion today. But the new consoles are still young, and we’re about to head into the holiday / post-holiday onslaught of new releases. Who’s to say one of them won’t turn out be the new Gears? For now, though, we have the old Gears. It’s better than ever, and that’s something to be happy about.

Though it’s available on the PlayStation 4, and you play it with a controller, Until Dawn is really as much a film as it is a game; borrowing from some of the biggest horror franchises around, like Saw to Evil Dead, it combines the tropes into a terrifying experience that’s both familiar and unique. But it’s that added layer of interactivity — the fact that you actually have some measure of control over the events — that makes Until Dawn something special. It’s a horror movie where you can actually tell those stupid teens what to do, in hopes that they’ll actually survive the night.  But if you’re anything like me, you’ll end up making the same mistakes they would. For the first few chapters, Until Dawn feels like a hodgepodge of cliches. Exactly one year after two of their friends mysteriously disappeared, a group of eight high school kids heads up to a secluded cabin on a mountain, with plans for a night of debauchery. A morbid anniversary, reckless teenagers, and a dangerous, isolated mountain (which also happens to be home to a condemned psychiatric hospital): you get where this is going. Until Dawn is happy to stew in those low expectations early on. The kids are almost all obnoxious and bratty, and the creepy, surprisingly huge house and its surrounding area are full of cheap jump scares; you’ll scream, and then you’ll groan. If you need an indication of just how rote the game is initially, one of the key scenes involves a ouija board. About four chapters in, though — after a brutal sequence where you have to make a horrifying choice ripped straight out of Saw — things begin to change. Until Dawn plays like a narrative-heavy adventure game, reminiscent of Telltale games like The Walking Dead or Game of Thrones. You’ll control all of the eight main characters at different points throughout the story, walking them around environments, investigating with a flashlight, talking to people, and making decisions. (There are action sequences, but they’re relegated to quick time events in which you must reflexively hit a button in order to succeed.) Sometimes these choices are small — do you check a phone buzzing in someone’s bag, or respect their privacy? — but much of the time you’re choosing between life and death. And the answer isn’t always clear. When you’re being chased, is it better to hide or keep running? If you had to pick one person to live over another, could you do it? The further you progress, the tougher the choices. Usually when I watch a horror movie, I get angry at how obviously stupid the on-screen characters are. There’s clearly a killer down that darkened hallway, so why would anyone go down there?! But in Until Dawn, in which I’m armed with the knowledge of an observer — I can see the events from multiple perspectives, and I can catch on-screen moments that the characters miss — I still made some bad decisions. According to the developers at Supermassive Games, it’s possible for everyone to make it through the night alive — or for no one at all. In my case, I had a 50 percent success rate with four survivors. That may sound okay, but each death felt like a failure of my intelligence and cunning to keep these kids alive. Because while the characters all start out as bland stereotypes — the dumb jock, the annoying rich girl — Until Dawn does a sly job of turning them into real, believable characters worth caring for. Even after one of the huge plot twists, which renders one member of the group as a seemingly unsympathetic psychopath, I still cared when he ultimately died. Some of this has to do with the great acting, which includes talents like Hayden Panettiere and Peter Stormare, as well as the photorealistic visuals that make the characters look like, well, real people. (The in-game menu shows a close-up of the active character’s face, and when they look directly at you, it’s eerily human.) But the connection you feel with the doomed teens also stems from the fact that you’re as involved in the adventure as they are. When that girl is in shock because her boyfriend died, it’s really because you made a choice that led to his death. Responsibility is as powerful a burden as it is a reward. I found myself particularly attached to one character, and when she died suddenly toward the end of the game, it hit me in the gut. I had a hard time paying attention to the last few minutes of the story, I was in such shock. I couldn’t fix this. You can’t go back to an old save file to try things over. Your mistakes are permanent. Until Dawn is one of those experiences that will have people debating what qualifies a game as a game. There isn’t really a challenge, and when you make a mistake it doesn’t impede your progress, it simply changes the story. But whatever you want to call it, it’s worthy horror; it takes the best of both film and games and combines them into a terrifying, heart-wrenching experience. Often when I finish a game or movie like this, I’m left with lingering questions about what really happened. With Until Dawn, the only real question I have is what might have changed if I had been a little bit smarter, a bit quicker to react. It’s such a strong feeling that I’m planning to play the game again, to spend another 10 hours in a creepy, uncomfortable place, just so that I can see if I can save everyone this time. It turns out those kids aren’t so stupid after all.

There was a time when Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson was unavoidable. With the exception of Snoop Doggy Dogg, it’s difficult to envision a rapper getting a bigger launch: his debut album Get Rich Or Die Tryin’ dominated the pop culture landscape in 2003, selling 12 million copies while its inescapable lead single “In Da Club” stayed at the top of the charts for nine weeks. The album made Rolling Stone’s list of the top 50 albums of the decade and became one of the most commercially successful rap albums of all time. His popularity transcended racial, gender, class, and generational divides. Your grandmother knew who 50 Cent was. She may even have felt comfortable enough with the rapper to refer to him as “Fiddy,” as every white person in the world once did. Backed by his mentors Dr. Dre and Eminem, Jackson once had so much power behind him that it seemed nearly impossible for him to fail. These days, however, it’s nearly impossible to imagine him succeeding. In the limp, late punchline to the grim joke that is his career, Jackson — a rapper whose preoccupation with money was obsessive even in a genre fixated on it — recently declared bankruptcy. A man whose never-released Columbia debut was to be called The Power Of The Dollar, who made a reported $100 million from his stake in Vitamin Water, and who in 2007 was the second wealthiest rapper in the industry — a man who named himself after money — was now conceding he was not financially solvent. A man who rocketed to fame shirtlessly bragging about being richer than everyone else donned a suit to meekly inform the court that he was not the pillar of wealth he was pretending to be.    Jackson’s struggles were once a strength: he was a hip-hop Horatio Alger story who overcame his drug-dealing adolescence and getting shot nine times to become a massive superstar. But he has only himself to blame for his downfall, and now his story has a much darker context: it’s a cautionary tale of how hubris and bad decisions can torpedo any career. Twelve years ago, the idea of 50 Cent pleading for his financial life in bankruptcy court was inconceivable. Today, his bankruptcy engenders not shock or pity but Nelson Muntz-like cackles of ""Ha ha!"" That's because Jackson’s fall is among the most deserved in pop culture, to the point a would-be rhetorical question like ""where did it all go wrong?"" has multiple, specific answers. Here are 10 of the seemingly infinite mistakes he made en route from being one of rap’s biggest winners to one of its biggest losers. By his own account, 50 Cent’s mother was bisexual, and like many heterosexual men, he’s a lot more accepting / turned-on by the concept of women loving women than he is about men loving men. In a 2004 interview with Playboy, 50 Cent told writer Rob Tennenbaum, ""I ain’t into faggots. I don’t like gay people around me, because I’m not comfortable with what their thoughts are. I’m not prejudiced. I just don’t go with gay people and kick it — we don’t have that much in common. I’d rather hang out with a straight dude. But women who like women, that’s cool. I could actually get into that, having a woman who likes women, too. We might have more in common."" 50 Cent goes on to explain, ""It’s okay to write that I’m prejudiced. This is as honest as I could possibly be with you. When people become celebrities, they change the way they speak. But my conversation with you is exactly the way I would have a conversation on the street. We refer to gay people as faggots, as homos. It could be disrespectful, but that’s the facts."" So don’t hate on 50 Cent: he’s just being honest about his disdain for faggots and his desire to not have them around him, and he’s from the streets, where it’s okay to call people faggots and homos. Later, the rapper revised his public take on homosexuality, but in 2010 he did tweet, ""Perez Hilton calld [sic] me a douchebag so I had my homie shoot up a gay wedding. wasnt [sic] his but still made me feel better."" Six-time Academy Award nominee Jim Sheridan famously implored Jackson to trust his own instincts rather than professionals on the set of 2005's Get Rich Or Die Tryin'. Crowing to CHUD.com that his lead's preparation included ""No art. No voice coaches, no acting coaches, no bullshit,"" Sheridan went on to infamously boast that he told Jackson, ""You know, if this movie fails, it won't be because you can't act, it's because I didn't direct you right."" By Sheridan's criteria, he did a terrible job directing Get Rich, because the film was a critical — and commercial — failure. Despite the acclaim that greeted Sheridan's previous films, Get Rich Or Die Tryin' has a 16 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Anne Hornaday of The Washington Post captured the tone of the film's pans when she dubbed it ""shockingly inert"" and said that Jackson was ""oddly distant and detached as a performer."" A decade later, Jackson has yet to prove to anyone that he can act. He remains an eternal dilettante, always aspiring, never quite there. Jackson rose to fame partially on the strength of ""Wanksta,"" a devastating early diss track that played a huge role in ending the career of the rapper’s arch-rival Ja Rule. In the years that followed, Jackson kept beefing with everyone and everything, but it wasn’t just his new music that paled in comparison to his early stuff: his new beefs were petty and strained, and informed by increasingly knee-jerk misogyny. In the dour 2005 diss song ""Piggy Bank,"" Jackson pointlessly went after respected New York cult rapper Jadakiss for having the gall to record a song (""New York"") with Ja Rule. But elsewhere, he seemed offended simply at the idea of rappers being in love with women they treat with respect. On ""Piggy Bank,"" the rapper taunts, ""Kelis say her milkshake bring all the boys to the yard / then Nas went and tattooed the bitch on his arm / I’m way out in Cali / Niggas know you cus / First thing they say about you is you’s a sucka for love."" Ever eager to prove that he was not a sucker for love, the rapper later went after Shaniqua Tompkins, the mother of his son Marquise on the 2009 diss track, ""So Disrespectful,"" taunting, ""They say first comes love, then comes marriage / Instead I got Shaniqua and a baby carriage / Then came the cash and the baby mama drama / I gave that bitch half a mil she blew it on Prada."" (In 2009, Tompkins unsuccessfully sued Jackson for tens of millions in child support.) When Kanye West decided to release his third album, Graduation, the same day as 50 Cent’s Curtis, Jackson spied an opportunity to create a rivalry to pump up sales. The rapper vowed to end his solo career if Kanye sold more copies the first week out. But when West won by something like a quarter million units, Jackson surprised no one by not making good on his promise. From the perspective of 2015, the rivalry, which had the unmistakable feel of an internal sales stunt (the two rappers' labels were both under the Universal Music Group umbrella), was as much a battle between wildly conflicting ideologies as it was anything else. 50 embodied a retrograde conception of the alpha-male as boorish chauvinist pig, while West personified the endlessly complicated future. As Jackson’s defeats go, this wasn’t so bad — he still managed to sell over 600,000 copies in the first week. But if West conclusively won this particular battle, he slaughtered Jackson in the war. Eight years later, West is as relevant and respected as ever, while 50 Cent is a figure and phenomenon that people think about in the past tense. Of course, that doesn't stop Jackson from continuing to take shots from the sidelines. When asked by XXL in 2012 about ""Perfect Bitch"", West's ode to his current wife Kim Kardashian, Jackson opined, ""One man’s trash is another man’s treasure."" Young Buck is a rapper so loyal that he stood trial for allegedly attacking a man with some form of cutlery while defending Dr. Dre at The Vibe Awards (the police thought it was a knife, videotape suggested it was a fork). That's the kind of man you'd want on your side, unless you're 50 Cent. In an attempt to diversify G-Unit's sound and appeal, Young Buck joined Jackson's G-Unit crew / label at the height of its popularity, but like seemingly everyone in his circle, Young Buck came to regret joining forces with Jackson. After Young Buck reportedly led a chant of ""Fuck G-Unit"" at a show, Jackson decided to publicly humiliate his collaborator by furtively taping a phone conversation in which Buck tearfully professed his eternal allegiance to G-Unit. The idea was to expose Young Buck as a groveler who committed the shameful sin of possessing emotions, but the stunt just made 50 Cent seem like a sociopath who turns on protégés with shocking callousness. Taking a private, dark-night-of-the-soul phone call public wasn't a boss move, it was just a dick move. Jackson could not resist the tawdry siren song of reality television. But what would his reality show be about? Why money, of course. In 2008, Jackson ripped huge chunks out of the Donald Trump celebrity playbook and launched 50 Cent: The Money And The Power. The show was a knockoff of The Apprentice that found a bunch of hungry hustlers, divided subtly into Team Money and Team Power, competing for the opportunity to win $100,000 and impress Jackson. Trump opined that the show would ""fail because (50 Cent is) not Trump,"" which turned out to be a rare instance of Trump being correct. Usually, not being Trump is a strength; when launching a The Apprentice rip-off, however, it's a weakness. Beyond being nakedly derivative, The Money And The Power was further done in by clumsy plugs for other products in Jackson's media empire, degrading challenges (such as one in which the members of competing teams were shackled together, chain gang style), and competitors who were exactly the kind of loathsome exhibitionists you find on any other reality competition. The show was swiftly canceled due to low ratings, and its failure further diminished the credibility of the 50 Cent brand. Like seemingly everything he did circa 2005, Bulletproof, Jackson’s first foray into video games, was a success, selling over a million copies. Bulletproof found 50 and his G-Unit cronies in a comfortably on-brand street-revenge scenario involving Jackson going after the hit men who tried to kill him.  But for some reason, the game’s follow-up, 2009’s Blood In The Sand, took the action from the inner city to an unnamed Middle Eastern country, where 50 and his sidekicks are tasked with retrieving a diamond-encrusted skull worth millions. The game got better reviews than Bulletproof, but sold a fraction of what the earlier game did, perhaps because Jackson making a Middle Eastern-set video game about a diamond skull was about as off-brand for the G-Unit head honcho as humanly possible, unless Jackson decided to sponsor an modern improvisational dance troupe. Hip-hop’s code of authenticity should have given 50 Cent a huge advantage in his beef with Rick Ross. Jackson had sold crack and been shot multiple times, giving him instant cred, whereas Ross was a morbidly obese Notorious B.I.G. soundalike with a shameful past as a prison guard. That probably explains why Jackson felt confident going after him, but it turned out fans didn’t care about where rappers came from so much as what they were currently doing. Ross’ backstory consequently didn’t matter as much as his ability to crank out the kind of catchy hits Jackson once churned out effortlessly. There was a time when Jackson could have ended Rick Ross’ career with a diss track. Instead, the beef ended up irrevocably harming Jackson’s career: his constant attacks on Ross did nothing to harm the outsized rapper’s ascent to superstardom, while Jackson entered a steep professional downward spiral. In videos on his website and on YouTube, Jackson depicted himself as the champion of the unfortunate women Ross had abandoned and mistreated. To that end, he gives a forum to Ross’ ex Tia, who, in a rant that now feels deliciously ironic given Jackson’s recent woes, tells the camera that Ross was merely feigning wealth with rented jewels and cars. Ever the gentleman, Jackson then pulls out a sleazy skin mag and shows a picture of Lastonia Leviston (or ""Brooke"" as she is identified in the video), a woman he claims is a call girl (or ""really exclusive whore"" in his charming turn of phrase) in addition to being the mother of one of Ross’ children. The beef set in motion the chain of events that would lead to Jackson begging for mercy in bankruptcy court, when his undying desire to humiliate Ross led to him leaking a sex tape that ultimately resulted in a costly lawsuit for Jackson. After ascending to superstardom, Jackson puzzlingly seized upon YouTube as a showcase for his material that just couldn’t wait to go through traditional channels. This mostly consists of homemade videos in which he wears silly costumes, talks in silly voices, and mugs his way through ostensibly comic vignettes. Jackson’s signature YouTube character is Pimpin’ Curly, a procurer of prostitutes with Eriq LaSalle’s hair from Coming To America and a voice out of a blaxploitation movie. Unlike most YouTube videos, 50 Cent’s Pimpin’ Curly videos have millions of views on YouTube (they are also hosted on Jackson’s own website). But otherwise, they're remarkably similar to most other comedy videos on YouTube in that they are a self-indulgent waste of everyone’s time. That especially goes for Jackson himself, who became inexplicably fixated on amateur sketch comedy rather than, say, his music or his family. It’d be tempting to dismiss these curious exercises as harmless ways for Jackson to amuse himself (if only himself) except that Pimpin’ Curly put in a cameo in the leaked sex tape that is the source of his current financial woes. Pimpin' Curly wasn't 50's only outlet for his extra-musical creativity. Jackson also took what appeared to be his grandma's camcorder and wrote, directed, and starred in the insanely awful Before I Self Destruct, a DVD of which was included with his album of the same name. Thus Jackson found a way to disappoint fans in multiple media at once with a hilariously inept melodrama about an athlete who gets wrapped up in gang violence in an attempt to provide for his brother, a 12-year-old genius who has already been accepted to every Ivy League institution. Yes, Jackson made a movie where the B plot involves a pint-sized super-genius, and remarkably, that's probably the film's most realistic aspect. Jackson didn’t get good roles following Get Rich for an understandable reason: he is a terrible actor incapable of playing a character based on himself, much less anyone else. Eager to broaden his range beyond his default role of ""drug dealer in generic thrillers,"" Jackson took the unusual and extreme step of losing 54 pounds and co-writing and personally financing All Things Fall Apart, in which he plays a college football star who goes from being a serious contender for the Heisman Trophy to being diagnosed with cancer. That is remarkable dedication — especially since Jackson was a 35-year-old man playing a college kid — but even if he was born the same day as his character, he still wouldn’t have been able to sell it. The Raging Bull scary-weight-loss route may work for seasoned actors, but the response to his bid for respectability was the same as all his films: it was barely released in theaters and became a punchline for the critics that Jackson had hoped to impress. With All Things Fall Apart, Jackson tried to establish himself as a serious actor; instead he merely cemented his reputation as a deluded narcissist. While the path to Jackson’s bankruptcy was long and eventful, the ultimate catalyst was a  multi-million-dollar lawsuit Jackson lost against Lastonia Leviston, the ex-girlfriend of rival Rick Ross, who accused Jackson of leaking a sex tape featuring her in an attempt to humiliate her ex-boyfriend back in 2009. The sex tape leak embodies everything that makes Jackson deplorable Leaking the sex tape neatly embodied everything that makes Jackson deplorable: the sociopathic intensity of his beefs, his entitlement, even Pimpin’ Curly, who makes an appearance early in the video through the magic of editing. Maybe Jackson can try to save face and argue that Pimpin’ Curly took over his mind, Jekyll and Hyde style, and made all the terrible mistakes that took his alter-ego from the penthouse to the gutter in 12 tumultuous years. After all, 50 Cent spent much of his career cultivating an image as a cool, collected, consummate businessman not ruled by emotions, and that person clearly could have not have consistently made such awful decisions. Pimpin’ Curly, on the other hand — now that is a man who is not to be trusted.

Unfortunately, 14 percent of those people didn’t know they were infected, according to a CDC report released today. And as of 2012, only five states in the US had met the National HIV/AIDS Strategy objective of making sure that at least 90 percent of people living with HIV know their status by 2015. In Louisiana, 23 percent of people living with HIV didn't know their status When it comes to HIV prevalence and testing, there’s a pretty big gap between the states. In Louisiana, 23 percent of people living with HIV didn't know their status in 2012, compared with just 10 percent of people living with HIV in Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, and New York. This is the first time that the CDC has released these estimates, says Irene Hall, chief of the HIV incidence and case surveillance branch at the CDC and one of the authors of the report. ""These data really underscore the need to have ongoing efforts that increase testing,"" she says. People who don’t know that they have HIV contribute one-third of transmissions, according to the CDC. That means that increasing the number of people who are aware of their status is crucial to reducing transmission rates across the country. Not to mention that ""knowledge of one’s HIV status is key to accessing effective HIV treatment,"" Hall says.   The agency’s estimates were obtained thanks to mathematical modelling. To come up with the percentage of people who are infected with HIV, but don’t know about it, Hall and her colleagues first estimated the total number of infections. From that they subtracted the estimated percentage of diagnosis, which gave them the percentage of undiagnosed cases of HIV. That’s how the researchers were able to figure out that Louisiana wasn't doing nearly as well as Hawaii in 2012, for instance. The number of infections also varies widely based on location. For example, Iowa saw 110 cases of HIV for every 100,000 people in 2012. But in the District of Columbia, that number was almost 4,000 cases for every 100,000 people. ""What I see from the data is that all jurisdictions have room for improvement,"" Hall says. ""States need to monitor their progress, and then focus their prevention efforts."" Gay and bisexual men are still disproportionately affected by HIV Additionally, the CDC’s report underscores the fact that gay and bisexual men are still disproportionately affected by HIV. Over 60 percent of people who received an HIV diagnosis in 2011 were gay and bisexual men. And in 2012, the number gay and bisexual men living with HIV ranged from 1,600 in Delaware to about 134,000 in California. For many states, hitting the national goal this year will be an uphill battle The CDC’s estimates show that, in many areas, increasing the number of people who know their status by 2015 will be an uphill battle. ""There is some delay in getting the data reported before we can get it published, so hopefully by 2015 more states will have met the 90 percent standard,"" Hall says. ""but it’s too early to make predictions about that."" National HIV testing day is June 27th.

Vitamin B12 alters how the genes of facial bacteria behave — a change that in turn promotes inflammation, which has been linked to pimples in the past. The finding could eventually help create new drugs that can keep acne away. But it’s still very early, so the researchers warn against making any drastic changes to your diet or habits for now. ""It has been reported several times that people who take B12 develop acne."" People sometimes take B12 as a supplement to improve memory or combat anemia. But ""it has been reported several times that people who take B12 develop acne,"" says Huiying Li, a molecular pharmacologist at the University of California-Los Angeles and a co-author of the study. ""So it’s exciting that we found that the potential link between B12 and acne is through the skin bacteria."" More than 80 percent of teenagers and young adults have to deal with acne, often on a regular basis. It can go away on its own, but it can also lead to some pretty bad scarring — not to mention some big dips in self-esteem. Unfortunately, researchers don’t know nearly as much about this particular skin condition as one might expect. Scientists have shown that the production of sebum — the oily, waxy stuff your skin makes — and a disorder of the cells that line the inside of hair follicles are both involved in acne development, but the role of bacteria in those pimples we all dread still holds some mysteries. That's why Li and her team of researchers decided to look into B12. Since the 1950s, a number of studies have linked the vitamin to acne, but that association was largely anecdotal, Li says. And the researchers had suspected that the vitamin might have an effect on skin bacteria, most notably Propionibacterium acnes. Now, Li and her team think they may have figured out how B12 acts on P. acnes, thanks to experiments her team performed on bacteria taken from a small number of people. The study revealed that humans taking B12 end up with high levels of the vitamin in their skin. As a result, P. acnes senses these higher levels and lowers its own production of B12, which it uses to carry out its everyday bacteria-like activities. This causes an imbalance that prompts P. acnes to produce more porphyrins, a related molecule. And unfortunately porphyrins are linked to inflammation — a pretty important factor in the development of severe acne. ""The main message is that skin bacteria are important."" Thus, it seems likely that for some people, taking B12 causes inflammation in the skin, which leads to acne. That last step in this pimply chain of events has yet to be demonstrated, however. Doing so will take a bit more time, Li says. ""The main message is that skin bacteria are important,"" Li says. They're contributing members of our skin's society, and they like to do things in a certain manner. But until other researchers confirm the link between B12 and acne in a larger number of people, dermatologists won’t really be able to make any clinical recommendations one way or the other, she says. Still, just knowing about the ways in which we can affect the organisms that live on our skin is pretty fun. ""I don't want people to misinterpret the results by not taking B12,"" Li says — this is all about the bacteria.",0.6377476235174954,0.36225237648250463,0.2055672983635185,600,4.7583333333333337,332,5.7590361445783129,0,0,"Science, Report"

That was the philosophy the FDA broadcast earlier this year when it unveiled its ""draft guidance"" for low-risk medical devices, a non-binding proposal that described the agency's thinking on regulation of devices like wearable fitness trackers. The guidance effectively suggests the agency won't vigorously regulate devices as long as they're not harmful and generally encourage healthy habits. Many devices with less-than-stellar track records for accuracy — such as calorie counters — would likely not be covered under the guidance. ""Basically [we are] being transparent in where the FDA is focusing their enforcement efforts,"" says Bakul Patel, associate director for digital health at the FDA. But the comments on the proposal, publicly released last week, show that some of the world's biggest tech industry groups and companies are pushing the FDA to make the lax regulations more explicit. ""The right time [to make the guidance] would've been five years ago."" The draft guidance, ""General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices,"" describes which devices the agency believes it should focus on regulating. That includes ""general wellness"" products, which are described in two ways. First, the products that either have ""an intended use that relates to maintaining or encouraging a general state of health or a healthy activity,"" such as a device that helps ""log, track, or trend exercise activity."" The devices may also have ""an intended use claim that associates the role of healthy lifestyle with helping to reduce the risk or impact of certain chronic diseases or conditions"" when the science clearly shows a healthy lifestyle can have an impact. (The FDA already considers something a ""medical device"" if it's used to diagnose or treat a disease.) ""Low risk"" products, according to the guidance, are non-invasive and generally do not ""pose a risk to a user’s safety if device controls are not applied."" The FDA is making the guidance at a time when the wearable tech is already a cycle years in the making. ""The right time [to make the guidance] would've been five years ago,"" says Bradley Merrill Thompson, a member of the firm at Epstein Becker & Green who focuses on medical device regulation. Android Wear and the Apple Watch are already here, adding features constantly. The agency has already recommended letting some medical apps go to market without regulatory supervision, and the new guidance is arguably just an extension of that fact. But as the scope of medical devices has increased, device makers have asked the FDA to define exactly where the regulatory line is. Samsung, which produces wearables like the Gear family of devices, has asked the FDA for explicit mentions of some types of products — and has even gone so far as to suggest the language the agency should use in its final guidance. The company wants to make sure the FDA won't regulate some devices that store data, such as an app that stores blood glucose or blood pressure data from another device. The company's suggested addition is this: ""Product X promotes physical activity, which, as part of a healthy lifestyle, may help reduce the risk of high blood pressure. If Product X also includes [a Medical Device Data System] feature for tracking and displaying blood pressure data that is generated by a connected medical device, this will not disqualify Product X from being considered a wellness product."" The Consumer Electronics Association asks that products ""similar to a ‘mood ring'"" go unregulated Similarly, the Telecommunications Industry Association, which represents hundreds of companies, suggested the FDA include references to a ""mobile medical application"" that would store blood pressure and glucose information, whether inputted by the user or wirelessly sent to an app. And the Consumer Electronics Association, the massive trade organization behind CES, said in its comments that it wants certain specific examples included in the guidance. The CEA suggests a wearable device for tracking mood — a product ""similar to a ‘mood ring,'"" according to the filing, an idea that has resulted in scientifically dubious products before — should be included as a ""general wellness"" product under the guidance. But it doesn't just end at mood trackers — other devices that the CEA suggests should be considered general wellness products include those that promote a healthy diet by tracking or reducing the amounts people eat of things like sodium or sugar; those devices meant to help people avoid unhealthy behavior, like devices that support smoking cessation; and devices meant to prevent injury. The FDA, then, is working a balancing act: craft a policy detailed enough to offer guidance, but broad enough to give itself latitude. ""It's hard to put in that precision without putting handcuffs on yourself,"" Thompson says. Although it's clear some devices would still be regulated — the FDA cites products like computer games that claim to treat autism, or other products that claim to treat anxiety — the device makers, it seems, want the line as bright as a mood ring. The agency is working on the final version of the guidance, but hasn't laid out a timeframe for when it will be completed, although device makers are pushing for it to happen soon. In the meantime, the tech industry has made it clear that they believe regulation, in the CEA's words, shouldn't stop consumers from having the ability to ""self-manage"" their health. ""We recognize and support FDA's authority to regulate medical devices,"" the CEA writes in its comment, ""but believe that consumers should have access to low risk technology that will enable them to live a healthier lifestyle.""",0.446273431044791,0.553726568955209,0.530175535583835,945,5.1925925925925922,473,6.4143763213530658,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World, Report"

That’s when Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth was released. While it’s fair to criticize the documentary for being infotainment, it’s irresponsible to deny the central argument: the risks from climate change are real and the overwhelming cause is humanity’s lust for fossil fuels. Still, everyone has a brother-in-law in Texas or an aunt in Ohio for whom a preponderance of scientific evidence pales in comparison to their personal feels. Who hasn’t heard someone make the following quip just as soon as the temperature dips below normal: so much for global warming. Fortunately, the tools used to persuade climate deniers are getting simpler and simpler. On Tuesday, Bill Nye released a video explaining climate change with emoji. Yesterday, Bloomberg released a bunch of animated pictures that also debunk other theories. And as of last week, you can now tell 1.2 billion Roman Catholics that even the Pope says the man-made threat is real. But not everyone has to be on board. Yesterday, 886 people in the Netherlands won a class-action lawsuit that forces the government to reduce the country’s greenhouse emissions. In a legal precedent, the court ruled that the state has a legal requirement to protect its citizens from the threat of climate change. ""The state should not hide behind the argument that the solution to the global climate problem does not depend solely on Dutch efforts,"" the ruling said. ""Any reduction of emissions contributes to the prevention of dangerous climate change and as a developed country the Netherlands should take the lead in this."" Look, there will always be a fringe of Obama Birthers, 9/11 Truthers, and whatever you call Oliver Stone’s views on JFK. But as the Dutch proved, even a few acting locally can have global impact.  It seems like the longer that certain elements of society deny the existence of climate change, the more scientists have to use ever-simpler arguments to get their point across.

A front page led by the day’s biggest news. A selection of stories, chosen by editors, arranged more or less by importance. And inside, a bundle of sections highlighting various subjects: arts and entertainment, business, technology, and health. That describes a newspaper, the beloved but fading institution that has spent the past decade hollowing itself out. But it also describes Circa, the news app that announced today it’s shutting down. And in those similarities lay the seeds of its failure. French taxi drivers today blocked roads to airports and train stations in Paris, as part of a nationwide protest against Uber. Thousands of drivers are expected to participate in today's strike in the French capital and other major cities, where tensions between taxi unions and private car services are running high. Protestors burned tires and turned over cars along major thoroughfares, and there have been reported scuffles between taxi drivers and other chauffeurs. Police in riot gear intervened at one point with tear gas, Reuters reports. The notoriously passive-aggressive Taylor Swift is getting a dose of her own medicine this week.

An Atlanta warehouse overstepped the bounds of the law in its quest to discover a mystery pooper, according to a ruling by a Federal circuit court in Atlanta this week. The case began when the warehouse, run by Atlas Logistics Group, began finding piles of excrement in the public workspace, and was forced to investigate who might be behind the string of mysterious crappings. Based on the scene of the crime, the company suspected an inside job, but it had no firm evidence aside from the poop itself.

The program is led by Bybi, an environmental group supporting urban bee populations, and has secured funding from local companies. Some of these firms have provided dedicated homes for new bee populations, kitting out rooftops and terraces with hives alongside pollen-producing plants. Bee populations, hives, and movements can be tracked on a dedicated site run by the groups behind the scheme — if your Norwegian is up to scratch. The project is similar to the White House's planned ""butterfly highway"" The program is similar to the ""butterfly highway"" announced by the White House earlier this year. The large-scale American scheme will create and maintain a 1,500-mile corridor of vegetation between Mexico and Minnesota that aims to replenish dwindling Monarch butterfly populations. Both bees and butterflies have vital roles as plant pollinators — 30 to 40 percent of food production requires pollination — but both creatures have suffered huge hits in recent years. Honey bees started dying off en masse in 2006, a process that has continued in recent years, with 31 percent of the US commercial bee population disappearing in 2012 alone. Researchers have blamed pesticides and disease for the collapse of thousands of colonies, but no definitive explanation for why so many are dying has yet been put forward.

INRIX — which aggregates real-time road traffic information from a variety of sources and offers it to automakers, municipalities, and news outlets — will announce its On-Street Parking product at the TU-Automotive conference near Detroit later today. The service keeps track of parking availability on a block-by-block basis, which automakers will be able to integrate into their navigation systems.   An example of how parking data shows on BMW's prototype. Green indicates higher availability; red is lower. INRIX uses a variety of data sources to suss out how much parking is available on a given block, and those data sources have grown considerably with the proliferation of connected cars: the company can often get indicators like location, whether cars' transmissions are in park or drive, and eventually, ultrasonic and LIDAR sensor data that can ""see"" open spaces. (Ford is actively working on a pilot program along similar lines.) It combines this with pricing data from cities and private parking facilities to offer complete visualizations of where parking is light, where it's heavy, and what you'll pay at each spot. Cars that use INRIX's data could, for instance, find the cheapest nearby parking and route you to it automatically.   This kind of information can produce some pretty stunning pictures of a city's ebb and flow — see the animation above, for instance, which shows parking demand fluctuate throughout the course of a day in San Francisco's Civic Center area. BMW is demonstrating On-Street Parking using a specially fitted i3 at the conference today, and it'll be debuting the service in production vehicles later on. Parking availability services aren't new; Parkopedia, for instance, catalogs real-time availability and pricing, and is available in-car on Ford's AppLink. But by incorporating data coming off individual cars, INRIX's service may be the most advanced — it can get a sense of availability even when spaces aren't wired with sensors to detect the presence of cars. (As is often the case with connected car services, privacy is a concern here, but INRIX notes that data is already anonymized by the time it receives it.) The service launches first in Seattle, Vancouver, San Francisco, Amsterdam, Cologne, and Copenhagen, expanding to a total of 23 cities by the end of the year.

Customers want a range of at least 100 miles for $20,000 The main problems, says Levatich, are cost and range. The three dozen LiveWire prototypes produced by Harley are only good for around 50 miles before they need recharging, and customers reportedly expect to get at least double that. Similarly, Levatich says people are willing to pay around $20,000 for an electric motorcycle from Harley, but at that price the company wouldn't make any profit.

What you're looking at here is what the RM Sotheby's auction house is calling the ""Pinnacle Portfolio,"" a collection of roughly 30 post-World War II cars that Reuters reports could get over $65 million when they're individually auctioned at this August's Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. To be clear, these cars are single-sourced — one person currently owns them. Shelby Myers of RM Sotheby's sums up the absurdity and anonymity of the collection pretty well: ""While many of the world’s most impressive collections were established in the public eye of the car-collecting world, The Pinnacle Portfolio was assembled with a clandestine, surgical precision unlike any other that has come to market. Its almost obsessive focus on perfection, rarity, and the superlative, irrespective of price, makes it the most significant and valuable private collection of motor cars ever presented at auction."" Only a fraction of the collection has been unveiled thus far, but it's already dropping jaws: highlights include the first production Bugatti Veyron (just shown at Geneva this year alongside La Finale), the second-to-last road-going McLaren F1 ever built, and the last Ferrari Enzo — number 400, which was a gift to Pope John Paul II from former Ferrari chairman Luca Cordero di Montezemolo. Many of the cars have barely any miles on the clock. You'd have a hard time building this collection in a racing video game, much less in real life. The list goes on: there's also a Jaguar XJ220, a Koenigsegg CCXR, the ultra-limited Lamborghini Reventón of which only 20 were made, and a Porsche 959, considered by many Porsche collectors to be a holy grail.

Can it stay relevant against Google and Apple? AppLink and SmartDeviceLink give mobile app developers a platform for interacting with the car, the driver, and the dashboard, so that phone apps can be safely used on the road using the car's controls. The technology has the advantage of being already rolled out — Ford says it has over 5 million AppLink-enabled cars on the road already — which means Toyota doesn't need to fight as big of an uphill battle to bring developers on board as it would with a homegrown platform. And inasmuch as automakers still want their dashboards to look customized and branded, SmartDeviceLink allows them to do that; Android Auto and CarPlay do not. Still, Apple and Google are well positioned to win this war in the long term. Ford's AppLink catalog only shows a few dozen apps in total spread across iOS and Android — but Julius Marchwicki, product manager for Ford's connected services, believes SmartDeviceLink's role is complementary, not competitive.

Sometimes, these are meant to be unsettling: Conversnitch put secret microphones in public places and transcribed the conversations they captured to Twitter, and People Staring at Computers brought him scrutiny from the Secret Service. But others are serendipitous and delightful: working for Spotify, he created a map (which is in fact known as Serendipity) where visitors can see when any two users start playing the same song at the exact same time. In 2013, McDonald was commissioned to create an art installation in Korea. His project, Sharing Faces, placed mirror-like screens in the Korean city of Anyang and in Yamaguchi, Japan. When a visitor looked into it, they would see someone else's face — placed and posed like their own. When they moved, the screen would cycle through images and find one matching the new pose, creating the impression of a morphing person following your every move. The images came from other visitors to the installations, whose pictures were captured while they stared at the images. Every time you watched other people match the way you moved, you were creating material for some future visitor to see. The technical details of its face capture and tracking are on Github, and they help illuminate the project a bit. Conceptually, though, it's a neat and elegant idea, a mirror that shows you other people's faces — McDonald suggested the collaboration with Japanese artists because of the ongoing cultural and political tension between the two countries.

Industrial designers love to be provocative almost as much as they enjoy being original. Fulfilling both briefs with a furious disregard for common sense, leading French designer Philippe Starck has this week unveiled a new range of electric bikes. Dubbed Starckbike and built by e-bike specialists Moustache, the new collection features four distinct styles, each with ""specific ergonomics adapted to its terrain and field of exploration."" The Mud Starckbike is designed for all-terrain adventuring. While it lacks any actual mudguards, it makes up for it with a tasteful ""medium hot grayscale"" color scheme and a selection of high-end components. The Asphalt is tuned for comfort on urban roads, and the Sand and Snow (pictured above) come with fat tyres to help them negotiate the surfaces that give them their respective names. Only the Snow Starckbike adds something a little extra: a synthetic fur cover for its battery. That's complemented by a similarly fuzzy set of accessories, including gloves, a backpack, and a fur-lined helmet. It's all quite ridiculous and thoroughly delightful to behold. Then again, what else would you expect from the man who designed Steve Jobs' futuristic yacht and the Blade Runner hard drive? The Mud Starckbike. The stitching on the handlebars is evocative of luxury steering wheel design in cars. Clockwise from top left: the Mud, Asphalt, Snow, and Sand gloves. Each pair has been designed in partnership with boutique glove maker Causse to match the particular use of its respective bike. The Asphalt Starckbike alongside its custom-tailored backpack. A set of four handmade pairs of sunglasses accompanies the bike collection. The fur-lined Snow backpack. Produced by Giro, here's the fur-lined Snow helmet, replete with visor, to complete the look.

We spent some serious time making sure we kept the soul of our beautiful design as we made the site responsive, but don’t be fooled by what looks like visual changes only — under the hood, there’s a completely rebuilt codebase that will allow us to iterate more quickly and deliver new features as fast as we can think of them. Think of it like Verge Hack Week, but for the site itself. Like all Vox Media sites, The Verge is built on Chorus, the industry’s best publishing platform, and with Verge 2.0 we’re ready to start pushing Chorus forward in really exciting new ways. It’s going to be rad. No more mobile site, no tablet site, no desktop site — just one Verge for everything This also means that our dedicated apps and API for third-party apps will be going away. Apps are great, but The Verge is a website, and we want people to have the best experience with our content where it is created and designed to be viewed. Which is on the web. Because we’re a website. There will be a relatively short transition period as we take down the apps and eventually turn off the API; this is a great time to switch your bookmarks and home screen icons to our site. (Most major smartphone platforms have gotten much better at saving a website to your home screen, and our icon looks quite fetching there. In Safari on iOS, it’s a tap away in the Share menu, the square icon with the arrow sticking out. In Chrome on Android, it’s an option under the menu. On Windows Phone, it’s also an option under the More menu.) In other exciting news, we’re also launching a new section of the site we’re calling TL;DR. In the spirit of old-school blogging, we wanted a space to share our thoughts with a thinner filter, make cool things, and point people to other great stuff on the web. It’s a new section, but it feels like a return to something we’ve been doing for a long time. We’re going to be trying lots of different things in this space, and we’re eager to hear your feedback.1 Thanks to those of you who have been helping us beta test for the past few weeks. Because of your help, we’ve been able to identify and squash a ton of bugs. We’ve tried really hard, but it’s still not perfect. You can send reports to support@theverge.com. All urgent issues will be immediately fixed once reported. We’ve left a few of our long-form articles in the non-responsive layout, but we’ll be switching some over on a case-by-case basis.

At the time of this writing, the project had raised $10,388,188, or 20,805 percent of its goal.   Ten million dollars for a beverage container is an amazing feat. But it's even more astounding considering creator Ryan Grepper launched almost exactly the same campaign ten months ago and failed. He only raised $102,188 on a $125,000 goal. ""When I launched my first campaign for the Coolest last November, I thought that if you started with a good enough idea, people would find it and success was inevitable,"" Grepper told GeekWire. ""When the campaign failed, I took a hard look at what went wrong. I did not give up."" So what did he do differently? Not that much, it turns out. But the small differences, plus the wisdom of launching a campaign for an outdoor accessory in August rather than November, added up. Here's Grepper's take: 1. People are much more interested in coolers in the summer rather than the winter. 2. We had a group of passionate supporters from our first campaign, ready to take up the charge and share among their friends. 3. We improved the COOLEST design, took a more targeted marketing approach and focused our video on all the great features offered. The videos for the two campaigns are almost exactly the same length and feature much of the same footage. The rewards are very similar, although the new campaign featured a $165-level for ""early bird"" backers who could get the cooler, and made $2,000 the highest tier rather than $5,000. The first version of the Coolest had an attachable grill, which Grepper got rid of in version 2.0 due to safety concerns. Otherwise, the second version of the Coolest boasts all the original features as well as a few extras, including built-in storage for utensils and plates, wider wheels, and a USB charger. (The charger was suggested by a backer from the original campaign, and seem like the only feature that may have made a difference, but what do I know.) Other changes: Grepper asked for $50,000 instead of $125,000. The Kickstarter video shows a final screen that asks people to ""please share the video now."" The second campaign also featured GIFs and a lengthy FAQ section. Here are the two videos, with their descriptions. See if you can guess which one was successful.   ""Why can’t my cooler blend DRINKS, play MUSIC, carry GEAR, and GRILL food?! Here's the perfect tool for all your tailgate & outdoor fun!""

Showing all the polish of an Apple television spot, the company played a new video detailing its so-called Campus 2 — better known as ""the spaceship"" thanks to its enormous circular footprint — for members of Cupertino's city council last week. The presentation comes ahead of a planned November 15th vote, which would be a final approval before groundbreaking can begin. Architect Norman Foster makes an appearance in the clip, who notes that Steve Jobs told him ""don't think of me as your... Tim Cook has a small reason to celebrate today, as Apple was finally given approval by the Cupertino City Council to build its new ""spaceship"" campus. ""Our home for innovation and creativity for decades to come,"" Cook says of the campus in a tweet. Apple still has a long way to go before it'll be moving in, however. Should construction go as scheduled, the new campus won't begin holding Apple employees until sometime in mid-2016.  We've seen plenty of mockups, renders, and even floor plans for Apple's proposed ""spaceship"" campus, but a new, intricately detailed model provides the best look yet at what Apple is hoping to build. The model you see above was shown to the San Jose Mercury News ahead of an October 15th Cupertino city council vote on the project. And it's a sight to behold; the model provides a genuine sense of scale for the circular campus, parking structures, and other buildings Apple plans to erect nearby... Apple will delay the construction of a secondary research and development building on its ""spaceship"" campus in an attempt to drive down the cost of developing its new headquarters. In a filing with the City of Cupertino, Apple said construction of the office building on North Tantau Avenue will now commence as part of Phase 2 of its campus development, a delay that will see work begin once its iconic spaceship building has opened in 2016. Bloomberg Businessweek is reporting that the budget for Apple's new ""spaceship"" campus has risen from $3 billion to ""nearly $5 billion."" Citing five anonymous sources, the publication notes that the stretched budget would make Apple Campus 2 more expensive than the World Trade Center complex currently under construction. The project was originally scheduled for completion in 2015, but the move-in date has now been pushed back to 2016 as architects Foster + Partners search for a way to cut the... On today's annual shareholder meeting, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that he expects the company will move into its new Cupertino Campus 2, nicknamed the ""spaceship,"" in 2016. Additionally, the CEO stated that the company is in continued talks with the city to gain approval for the project, and he said that ""we hope to break ground later this year."" The timetable provided by Tim Cook is a year later than what the company first said when it revealed plans for the campus. At that time, it said that... We've already seen a number of renders of Apple Campus 2 — the company's proposed ""spaceship"" campus — that show what it will look like from the outside. But if you're curious about the inner workings of the massive building, Apple has submitted a series of floor plans to the city of Cupertino that give an inside look. The plans show the campus and its interior from multiple angles, and you can see everything from the where the campus' security line will be placed to just how many excerise... Apple has reached out to its neighbors in Cupertino, CA with a mass mailing that details the company's ambitious plans for its upcoming ""spaceship"" campus. The letter, signed by CFO Peter Oppenheimer and obtained by 9to5Mac, lays out current plans for the research facility — now formally referred to as Apple Campus 2. Much of the content within is rehashed from an appearance the late Steve Jobs made before Cupertino's city council in June of last year. But seeing as we doubt every local... Cupertino City Council has released a new set of renders and floor plans of the forthcoming Apple campus, giving locals and fanboys a glimpse of the company's future home just a couple of miles from One Infinite Loop.

Heeding years of complaints about the tacky and unpleasant feeling of its plastic Galaxy phones, Samsung finally responded this summer with the introduction of a new metal frame on the Galaxy Alpha. Today at IFA, the Korean company has added the Note 4 and Note Edge to what’s turning into a portfolio of metal-rimmed devices. It’s described as a new design approach, but it’s being done in classic Samsung style. Samsung has been paying lip service to the importance of industrial design for a very long time. Much like its local nemesis LG, however, the Korean chaebol's message of meaningful innovation has most often devolved into the act of adding more technological complication for its own sake. Last year's overwrought Galaxy Gear was testament to this approach of unrestrained gadgetification — the assumption that more of everything will ultimately amount to the greatest possible sum. As recently as six months ago, Samsung was still pursuing the same old strategy of overwhelming with features and neglecting good design while saying it would take the Galaxy S5 ""back to basics."" It's not that the S5 lacked a memorable look, but it was memorable for all the wrong reasons. The fundamental change marked today is in the materials that Samsung uses in its phones. The perpetually fake metal that's framed Galaxy devices since the original chromed-out Galaxy S has finally become real. And the difference made by this seemingly superficial change is enormous. I've yet to hold the Galaxy Alpha in my hands, but handling the new Note devices conveys a sense of legitimate design cohesion. Front and back are brought together into a harmonious and satisfyingly rigid whole. The Note's power button is perfectly tactile and responsive, without even a hint of squishiness. The chamfered edges just feel right. In an age when people are spending more time with their phones than any other device (or even person), mediocre design is no longer acceptable. Smartphone manufacturers are responsible for building things that people have profound and intimate relationships with. Nobody wants to wake up next to a plasticky slab of unfriendly technology. Samsung's always known that, but it's only now taking the critical step of deploying better materials in the pursuit of better design. The outcome, in the shape of these first few devices, has been a clear success. As delightful and tangible as the upgrade may be for the user of Samsung's new metal Galaxies, the move actually represents a continuation of what the company has been doing all along. Though hampered by its software and a number of questionable design decisions, the Galaxy Gear did use stainless steel in its construction and was built to last. This year saw the introduction of the beautiful Gear Fit and the present debut of the Gear S alongside the IFA-headlining Notes. Samsung has been using better materials and sculpting desirable devices already — it's just bringing that same expertise to bear on its all-important smartphone portfolio. Samsung's also doing a better job of capitalizing on its technological leadership by using curved AMOLED displays on its smartwatches that make them instant lightning rods for attention. The same display technology is used in the Note 4, which goes up to Quad HD resolution to match LG's G3 and a few other phones that already offer it. So no, Samsung isn't going to stop competing in the spec race anytime soon, but the way it's using its assets and resources is smarter. It may surprise you to find that Samsung's cheap-feeling plastic has never actually been all that cheap. The switch to metal framing is therefore unlikely to drastically increase the cost of manufacturing Samsung's new phones, though it makes for an obvious improvement in their appeal and usability. The best part about it all is that Samsung seems committed to pursuing this new design direction. The company knows that the only way it can survive the assault from China's upstart phone makers is by producing something they are not capable or willing to match. With specs losing their luster as a main selling point and Samsung continually failing to differentiate itself through software, it was time to look elsewhere for some way to stand out. Samsung's still not producing masterpieces of modern technological art, but the things it's building now are more attractive and tactile than they've ever been before.",0.5287423099101145,0.4712576900898855,0.16223135979712833,741,5.1093117408906883,418,6.2535885167464116,0,8,"Design, Mobile, Tech, Report"

But I'm really excited about it. That's because what LG actually did last night was verify that round displays on smartwatches are real. They're ""a thing."" The Moto 360 isn't a one-trick pony, a one-off; the industry has officially figured out how to deliver round wearables, and it's going to do so on a measurable scale.  Smartwatches still just don't look that great I can't overstate how important that is. Smartwatch adoption is held back primarily by two things: one, it's hard to convince people that they need notifications on their wrist, especially when a significant percentage of consumers have simply never worn a wristwatch and don't care to start now. That's an ongoing challenge, and the ball now lies in Apple's court to see if the industry is ready and able to turn that corner. But secondly, smartwatches still just don't look that great. It's a complaint I've been lodging since before the launch of Samsung's original Galaxy Gear last year. Even the best-looking ones are compromises: the Pebble Steel, which is the consensus best-looking smartwatch currently on sale, has a square, black-and-white display as its centerpiece.   That's not to say a wrist-worn device must have a round face to look good, of course, but it can't look like a physical manifestation of high technology — it has to put fashion first, because it's always visible. You can hide a smartphone in your pocket or purse when it's not in use, but wearables have to ascribe to the same rules of design as a shirt, shoe, or hat. (Imagine how many more Google Glass would be sold if they were indistinguishable from regular sunglasses or eyeglasses.) The round face, an iconic element of the classic wristwatch, is a huge leap in that direction. Analog watch hands aren't dead But it's only a leap, not the finish line. Multiple industry sources have indicated to me that manufacturers are aggressively pursuing display technologies that would make smartwatches virtually indistinguishable from a 30-year-old Timex or Tag Heuer without sacrificing functionality. Analog watch hands aren't dead: consider a round, full-color display with hands above, or a transparent OLED with hands underneath, for instance. The technology is close, and designers are fully aware that they need to get there. And for smartwatches, that's the dream: once engineers figure out how to seamlessly walk us back to analog, they'll be able to replicate the full spectrum of designs found in traditional wristwatches. Obviously analog hands aren't for everyone, but then you'll be able to choose something more akin to a Moto 360 or G Watch R, or even a rectangular display if that's more your style. That variety is a wonderful thing. It's a celebration of form factor diversity that we've lost with smartphones in the age of the glass rectangle — but thankfully we won't have to lose it with the wearable. So, no, I'm not buying a G Watch R; the faux timing bezel just doesn't do anything for me. Nor will I buy a Samsung Gear S, for that matter. I'm just awfully glad they exist.

The service promises dishes from ""popular, iconic restaurants"" delivered curbside — not to your door — ""faster than it takes to boil water."" An Uber representative told The Verge that UberEats has its own dedicated drivers. Lunch options will range from $9 to $12, while dinner options will range from $10 to $15. The Uber rep said meals come with a $3 delivery fee ($4 in New York City), regardless of the number of meals you order. ""Faster than it takes to boil water."" In a blog post about the expansion, Uber says it plans to ""curate"" menus, which will change daily, just like any other artisanal app experience. For its inaugural run in New York City, UberEats will kick off with ""an exclusive sandwich"" from American Cut, Kale Caesar salad from Sweetgreen, the steak sandwich from Num Pang, and more. Chicago consumers can order the Pepito Torta from XOCO and Carne Asada Cemita from Cemitas, among other offerings.

Uber's first foray into ""things"" began with courier service called UberRush tested in Manhattan. Next up was Cornerstore, a delivery service for household items beta-tested in Washington, D.C. that was renamed UberEssentials. It's only natural that the company, which raised $5.9 billion in funding, doubles down on UberEats while venture capitalists are salivating hundreds of millions over food delivery. Uber claims that the response to UberEats has been ""amazingly positive."" In Los Angeles, Uber now offers brunch on the weekends and claims delivery time is down to 10 minutes or less. According to Uber, its drivers ""tell us they love having another way to earn more through the Uber platform,"" although the $40 billion company and its contract workers don't always see eye to eye. To promote its carpool offering, Uber is charging San Francisco customers only $7 to get anywhere in the city using UberPool, while drivers are compensated regularly. It's unclear what kind of incentives Uber is offering drivers for UberEats. Uber says the feedback from UberEats has been 'amazingly positive' In response to questions from The Verge about the status of of UberRush and UberEssentials, the company said that UberRush was still running out of New York City, adding: To place an UberEats order, users just slide to appropriate tab and hit ""view menu."" The idea is to make food delivery as gratuitously mindless as ordering a private driver.

Yet the tiny bacteria that could turn this brew into an acrid, undrinkable slop are lurking all around us, entirely invisible to the naked eye. These microbes are both a brewer’s best friend and worst nightmare.  I’m visiting the Russian River Brewing company, in Santa Rosa, California — about an hour north of San Francisco. To the untrained eye, the only thing that gives the warehouse away as a brewery is a large grain mill jutting out of the back and a small pile of colorful kegs. But come closer to the massive open door, and it becomes immediately clear that magic is being made here. Liquid magic.  This is a small facility, though Russian River has managed to turn out award-winning beers that have inspired a cult-like following. The brewery is best known for Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger, both of which sit in the highest of the high ratings on Beer Advocate and Ratebeer, two immensely popular beer review sites. ""I want to make babies with this beer and pick out window treatments on a Sunday while the big game is on and you know what I don't care about missing the game because I'm in love!,"" gushes one reviewer of Pliny The Elder on Beer Advocate. ""The flavor will cause the uninitiated to dial 911,"" writes another. They’re not exaggerating. Drive a few miles up the road to the company’s pub (where smaller batches of beer are also being brewed), and you’ll see a seemingly never-ending parade of people hobbling out the doors with boxes of the beer in hand. In part, that’s because the brew can be difficult to find, but also because Pliny begins losing its hoppy flavor shortly after it’s bottled. Unlike some wines and many other types of beers, the sooner you drink this one, the better it tastes. But something very simple can throw that flavor off before most types of beer are even bottled, and cause further troubles once it’s left the brewery: Pediococcus and Lactobacillus, two types of bacteria with voracious appetites that can wreak havoc by leaving an undesirable sour taste in their wake. They can be crucial to making some beer styles, but if unchecked in others (like say an India Pale Ale), they can ruin a batch. That’s why I’m here: Russian River is among the first breweries to try a new test for these germs, one that promises to take a week-long test that has become the standard among brewers, and do it in just under three hours. One of the big reasons so much testing is done is that these bacteria can be found just about everywhere if you’re brewing beer. The microbes are naturally occurring in malted barley, and can  thrive in the nooks and crannies of brewing equipment — from drain pipes and hoses, to foam that may not have been washed away. Breweries put in place numerous safeguards to keep contamination from happening. Russian River is in a rather unique situation because, alongside its hoppy beers, it’s also brewing sour beers, which are steeped with Pediococcus and Lactobacillus to produce a flavorful, funky taste. Like a Kosher kitchen, the brewery keeps the equipment completely separated from one another, so things like hoses, kegs, and even lifts are labeled with red tapes or ""funky"" warnings. Workers who have been producing one of those sour beers will even go home, take a shower, and come back later with a new pair of clothes to avoid cross-contamination. For years, the prescribed method for seeking out certain types of bacteria was a system called plating. That involves taking a very small sample of beer, then putting it onto a plate of what is basically bacteria food. The whole thing is sealed up, then put in an incubator. Breweries usually put plated samples of the same batch both in open air and in a special anaerobic chamber to simulate the oxygen-free existence of life in a bottle. Wherever the plate is, the bacteria will either grow into a colony that can very clearly be seen with the naked eye, or never appear at all. Knowing whether these bacteria are in the brew is something you just can’t do by looking at beer on its own. ""It’s not like yeast, where you can take a look at it and say ‘okay there are 10 per mil[lileter] or like a million per mil, says Mike Guilford, who runs Russian River’s quality control operations. ""Bacteria is really small, and can move around."" While accurate, plating’s biggest downside is that it takes time. And with beer, like most businesses, time is money. Breweries of all sizes are constantly juggling a fresh supply of ingredients with space on their brewery floors, where complex chemistry is happening around the clock. And when hiccups happen, it can take days to get a rhythm back. ""Every time you can turn [around] that tank, fill it up, and empty it, that’s another batch of beer you can sell,"" Guilford says. ""Anything in the line that holds that up pushes everything off. If you lose one turn, you’ll lose thousands and thousands of dollars."" To speed up turnaround time, Philadelphia-based company Invisible Sentinel has come up with a new rapid testing kit called the BrewPal that identifies isolated chunks of DNA from problem bacteria. It’s not meant to diagnose every potential problem that could threaten a good beer; rather, it’s designed to target the specific types of Pediococcus and Lactobacillus bacteria that are responsible for serious, and often irreversible damage. Invisible Sentinel is not the only game in town for beer, but it claims to have one of the smallest and most inexpensive solutions thus far. A full system costs less than $5,000, which puts it out of the range of home-brewers, though on the bottom end of these types of brewery tools. ""All the other PCR-based instruments out there are way more expensive,"" Guilford says. ""We’re talking $30- or $40,000, and they take up way more counter space, and you have to grow [bacteria] on some of them, or you have to enrich them over the course of a day or two, so we never thought of purchasing one."" Competitors include Sigma-Aldrich, whose HybriScan system promises results in 2 to 2.5 hours, and can limit its screening to only living bacteria (unlike Invisible Sentinel, whose positive includes dead bacteria). There’s also a cartridge-based testing tool from the Pall Corporation that came out in mid-2012, which plugs into a master system that can scan for other microorganisms. All these companies are trying to solve the beer spoilage problem because it’s the kind of thing that can keep beer customers, both old and new, from buying a beer again. While seasonal beers can vary based on differences in ingredients, people expect a certain beer from a brewery to taste the same every time they buy it, much like they would a dish at a chain restaurant. But bacterial infections can very easily keep that from happening. ""One of the reasons it’s such a difficult problem is that it’s so difficult to catch it, and to prevent it,"" says Adam Bartles, the director of brewing operations at Victory Brewing across the country in Philadelphia. ""These bacterias, once they start producing acid, there’s no rectification — you can’t neutralize the sourness."" That’s why brewers have long turned to early warning systems, he says. Victory Brewing, which brews approximately 100 times as much beer as Russian River does each year, has also been using the kits as part of a validation test. Basically, this means Invisible Sentinel making sure its creation works before selling it on the open market,  a process that has involved brewers continuing to run plating tests alongside the BrewPal, and comparing the results to make sure they match up. The idea behind the BrewPal is that you can simply get a yes or no for if the bacteria is there, much like an over-the-counter test for pregnancy. The test uses a polymerase chain reaction, or PCR for short. The process was developed in the early 1980s, and effectively works as a photocopier for DNA, amplifying a relatively small sample into something that can be more accurately measured. It’s been used in everything from criminal forensics and paternity tests to helping enforce overfishing tied to black caviar. Testing using the BrewPal is a fairly simple three-step process, but still requires precision, training, and several pieces of extra equipment. First, a sample of beer is collected and run through a centrifuge, sending all the bacteria and solids down to the bottom of the tube. A liquid buffer is added, then the liquid part of the sample is piped into a much smaller tube that goes into the BrewPal hardware. Then, the sample is carefully heated and cooled for about two and a half hours so that the bacteria’s DNA can be amplified. The final step involves taking the sample and dropping it into a disposable plastic reader that looks a lot like a pregnancy test. Three minutes later, you can see if you’ve got the bacteria there, or you don’t. The reading will also say whether you have a mild infection, or a very bad one. Problems with contamination aren’t limited to beer, and the widespread adoption of a similar test in wine shows the potential for BrewPal. Winemakers also use yeasts to help convert sugars into alcohol as a basic part of fermentation. But one yeast, Brettanomyces bruxellensis, which is a naturally occurring yeast that’s basically everywhere — including the skin of grapes — causes wine to spoil (it’s also used at Russian River to help make its sour beers). Kendall-Jackson, a part of one of the largest winemakers in the US, wanted to identify the yeast as early on in the process as possible, so it approached Invisible Sentinel and proposed that they try making a test, similar to the ones the company had already made for food-borne pathogens like Salmonella and Listeria, but to sniff out yeast instead. The test was a success, and now it’s being used by about 100 wineries in the US and 45 internationally in places like New Zealand and Australia. With all this in mind, it’s important to note that beer is not a totally fragile product; it’s one of the oldest and most successful beverages in history. It has alcohol, hop compounds, and a low pH, all of which help to suppress organisms from setting up shop in the first place. And the prevalence of modern-day refrigeration — both in transit and in stores — reduces the risk even of a contaminated beer spoiling, since bacterial growth is slowed to a crawl. Even with these advantages though, beer can simply break down over time, no matter how well you make it, Guilford says. Certain types of beer like Pliny, start tasting bad just a few months after bottling, thanks to non-bacteria-related ingredients like oxygen and metals that begin to give the beer a sweet and eventual ""cardboardy"" taste. Later, at the brewpub, I sat outside — hovering over a pint of Pliny the Elder and avoiding raindrops. Inside, the bar was completely packed, including a small line of beer tourists who were just there to buy beer to take home. As I stared into the bubbles, I thought about all the batches that had been thrown out, the soured brews that never made it past quality control into any customer's mouth. It seemed like a waste — of water, of time, of beer — and it wasn't hard to understand why Guilford wanted to minimize it. After all, the point of a craft beer brewery is to make beer people enjoy.",0.5082726503025927,0.4917273496974073,0.8565306331149346,2002,4.8096903096903096,925,6.2670270270270274,0,9,"Business, Science, Tech, Report"

That’s a tough act to follow, yet somehow Apple still managed to outdo everyone’s expectations (including its own) for its past three months of sales, thanks once again to the iPhone. Apple today posted earnings of $13.6 billion on $58 billion in revenue, above both what it forecast and what investors were expecting. iPad sales were not great For the three months ending in March, Apple sold 61.2 million iPhones, 12.6 million iPads, and 4.5 million Macs. All told, its gross margin for everything was 40.8 percent, which came in well above the 38.5 and 39.5 percent Apple expected. ""We are thrilled by the continued strength of iPhone, Mac and the App Store, which drove our best March quarter results ever,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement alongside the results. ""We’re seeing a higher rate of people switching to iPhone than we’ve experienced in previous cycles, and we’re off to an exciting start to the June quarter with the launch of Apple Watch.""  Apple’s revenue came in way beyond estimates. Apple expected revenue somewhere between $52 billion and $55 billion, while Wall Street was looking for $56.06 billion according to 36 analysts polled by Yahoo Finance. For its June quarter, Apple says to anticipate revenue between $46 billion and $48 billion, which is on the higher end of the $44 to $47 billion analysts expected.  Apple Watch sales don't count until next quarter Even with the big iPhone sales surprise, this quarter's phone sales still fell below the 74.5 million phones people bought during the last quarter. Analyst firms like Bernstein Research were expecting Apple to sell 59.6 million iPhones, while a general consensus was that Apple would sell a lower 56.8 million. Apple says it more than doubled sales in places like Korea, Singapore, and Vietnam. It also saw 80 percent sales increases in Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Turkey. There was equal surprise for the iPad, but not in a good way. Its sales slumped again at 12.6 million units, down big from the 21.4 million Apple sold last quarter and well under the 14.1 million that were expected. Apple’s attempted to temper expectations for the iPad in the past several quarters, with Cook urging patience of the tablet as a category. More recently, the company’s been highlighting things like customer satisfaction and business users planning to buy the tablets as reasons not to worry that sales are sliding. ""It is what it is. It will play out, and at some point it will stabilize,"" Cook told analysts when asked about the lackluster iPad sales. ""I am not sure precisely when, but I’m pretty confident it will."" Apple’s attempted to temper expectations for the iPad  Apple's Mac numbers were down quarter over quarter, but it's a hard comparison from the 5.52 million computers the company sold during the last quarter. But at 4.5 million, it's up some from the 4.1 million it sold during the same quarter a year ago, and managed to outperform the iPad in terms of revenue. Notably, this quarter do not include sales of Apple’s newest MacBook, which only began shipping to customers earlier this month. Once again, Apple found its growth from Greater China, which was the only region to actually grow its sales back-to-back from the company's monster quarter. Its sales were up 4 percent sequentially, which is quite a feat considering Apple saw a 157 percent jump there in the quarter before. The company’s aggressively been trying to tap into sales there, opening up six new stores there during the quarter, with plans to bolster its footprint there to 40 retail stores by the middle of next year. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal late last year, Cook said to expect China to account for most of Apple’s revenue, adding that it was ""just a matter of time."" For this quarter, at least, Greater China made up $16.8 billion of Apple's $58 billion in sales.  Apple’s next quarter will be the first to include sales of the Apple Watch, but don’t expect the company to reveal any numbers. The watch, along with sales of the iPod, Apple TV, and Beats accessories are all lumped into a catch-all category called ""other products."" That could  obviously change if Apple Watch sales take off enough to eclipse other product categories. Last year, Cook said the company also wanted to keep the numbers close to its chest for competitive reasons. Along with the results, Apple announced plans to expand its stock buyback program to $200 billion through the end of March 2017. That ends up working out to $140 billion from the $90 billion the company said it would spend last year.",0.5157016162414982,0.48429838375850176,0.4996058258237328,816,4.8590686274509807,415,5.6891566265060245,0,2,"Apple, Business, Tech, Breaking"

Then bad things happen, like lawsuits, lots of wasted effort, and generally bad karma. Rarely does this provide any meaningful benefit to the original patent owner."" ""We view this as an experiment."" Like many things Google does, this project is a sort of open beta. ""We view this as an experiment,"" Google wrote in the program's FAQ. ""We are looking for ways to help improve the patent landscape, and we hope that by removing some of the friction that exists in the secondary market for patents, this program might yield better, more immediate results for patent owners versus partnering with non­-practicing entities."" Lo doesn't offer any assurances in the post that Google would not use these patents for litigation in the future. And the program makes no effort to open the marketplace to other like-minded tech companies, something that would benefit the entire ecosystem. Google is basically asking patent owners to trust them. The company has pledged in the past to only use its patents defensively, suing only if someone sues it first. Of course, a company's stance on patents can shift over time as it moves from young disrupters to entrenched incumbents. 2015 could also be the year Congress takes action.

Those figures show Twitter suffering a big miss on revenue, bringing in $436 million versus the expected $456. The company says part of that was due to the acquisition of a marketing technology company, TellApart. The company lost $162 million, compared with $132 million for this period last year. It also lowered its revenue projections, trimming next quarter to $470-$485 million, well below expectations for revenue of $538.1 million, as compiled by Bloomberg. There was some positive data in the earnings. Twitter fell short of its mobile monthly active users target. But the overall total of monthly active users was in line with expectations at 302 million, marking the first time Twitter has surpassed the 300 million mark. That's a rise of 18 percent over last year and up from 288 million last quarter.  Selerity is a data mining firm that has pulled this kind of prank before. According to Forbes the firm ""crawls URLs that closely match those that corporate investor relations departments have previously used to publish quarterly results...In January 2011, Selerity found Microsoft's results more than an hour before the market close.""

The company says it's about giving consumers the choice they crave, and it's clear Verizon feels it needs this kind of customization to compete with the broadening array of streaming video options. But ESPN publicly objected to the plan, and today the sports media giant is reportedly suing Verizon for breach of contract. ""Among other issues, our contracts clearly provide that neither ESPN nor ESPN2 may be distributed in a separate sports package,"" the company said. Verizon wanted to offer those channels as part of a $10 ""sports pack"" that consumers could bolt onto their base subscription. ""ESPN is at the forefront of embracing innovative ways to deliver high-quality content and value to consumers on multiple platforms, but that must be done in compliance with our agreements. We simply ask that Verizon abide by the terms of our contracts,"" ESPN said in a statement. ESPN is far and away the most expensive channel when calculating what subscribers pay per channel, because its lock on various sporting content puts it in very high demand. Disney has no incentive to unbundle it from their other channels. To get ESPN you also need to subsidize ABC, A&E, and History. Verizon is in the enviable position of having ESPN take the blame from angry consumers if things don't work out. It's clearly playing up that angle with its public statements.

""It’s all about consumer choice. I mean, if you look at the TV bundles today, most people only on average watch 17 channels. So this a way to give consumers what they want on a choice basis."" This current scrap is part of a much bigger change happening in the pay-TV industry. As the subscriber base shrinks and viewing shifts to streaming media on demand, ratings are sinking even at top channels like ESPN.

It's a notable increase from the 43.7 million iPhones it sold in the same quarter last year, and beat analysts' estimates which hovered around 56 million iPhones sold, according to Fortune.

People have continued to purchase the iPhone in droves, but as usual, Apple didn't break down sales numbers for each iPhone. The tremendous and continued growth of the iPhone exemplifies how difficult it will be for Apple — or any company — to replicate its success.

That means marriage equality has come to all 50 states, including the 13 states where same-sex marriage is illegal. There is a right to marriage equality!  Today's ruling covers four cases from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee, in which the courts in each respective state asked to uphold marriage bans. In the Supreme Court's opinion, Justice Kennedy writes that the history of marriage is one of ""continuity and change"" and that the times have changed to meet the needs of gays and lesbians in the country. Marriage between straight couples doesn't differ from marriage between same-sex couples, so upholding laws that discriminate against them is unlawful: No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the SixthCircuit is reversed. It is so ordered. President Obama took to Twitter swiftly to respond to the watershed decision: Today is a big step in our march toward equality. Gay and lesbian couples now have the right to marry, just like anyone else. #LoveWins  However, the dissenting opinions in today's ruling were given plenty to room to air their grievances. Chief Justice Roberts, as well as Justices Thomas, Alito, and Scalia all argued that the ruling was unconstitutional, and that the power to lift marriage bans should be left with the states. Scalia even went out of his way to state that who people choose to marry doesn't even matter to him, but the debate concerning how marriage should function in America today should be allowed to continue without the Supreme Court's interference. Despite dissenting opinions, this was inevitable While the debate may continue as states like Kentucky briefly resist today's ruling, there's no question that the Supreme Court's decision finally brings about the sweeping change activists have demanded for decades, and that most of America has come around to in recent years.",0.8895925208362777,0.11040747916372229,0.8501509211641634,441,5.0589569160997732,266,5.9849624060150379,1,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Breaking"

The case began when the warehouse, run by Atlas Logistics Group, began finding piles of excrement in the public workspace, and was forced to investigate who might be behind the string of mysterious crappings. Based on the scene of the crime, the company suspected an inside job, but it had no firm evidence aside from the poop itself. That's where Atlas got into trouble. Supervisors forced two workers, named Dennis Reynolds and Jack Lowe, to submit to cheek swabbing, comparing their DNA to the DNA found in the poop. Both men were exonerated by the test, but it raised the thorny question of whether Atlas had the right to demand a test in the first place. Ultimately, the court ruled that the company had overstepped, and awarded Reynolds and Lowe $2.2 million, including nearly $1.75 million in punitive damages. Atlas has vowed to appeal the ruling and pare down the final sum.

The Federal Communications Commission doesn't plan on giving T-Mobile the extra help that it's been looking for in the upcoming spectrum auction, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said today. T-Mobile, Sprint, Dish, and other small carriers have been pushing for the FCC to set aside more spectrum for them to bid on that would be safe from AT&T and Verizon — two giants that could easily outspend all of them. The Justice Department even sent a letter to the commission this week suggesting that it take T-Mobile's request into heavy consideration. The commission may have done that, but its answer is still ""no.""  30MHz hits the balance the FCC is looking for, Wheeler says Even though T-Mobile may not be getting everything it wanted, the situation isn't a complete loss. The spectrum being set aside for it to bid may be as large as 30MHz, and T-Mobile really only wanted to see it raised up to 40MHz. That means there's still a significant portion of spectrum that these smaller carriers can bid on and win at lower prices. ""The draft order concludes that the current reserve size of 30 megahertz balances the desire to make low-band spectrum available to parties with limited holdings while facilitating competitive bidding for all auction participants,"" Wheeler writes in a blog post. The situation is hugely important to T-Mobile and these other carriers because this is the last chance that they're going to have for, possibly, decades to bid on spectrum that's just this good. The upcoming auction, scheduled for the first quarter of next year, will give carriers — and would-be carriers like Dish — the chance to acquire 600MHz spectrum, which travels long distances and has good penetration inside of buildings. It's a way for these companies to make their cell networks a lot more capable, so any advantage they can get to acquire more of it is a huge win.

The allegations regarding Dre's behavior have bubbled up in the wake of both a successful new album, Compton — his first in 16 years — and the N.W.A biopic Straight Outta Compton, which chronicles Dre's rise to fame alongside contemporaries like Ice Cube and Eazy-E. Straight Outta Compton ignores Dre's abusive history, and the omission has triggered both a new level of scrutiny regarding Dre's behavior and the resulting widespread condemnation. ""Twenty-five years ago I was a young man drinking too much and in over my head with no real structure in my life,"" said Dre. ""However, none of this is an excuse for what I did. I’ve been married for 19 years and every day I’m working to be a better man for my family, seeking guidance along the way. I’m doing everything I can so I never resemble that man again.

""Dre has apologized for the mistakes he’s made in the past and he’s said that he’s not the same person that he was 25 years ago,"" said Apple. ""We believe his sincerity and after working with him for a year and a half, we have every reason to believe that he has changed."" The uproar over Dre's behavior was sparked by a late July Gawker essay titled ""Remember When Dr. Dre Bashed a Female Journalist’s Face Against a Wall?"" The essay detailed Dre's 1991 attack on journalist Denise ""Dee"" Barnes, an assault that was ostensibly retribution for an inflammatory TV segment Barnes aired in late 1990. (The story was reported on by major media at the time and Dre was charged, but it had otherwise been mostly stricken from the public record.) A few weeks later, Barnes wrote her own essay for Gawker, this one titled ""Here's What's Missing From Straight Outta Compton: Me and the Other Women Dr. Dre Beat Up."" Barnes wrote about her own assault at Dre's hands and his abuse of one-time girlfriend Michel'le and labelmate Tairrie B. Gawker affiliate Jezebel then revealed that Straight Outta Compton had originally contained a scene depicting Dre's attack on Barnes, one that was cut from its script during production. ""I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life"" - Dr. Dre Dre's comments to The New York Times weren't his first attempt to address his abusive history. In a cover story interview with Rolling Stone published between Gawker's first essay and Barnes' follow-up, Dre was asked about the pattern of abuse. ""I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life,"" said Dre. ""I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations aren't true – some of them are.

In her review for The Verge, Emily Yoshida called it ""perfect, narrative-free pop music""; almost everyone agrees that it's a thoroughly intelligent and mature record, a revitalization few people would've predicted when ""Call Me Maybe"" seemed destined for one-hit wonder immortality. I'm excited that everyone's in love with E•MO•TION because I think it's a great album, too, but I've noticed something about its coverage: almost everyone treats Jepsen's career as having started with ""Call Me Maybe"" back in 2012. It's a juicy prong for any sort of piece, and if Jepsen has anything approaching a ""narrative"" it's the accepted first chapter, but it's not the story's real beginning. Some reviews might mention Jepsen's stint on Canada's version of American Idol — which is called Canadian Idol, naturally — in passing, but that's about it. I want to introduce you to Jepsen's first perfect song, a sparkling adult contemporary jam that dominated my mom's van and kitchen radio in 2008 and 2009 before the first note of ""Call Me Maybe"" hit the page. Let's listen to ""Tug of War.""   After finishing third on the fifth season of Canadian Idol in 2007 — curse you, Brian Melo! — Jepsen decamped to her British Columbia home to write and record demos in the hopes of securing a record deal. It worked: she signed with independent label MapleMusic in early 2008 and started working on her debut album. Tug of War came out that September, and it didn't exactly set the Canadian charts on fire: according to a 2012 Billboard cover story, it just scraped over 10,000 copies sold. But it was a genial, capable collection of folk-pop songs about young love and loss, and Jepsen sung with delicacy and emotional savvy the same way she does now. (She wrote or co-wrote every song on the record save one John Denver cover.) Canadian radio programmers bludgeoned their listeners with ""Tug of War"" The single ""Tug of War"" succeeded where the album failed, peaking at no. 32 on the Canadian charts and eventually going gold. I can tell you from personal experience that it felt like a much bigger hit. I was growing up in a small town without terrestrial Top 40 radio when ""Tug of War"" came out, so I spent a lot of time listening to our local adult contemporary station. It treated ""Tug of War"" the way radio stations in 2015 treat ""Trap Queen"" or ""Cheerleader"": play it early and often, and bludgeon your listeners into submission. One part of this strategy has to do with government regulations, if you can believe it. Under the Broadcasting Act of Canada and the watchful eye of the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), Canadian terrestrial radio stations have to play anywhere between 25 and 40 percent Canadian music. It's a measure that's supposed to help preserve Canadian culture and promote our young and rising artists. So when one of those artists — like Carly Rae c. 2008 — manages to put together a quality single, it's in stations' best interests to play it as much as possible. Jepsen's been writing about adult behavior for almost a decade now That was fine with me, because ""Tug of War"" was (and remains) wonderful. It has many of the same qualities that are earning Jepsen plaudits for E•MO•TION, albeit wrapped in less fashionable packaging: a lovely melody, a tender and weightless vocal take, a surprising frankness and maturity when it comes to romance. ""Don't go out with the boys tonight / I won't sleep a wink / wonder what you're doin',"" sings Jepsen. ""Don't go out with the girls tonight / I will turn to drink / Wonderin' who you're screwin'."" This is why criticism that infantilizes Jepsen or the work she did on Kiss drives me up the wall — she's been writing and singing about adult behavior for almost a decade now. E•MO•TION is going to make the perfect late summer soundtrack for many people who would've been hesitant to give Jepsen the time of day three years ago. I'm glad they're going to be won over, but I hope they manage to find their way to ""Tug of War"" somehow. It'll give them one more Jepsen jam they find themselves surprised to love.",0.8566832969190772,0.1433167030809228,0.6285438994244322,743,4.7981157469717362,422,5.7630331753554502,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Music"

She's talked about her relationship with an unnamed record executive who was the ""love of her life,"" going to rehab at the age of 14, and living in a New Jersey trailer park during an early stage of her career. The world of Lana Del Rey is one of sex, drugs and Americana, and at a certain point the universe she has constructed in her prolific output was no longer reliant on ""the real Elizabeth Grant,"" and became its own towering, novelistic body of work. Part of that proliferation is due to a steady stream of leaked unreleased songs that made their way to the internet in 2012 and 2013, fans became privy to many songs that were clearly precursors or studies for later official album cuts. But even in her officially sanctioned material there are ideas that she keeps returning to, little fixations and favorite phrases that make her heightened world all the more personal. You can see YouTube commenters getting their minds blown when they find these connections; these small revelations and puzzle pieces are so much of the pull of her music. Like any queen inspiring the love and devotion of millions, she has gone by many names: Lana Rey Del Mar, Lizzie Grant, May Jailer, Sparkle Jump Rope Queen. But the 100+ plus songs and lyrics below belong to one diamond-like mind. How to use the chart: zoom in by scrolling up.

I'm Jamieson, I'm still your host, and I hope you've all enjoyed reading the site during this year's Hack Week! This post isn't going to change too much, but I'm going to close out my own personal Hack Week with one bonus feature: a tricky Most Important Songs of the Week quiz. It's embedded below all of this week's write-ups, and I'd love to hear what you thought (and how you did!) in the comments. As per usual, there's a Spotify playlist at the end for your listening convenience, and you're also welcome to share your own favorite cuts, comments, and complaints. Let's go: Beirut, ""Gibraltar"":   ""Gibraltar"" is the second song released from No No No, Beirut's upcoming fourth full-length. Bandleader Zach Condon recorded the album in the wake of a divorce and major breakdown, the kind of circumstances that might lead you to expect something a little more somber. You won't find it here: ""Gibraltar"" is all bright piano melody and beach-bound percussion, and it's a little bit sunnier than similar songs on 2011's The Rip Tide. I loved that album, which remains a beacon of simplicity and emotional frankness — and I'm hoping that No No No can meet the lofty bar it set. Deafheaven, ""Brought to the Water"":   If ""Gibraltar"" is the sound of a bittersweet beach visit in early autumn, then listening to ""Brought to the Water"" is like being forcibly dragged and dangled over the edge of a seaside cliff on a stormy day. It's the first single from Deafheaven's upcoming New Bermuda, their follow-up to 2013's feted folk-metal-shoegaze odyssey Sunbather, and it's a woolly beast. Throat-shedding shrieking, heavy-handed riffage, insane volume and density: it's all par for the course here. I know it's a big ask, but make sure to listen all the way through to roughly 7:40 — you're in for a lovely surprise. Deerhunter, ""Snakeskin"":   Deerhunter might be the best American rock band of the last decade, and I'm thrilled to have them back. ""Snakeskin"" is the first single from their seventh studio album, Fading Frontier, and it doesn't sound like any song they've made before; it's funky, sexy, and catchy without throwing any of the band's usual wrenches. It's tough to embrace melody and directness without mortgaging the qualities that define you — in Deerhunter's case, that's a sense of queerness and alienation that pervades all of their work — but I think the band's managed it with ""Snakeskin."" The video's worthy, too, if only for frontman Bradford Cox's incredible overalls and a star turn from his dog Faulkner. Dungen, ""Franks Kaktus"":   Proggy Swedish forest spirits Dungen are releasing their first album in half a decade, Allas Sak, on September 25th. ""Franks Kaktus"" could've been just another piece of psychedelic, woodsy frippery, but the band must've given Ron Burgundy carte blanche to stampede all over the song with a jazz flute like it's just another night at Tino's. It's absurd, silly, and strangely exciting. More jazz flute, please! FKA twigs, ""in time"":   This is the finest piece of music included in twigs' new EP / conceptual video piece M3LL155X, an alien, mutating hunk of R&B that's also a thoughtful reflection on fighting to keep a relationship vital. twigs sounds more direct and biting here than on anything on LP1, radiating anger and frustration and fatigue over the connection she's trying to maintain. There aren't many artists working who can flit back and forth between the avant-garde and the mainstream with this kind of deftness. Grace Potter, ""Your Girl"":   I can't get enough of this highlight from Potter's new solo record, Midnight — it's basically a pop-soul version of Robyn's ""Call Your Girlfriend,"" albeit one with the slightest dash of ""I Kissed a Girl"" or ""Cool for the Summer."" But while Robyn was just trying to help her lover let his old girlfriend down easy, Potter can't get her out of her brain. She's a powerful, magnetic vocalist, and this is a worthy showcase for her considerable pipes. Låpsley, ""Hurt Me"":   This is a pretty standard piece of downcast electro-pop, but it's elevated to another level by Låpsley's vocal performance. Her voice is deeper and richer than I thought it was going to be — there are a lot of vocalists who would choose to float over an arrangement like this, but she gets right in the mud and leans on the heartbreak. It's a smart choice, one that sets her apart from the hordes of young musicians making similar music. Nick Jonas, ""Levels"":   If you thought Nick Jonas was primed for a disappearing act after ""Jealous"" broke last year, I have news for you: he's not going anywhere if he keeps releasing songs this good. I described this to a few co-workers as ""Robin Thicke meets 'Can't Feel My Face' meets 'You Oughta Know,'"" and I'll stand by that: listen for the fraternal hollering, the thudding low end, the melody that has to be cribbed from Alanis. (I wonder if she'll ask for a credit?) This might be blasphemy to some of you, but I'd take this over Avicii's ""Levels"" in a millisecond. ODESZA feat. Little Dragon, ""Light"":   I haven't listened to much ODESZA, but I like this song a lot — the light in question is ambient rather than star-based, the kind you see when you look up at the night sky in the city, an orange-pink-grey soup. Little Dragon's Yukimi Nagano is one of my favorite working guest vocalists: she's distinctive without being overpowering, and she can adapt without losing her character. This is another winning turn. Panda Bear, ""No Mans Land"":   Panda Bear surprise released his Crosswords EP earlier this week, a short follow-up to this year's full-length Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper. It's not much of a change from the music contained within the latter, and that's just fine; I get the feeling he could churn out playful little slices of psych-pop in his sleep at this point. ""No Mans Land"" is another cocktail of dubby rhythm, thick vocal harmony, and nearly indecipherable lyrics; if I close my eyes I can see the beaches and sunsets of Panda's adopted Portuguese home. It has that kind of simple, easy beauty. Here's this week's playlist:   And here's the quiz I mentioned above. Best of luck, and have an awesome weekend!

Learn more. I have never seen the show Bones, but at some point during The Verge's Hack Week we all got talking about Fox's decade-spanning drama. Specifically we were talking about how there's a character on the show whose nickname is Bones, and that the show is about to begin its 11th season this fall. So of course this got me thinking: ""How often do the characters on Bones say the word ""bones,"" and in what ways do they use it?"" The following is a hand-crafted statistical analysis of how — and how often — the two main characters of Bones use the word ""bones.""   I made the chart by searching for usages of the word in the ""scripts"" of every episode of Bones. I hesitate with the word ""scripts"" because these were not official scripts — rather, they were fan-written. (I spot-checked a few and they are, for the most part, pretty accurate.) As you can see, Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) dominates the usage of the word ""bones"" across the entire series — he accounts for 1,867 of the 2,668 total mentions — and almost exclusively uses it to address the character Bones (Emily Deschanel). The few times each season he uses the noun to speak about actual bones all tend to come in one episode, where he gets caught in conversations that practically require him to talk about bones (something he seems wont to do), or when he's telling Bones to go back to examining bones. In fact, he's basically the only character who calls her ""Bones"" (it is his nickname for her, I guess) except for a handful of instances. Bones herself basically only says the name ""Bones"" in this context: ""Stop calling me Bones!"" Looking at the data in another way, you can see how the frequency changes over the seasons. It peaks in seasons one and four, and trends lower and lower as the series progresses: Some caveats. For one, manually searching through every script of every episode of Bones was a dizzying affair, so while I stand by the results, I am not willing to bet my life on the exact numbers. What made this problem worse was that, for some inexplicable reason, the ""scripts"" from seasons six through 10 only sparingly told you who was saying what at any given time. This meant I had to use my powers of deductive reasoning to figure out who was speaking with each mention of ""bones."" (Luckily, by the sixth season of scripts, I had gotten a hang of the patterns. Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan rarely mentions her own nickname — mostly because she hates it — and is always the one talking about how the bones need to be cleaned.) I would give the numbers you see a margin of error of +/- 5 for each season's worth of data. Also, I originally planned to include more individual characters. (Zack Addy, the nerdy assistant to Bones who disappears from the show's plot after a few seasons, very strictly uses the noun and never refers to her as Bones. Bless his heart.) [Ed. Note: I have just been informed by Ross Miller that Zack Addy apparently became some sort of serial cannibalist and I totally didn't realize this.] They wound up being too varied, however, and their individual numbers paled in comparison to the likes of the main characters Booth and Brennan. A few things I learned from this:  ",0.32097154496836344,0.6790284550316366,0.6035498022267322,645,4.5689922480620151,357,5.5434173669467786,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Verge Hack Week 2015"

According to a New York Times report, Apple received a court order from the Justice Department this summer, demanding real-time access to a suspect's iMessage account. Apple replied that iMessage encryption made the request impossible. The company later handed over iCloud backups of the suspect's messaging history, but the request for real-time access (akin to a traditional wiretap) remained unfulfilled. There are still a number of unanswered questions around the report. We don't know the nature of the court order or the justification for Apple's refusal, so it's difficult to assess the legality of either one. Still, federal agencies have been trying and failing to wiretap iMessage accounts for years now, so the central facts of the story are very plausible. In its most recent transparency report, Apple reported more than 250 national security requests, and said 6 percent of law enforcement requests pertained to user account data.  But while Apple says iMessage can't be wiretapped, there's reason to think the company could give feds real-time access if it wanted to. As Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, has pointed out previously, Apple centrally manages all the keys for iMessage, and there's no cryptographical measure preventing the company from swapping out keys manually. As a result, many researchers describe iMessage as ""backdoor-friendly,"" if not as easily wiretapped as more conventional texting channels.",0.446867639555259,0.553132360444741,0.1741345786401822,262,5.4160305343511448,179,6.1173184357541901,0,0,"Apple, Tech"

Before today, the plan was to simply switch off Rosetta's power this coming December and let it orbit the comet indefinitely. The ESA still has to decide Rosetta's ultimate fate. A few weeks ago the scientists in charge of Rosetta announced they want to crash the spacecraft into Comet 67P at the end of the mission — an idea that is not as brute as it seems. By doing this, Rosetta's cameras and instruments could return increasingly detailed results before impact. The spacecraft is also working with a limited fuel supply and will be racing away from the Sun (which powers the electronics) by then, so crashing it into the comet may just be the most efficient way to spend the rest of its mission. Rosetta has been one of the most fun space missions to follow Rosetta has been one of the most fun space missions to follow over the last year. In August of 2014 it completed an epic 10-year journey to Comet 67P / Churyumov–Gerasimenko some 300 million miles away. But crisis hit when it deployed the Philae lander in November to study the comet's surface. As the lander descended, the harpoons meant to anchor the craft to the comet malfunctioned. Philae skipped across the surface and eventually came to rest in a dark crevice — a bad spot for a spacecraft that runs on solar power.   Philae sent back a surprising amount of data, but with little power it quickly slipped into a deep sleep. Worse, the Rosetta scientists lost sight of the lander, and only recently found promising evidence of its location on the comet. In the meantime, Rosetta took some stunning photographs of Comet 67P. It also taught us a lot about the strange, icy bodies in our outer solar system, and even provided evidence against the theory that Earth's water originally came from comets. Then, this month, Philae re-established contact. The Rosetta team received 300 data packets from the lander and also found 8,000 others stored in its memory banks, which means it collected more data at some point during its presumed hibernation. After today's news, Rosetta has much more time to pry that data from the lander.",0.4973411561021396,0.5026588438978604,0.8570403893434776,388,4.7731958762886597,238,5.5504201680672267,0,2,Science

Scientists have studied the thumb-sized worm for more than 50 years now, and have only just discovered which end is the head. A new model for the creature includes a ring of teeth around its mouth, a simple pair of eyes, and a foregut lined with tiny little teeth. The discovery means that Hallucigenia not only makes sense now — it’s also way scarier than we thought.   In 1977, British paleontologist Simon Conway-Morris came across a very weird-looking fossil. It had been found in the Burgess Shale, in the Canadian Rockies, 66 years prior. And the people who found the 0.5-inch long fossil had classified it as an annelid worm — worms that include leeches and earthworms. But when Conway-Morris took a look at it, he begged to differ. As far as he was concerned, this organism had walked on seven pairs of stilt-like spines, all while waving around the seven wacky tentacles on its back. Conway called it Hallucigenia — since it seemed like something a person might dream up during a trip gone wrong Ramskold, 1992 Conway-Morris’ model was controversial, but it stood until 1991. That year, researchers Lars Ramskold and Hou Xianguang discovered fossils in China belonging to a related animal called Microdictyon — fossils that made Conway-Morris’ mistake quite clear. These animals sported plates instead of spines on their back, which made it easy to identify their ""tentacles"" for what they truly were: legs. Conway-Morris had been looking at Hallucigenia upside-down the whole time. So, the scientists flipped it. One mystery remained, however. Which end housed Hallucigenia’s head? Conway-Morris figured it was the blob-like structure located at one end of the Burgess Shale fossil. But in 1992,  Ramskold suggested that the blob might just be a stain that was made when Hallucigenia died; the stain was created when ""decay fluids"" seeped out of the animal upon its death. Beyond this suggestion, however, it was hard to definitely tell which end of the animal was which — until now, that is.  Hallucigenia sparsa from the Burgess Shale. Credit: Jean-Bernard Caron ""When we put it in the electron microscope, we saw not just the pair of eyes, but also this big smile of teeth grinning back at us — and that really resolved for all of us not just the position of the head, but all of the detail in that as well,"" explains Martin Smith, a paleontologist at the University of Cambridge and a co-author of the new Hallucigenia study, published in Nature today. Based on their analyses, Hallucigenia not only sported long spines on its back — spines that were probably used for defense, Smith says — but teeth around its mouth, a pair of simple eyes, and teeth inside the throat-like area of its gut, to aid in digestion. The scientists now also have a much better idea of how its limbs and spines were constructed. ""Not just the pair of eyes, but also this big smile of teeth grinning back at us."" Because of these newly identified features, it’s now possible to imagine how Hallucigenia interacted with the aquatic world surrounding it, 508 million years ago. ""It wouldn’t have had clear vision,"" Smith says. Hallucigenia lived deep underwater, where light is scarce. It was probably about to make out organisms swimming overheard, and their shadows. ""It would have been able to tell day from night,"" Smith says. Scientists don’t know what Hallucigenia ate, but the mouthparts hint at a kind of suction mechanism. ""The ring of teeth around the mouth were probably involved in sucking water and food into the gut,"" Smith says, adding that the teeth inside the ""throat"" area would have kept the food from moving backwards. ""It just sucked whatever it could; it wasn’t chewing stuff."" As for its floppy legs, it’s entirely possible that they were too flimsy to really help Hallucigenia ""walk,"" Smith says. ""You can imagine him hugging or clinging onto a sponge or a seaweed or something like that, and climbing up the sponge and feeding on that."" While it clung to sponges, its spines provided some protection. ""There were probably some quite nasty predators swimming around,"" Smith says. Scientists have discovered fossils of predators such as squids and ""lobsters crossed with can openers"" that were ""really sort of bizarre and quite fearsome,"" Smith says. Predators that went after Hallucigenia may have received a nice stabbing in return. Hallucigenia wears its name well; it’s a floppy hallucination and a complete blast from the past. But the physical features described in Nature today represent a lot more for biologists than you might expect. They can be used to clear up some pretty big questions regarding the evolution of ""Ecdysozoa"" — ""one of the most large and diverse animal groups on the planet,"" Smith says. Prior to this discovery, similar genes and the ability to molt were the only features that united animals like hookworms, tartigrades, and spiders. Now, it looks like the plates around Hallucigenia’s mouth — teeth that are featured in some worms — and the teeth lining its gut, which appear in some crustaceans, can also be used to link the three. ""What Hallucigenia has shown us is a physical, anatomical feature that unites this entire group,"" Smith says. Certain subgroups simply lost these features as time went on. ""This major discovery is what makes it a really significant paper,"" says Peter van Roy, a paleontologist at Yale University who didn’t take part in the Hallucigenia study. ""It shows that these circular oral plates is a character of Ecdysozoa, in general."" In short, they didn’t pop up independently. These features would have been present in the last common ancestor, as well. Advances in microscope technology made this new model possible, Smith explains. To reach this model, Smith and his colleague, Jean-Bernard Caron, observed more than 100 Hallucigenia fossils unearthed in national parks, using electron microscopes. Electron microscopes use beams of electrons to illuminate a specimen. A few years ago, using one would have meant spraying irreplaceable fossils with gold particles that can conduct electrons, Smith says. ""That wouldn't have gone down particularly well."" Today, paleontologists can use a very fine mist of water instead. ""You don’t have to damage fossils at all,"" Smith says. But if advances in technology are the main reasons this model was created, what’s stopping even better microscopy techniques — or better fossils, for that matter — from coming along and turning this into yet another butt-to-face fiasco? ""I'm pretty confident that this is what the animal looked like."" ""Our knowledge will always improve, and no doubt there will be small adjustments, but I'm pretty confident that this is what the animal looked like,"" Van Roy says. The researcher has access to a lot more data than previous groups did, and ""our knowledge has been developing since the 1990s,"" he says. Hallucigenia, in its current form, ""makes sense."" ""In terms of its actual biology, we still know a lot less about them than we would if it were alive today,"" Smith concedes. But overall, ""we've got a pretty good understanding there — I don't think this is something where we are going to find out that the head is the tail."" Scientists rarely get everything right the first time around. Fortunately, science is self-correcting. It may have taken half a century, but researchers might have finally gotten this weirdo right. Surely, we can bask in the glory of its strangeness for a spell. ""We’ve known this animal for over 100 years, and it just sort of seems wrong that we didn’t know which end was the head and which end was the tail,"" Smith says. ""Even just finding out where the head was was quite exciting, so the fact that it's also key to unlocking a recognized, but poorly defined group… that was really the icing on the cake, I suppose.""

Fitness, nutrition, and sleep have all become data sets to be quantified and analyzed, so it’s only to be expected that some enterprising entrepreneurs would look to extend our passion for tracking to, well, passion itself. Yes, the quantified sex life has arrived, and with it, promises of better sex through algorithms. Yes, the quantified sex life has arrived Recently, a number of quantified sex apps (and at least one gadget) have been introduced. The apps differ in certain respects: Nipple relies on user reported data while Spreadsheets generates data collected through motion sensors; Lovely collects its data through an enhanced cock ring. But they’re all driven by the same basic principle: the more you know about the sex you’ve had in the past, the better sex you will have in the future. By tracking metrics like frequency of sexual encounters, duration of sexual activity, and speed of thrusting, quantified sex apps promise algorithmically enhanced pleasure, improving intercourse through sophisticated data analysis. It’s an alluring proposition — who among us doesn’t want better sex? — but there’s just one problem: there’s no indication that any of these apps actually work.   Generally speaking, we know that consuming a reasonable amount of calories and increasing physical activity will lead to a healthier lifestyle; a corresponding science of sexual pleasure has yet to be mapped out. There’s no optimal level of speed, force, or sexual frequency that’s guaranteed to increase happiness in the bedroom; even trends that have been observed in research won’t necessarily make your sex life better. Studies have shown that happier couples have more sex, but merely increasing your instances of intercourse won’t bring happiness into your bedroom. Similarly, merely increasing the duration of intercourse, or upping the speed of thrusting, won’t guarantee better sex (as chafed ladies everywhere can attest). Optimizing sexual pleasure is a highly subjective — and incredibly personal — process; what matters more than data analysis is simply communication. What about eye contact and dirty talk?Even if sexual metrics can’t point the way to a universally optimized sexual experience, there’s always the possibility of using it to track individual preferences and optimize from there, right? After all, if a couple notices that increasing the duration or speed leads to better orgasms for the both of them, that’s useful data — or it would be, if there were a guarantee that what works in bed one day is guaranteed to work the next. And what of those whose sexual pleasure is correlated to more intangible qualities like emotional state, eye contact, or dirty talk? Motion-based apps won’t be able to capture that data — and that makes their concept of a sexual experience hideously limited, focused solely on intercourse’s mechanical aspects at the expense of essential components like trust, emotional connection, and intimacy. A program that could get couples talking about sex — especially people who are easily embarrassed — could do a lot of good. But it’s not entirely clear that any of these existing sex apps will do that. You can only quantify what you can measure — and that sets up a specific vision of what makes good sex that’s already reinforced by countless porn scenes. Couples are already bombarded with the message that sex is all about rapid thrusting, superhuman stamina, and insatiable libidos. Apps that favor that view of good sex may prevent real discussion of what participants prefer, especially if those preferences are different from preset expectations of what sex is ""supposed"" to look like.   Beyond being merely unhelpful, there’s a chance that these apps might actually hurt some couples — in particular, ones who are coping with troubles in the bedroom, the very people who might turn to these apps in search of a fix. Couples looking to increase frequency or duration or speed may similarly find that focusing on the destination, rather than the journey, makes it harder to end up somewhere happy. There are a number of ways these apps could harm couples’ communication, says sex coach and educator Charlie Glickman. ""I see lots of opportunities for shaming and bad feelings and getting so focused on getting the numbers up rather than doing something that makes your partner happy,"" he says. Sex apps might result in worse, not better, sexual experiences By placing focus on metrics, rather than pleasure itself, sex apps might result in worse, not better, sexual experiences. A man struggling with premature ejaculation might end up more stressed out by quantifying the length of his lovemaking, exacerbating the issue, or even making erection impossible to achieve. To illustrate his point, Glickman mentions a couple who tried a lower-tech version of quantified sex. ""They were trying to figure out what was causing difficulties in their sex life, and so one of them started tracking how often they had sex, who initiated, and how often one of them initiated but then the other didn’t respond,"" he says. ""They were just looking for patterns, but the result of it was that both of them ended up feeling all of this pressure because they didn’t want to get a bad mark on the spreadsheet."" Glickman does have some advice for couples looking to improve their sex through data analysis: ""The only metric [that matters] is how wide someone’s smile is"" at the end of the experience. If we spent our sexual experiences working to optimize that, rather than whatever data our phones might be able to tabulate, we’d likely all be having better sex — even if we don’t have the fancy graphs to prove it.",0.6228419615122172,0.37715803848778284,0.16601574634982544,972,5.1399176954732511,486,6.4485596707818926,1,4,"Science, Tech, Report"

The law bans the sale of cigarettes and e-cigarettes to anyone under 21; it also bans their public possession and consumption until that age.  Bumping the age to 21 is expected to have a big impact The law was passed amid growing concerns about the prevalence of e-cigarettes, the use of which is on the rise among teens. In its legislation, Hawaii notes that a poll of six of its high schools found that 25 percent of 9th and 10th grade students had used an electronic smoking device at least once and 18 percent used one regularly. ""Raising the minimum age as part of our comprehensive tobacco control efforts will help reduce tobacco use among our youth and increase the likelihood that our keiki will grow up to be tobacco-free,"" Hawaii Governor David Ige says in a statement, using the Hawaiian word for children. The state says that 34 percent of its current smokers picked up the habit between the ages of 18 and 20. That could be because that's when cigarette purchases become legal, but it suggests that bumping the age has the potential to significantly discourage smoking among a large group. Recent research from the Institute of Medicine has suggested just as much, with a recent report saying that nationwide smoking prevalence would fall by 12 percent with a national smoking age of 21, according to CNN. While Hawaii has chosen to proactively ban e-cigarettes for those under 21, the US at large is generally undecided on what to do with them. Even Hawaii notes that e-cigarettes could be used as a potentially better alternative to traditional cigarettes, but it also fairly points out that ""more research is needed"" to determine ""whether using electronic smoking devices carries more benefits than risks."" The FDA is expected to issue new guidelines pertaining to that in the near future, which could place national restrictions on e-cigarette sales. Hawaii says tobacco prevention efforts have already had huge health benefits  Hawaii says that it's been aggressive about its tobacco prevention efforts, leading to significant health improvements. The state says that between 2001 and 2012, heart disease deaths dropped 34 percent, stroke deaths dropped 43 percent, and lung cancer deaths dropped 21 percent. It claims to have the third-lowest adult smoking rate in the US, and it evidently wants to maintain that lead. In doing so, Hawaii is adopting what appears to be somewhat stricter laws than most states. It bans the public possession and smoking of cigarettes by people under 21, whereas most states appear to just ban the sale of cigarettes. Violators can be subject to up to a $50 fine, which, if enforced, could disproportionately affect people with lower incomes. This doesn't appear to be a departure from Hawaii's existing policy, however, just a bump to the age limit. Though Hawaii is the first state in the US to raise its smoking age to 21, some local governments have already made the leap. In 2013, New York City prohibited the sale of cigarettes to people under 21, raising the age from 18. That year, Hawaii County already made the change as well, raising the age from 18 to 21.",0.6863513219491624,0.3136486780508376,0.7514898203007735,570,4.8298245614035089,291,5.8865979381443303,1,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World"

The stunt was announced this week in a statement from Women on Waves, a Dutch reproductive rights nonprofit organization that is organizing the flight together with activist groups from Germany and Poland. The 11-pound drone will take off from a German town near the Polish border and deliver the pills to the Polish town of Słubice. ""Women in Poland don't have access to safe abortions,"" says Rebecca Gomperts, the director of Women on Waves, which has used boats to provide contraceptives and safe abortions to women in international waters. ""It's legally restricted, and this is causing a lot of social injustice for a lot of women."" ""it's really important that we continue putting this issue on the agenda."" Poland is one of three European countries, together with Ireland and Malta, where abortion remains illegal except under extreme circumstances. Polish law only permits abortions if the mother's life is in danger, the fetus is abnormal, or in cases of rape or incest, yet activists say access is still limited even in these situations. A so-called ""conscience clause"" allows doctors to deny abortions on the grounds that it violates their personal beliefs, and women who pursue them face stigmatization in predominantly Catholic Poland. As a result, many are forced to travel abroad to terminate their pregnancies, or take matters into their own hands with dangerous underground remedies. The groups behind this week's demonstration say they want to draw attention to the discrepancy between abortion laws in Poland and the majority of the European Union. The drone taking off on Saturday will deliver packages of mifepristone and misoprostol, which are WHO-approved drugs for at-home abortions. They're freely available in most European countries, including Germany, but remain unregistered in Poland. Gomperts says the pills will be delivered to individual women that her organization has identified, adding that the campaign was inspired by the recent drone delivery programs from Google and Amazon. She also acknowledges that the project may face protests from Polish pro-life groups, as the organization did when its mobile boat clinic set sail for Poland in 2003. ""There were quite aggressive protestors there, so we are prepared that that might happen again,"" Gomperts says. ""But this will not stop women from needing an abortion, so it's really important that we continue putting this issue on the agenda.""",0.6168768875963092,0.3831231124036908,0.8543650760626446,429,5.3123543123543122,252,6.2698412698412698,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World"

One of the company's Wi-Fi hotspots, in Virginia's Dulles airport, is reportedly using an ad-injection platform to tamper with the web traffic of users and bombard them with more ads. Jonathan Mayer, a computer scientist and Stanford lawyer, says he discovered ad-injecting code while using the AT&T hotspot in the airport. Mayer noticed ads appearing on educational, government, and ad-supported sites such as The Wall Street Journal, and decided to take a look at the web source, discovering that it was adding lines of code that would pull in promotional materials from outside companies. AT&T's hotspot was reportedly tampering with web traffic Mayer said that the hotspot was making three edits to his traffic. First, he says it added an advertising stylesheet, before injecting a back-up ad, just in case the browser didn't support JavaScript. The hotspot also added two scripts for controlling ad loading and display, code that allows the platform to import the ads themselves from third parties. The ad-injection platform appears to have been built by a company called RaGaPa, a startup whose video pitch, Mayer notes, ""features 'MONETIZE YOUR NETWORK' over cascading dollar signs."" AT&T's Wi-Fi terms of service makes no direct reference to the tool or the company's intention to insert extra ads. In addition to cluttering web pages and slowing down the browsing experience, Mayer says the code introduces an extra security risk, as web developers don't anticipate their sites receiving additional scripts. For now, such tools exist in something of a legal gray area, with the FCC's net neutrality rules and a host of other legislation and rulings theoretically restricting their use. Last year, Comcast started using a similar tool to inject ads across its 3.5 million public Wi-Fi hotspots, and a number of other companies have followed suit. Many of those found to have been using ad-injection tools appear to have dropped them when discovered, including cable and internet company Mediacom, and hotel chain Marriott. The latter pinned the blame on its own ISP when an ad-injection tool was discovered on its Wi-Fi service in 2012. In a statement, the chain said that it was not aware of the tool, and that it did not condone the practice of inserting extra ads into web traffic.",0.4827494002417249,0.517250599758275,0.6101593585613758,383,5.1122715404699735,230,6.0652173913043477,0,0,"Culture, Web"

Both CarPlay and Android Auto are the same here as we've seen them previously, offering quick access to music, messaging, phone calls, maps, and select third-party apps like Spotify and podcast clients. Apple and Google each make heavy use of voice commands to keep your eyes focused on the road at all times. Chevrolet also has its own software features that can sometimes override CarPlay or Android Auto. MyLink's ""Teen Driver"" mode will automatically mute audio until the front two seatbelts are fastened, for example. It's taken some time to get here, but finally you can buy most any Chevy vehicle and know (eventually) it will pair effortlessly with your phone. 2016 7-inch MyLink (both Android Auto and CarPlay)",0.5084738616522844,0.49152613834771564,0.31540832344894715,333,4.9969969969969972,213,5.591549295774648,0,2,"Apple, Google, Tech, Transportation"

The film, narrated by actor Jon Cryer, was premiered on NASA TV this morning and is now available on YouTube (above). For some, the idea of staring down the universe while floating in the vacuum of space sounds like the thrill of a lifetime. Most astronauts will readily admit that it is, but the never let that excitement build too big before also reminding you of the dangers. But part of ""Suit Up"" is specifically dedicated to the terrifying story of Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano, whose suit partially filled with water during an EVA in 2013. Parmitano had to blindly find his way back inside Not only was Parmitano dealing with a failing suit, the decision to end the EVA and get him back inside came when the International Space Station was on the dark side of the Earth. With water filling his helmet, Parmitano had to blindly make his way to the hatch by memory, counting on the hundreds of hours spent practicing spacewalks at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory. (Missing from Suit Up, however, is any discussion of the chain of command problems at NASA that led to the emergency in the first place.) It's not all about the brave women and men who floated outside, freely or tethered, various orbiting spacecraft. All the spacewalking and driving done on the Moon is considered extravehicular activity, too, so NASA throws in a few anecdotes from Buzz Aldrin and Gene Cernan — the second and last men to walk on its surface, respectively. And the short doc points repeatedly to beyond-orbit targets like Mars and the Asteroid Redirect Mission as the next logical steps for the agency, though it doesn't dive into the technical and political difficulties surrounding each. It's easy to understand why agency would shy away from some of those uglier details in such a short film, especially one that was made in service of an anniversary; this is no thorough analysis. But if you need to brush up on your spacewalk history, ""Suit Up"" is full of rosy remembrances of some of NASA's most bold missions, coupled with plenty of agita-inducing footage of humans dangling precariously above our planet.",0.41992539205672896,0.580074607943271,0.8871993797287706,422,4.9691943127962084,278,5.8776978417266186,0,0,"Science, Transportation, Space, Watch This"

But a new startup — based right in Tesla's backyard — is poised to make the Model S look a bit slow. The simply-named Coupe comes from Renovo, which says it has been working on the car and its drivetrain in ""stealth mode"" for the last four years. If it looks familiar, it should: it's basically a Shelby Daytona with the gasoline-sucking bits replaced by a crazy electric drivetrain promising over 500 horsepower and 1,000 ft-lb. of torque (by comparison, the Model S tops out at 416hp and 443 ft-lb.). That's enough to move it from 0 to 60 in ""under"" 3.4 seconds, according to Renovo's literature. Of course, a direct comparison to the Model S sedan isn't really fair — this is a sports car through and through, and it's a testament to the fact that EVs aren't just for normals who want to save on gas. (It's also easy to forget that Tesla itself cut its teeth on a tiny two-place roadster.) Renovo is promising a 30-minute fast charge, a top speed north of 120mph, and a 100-mile range — well short of the 200-plus needed to turn this into a long-haul daily driver. For the wealthy buyers the company is likely targeting at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance this weekend, though, this isn't a first car — it's a second or third.

For eight years now, designer Nicholas Felton has been tackling that question with his annual report, compiled from exhaustive logs of every email, text, and conversation he participated in all year. This year's version is particularly dense, laying out the messages geographically, by vocabulary, and plotting pleasantries vs. content in the final page. In the final accounting, texts made up just over 40 percent of Felton's communications, although two-thirds of the people he talked to were reached over email. The most common profanity was ""hell"" (245 instances), and the most mentioned drugs were Advil (38) and caffeine (26). The most mentioned writer, of course, was Edward Tufte. Tracking Felton's communications by time. March was a particularly heavy email month. Breaking out the data by medium, we see how heavily email an SMS dominate Felton's life. Most of his conversations and calls were with his girlfriend, Olga Bell. Email and mail are dominated by automated services like Big Cartel (a branded clothing website) and Felton's New Yorker subscription. Plotting different people by channel affiliation, we see the crucial role email plays in Felton's life. Many of the people he communicates with are primarily reached by email. By contrast, the sparse grouping around ""telephone"" indicates that there is almost no one who only communicates through phone calls. One interesting note from the reciprocity chart: Felton received far more messages from his girlfriend than he sent to her. In total, Felton recorded 7.7 million words, the vast majority of which came from emails. Conversation and texting combined contributed less than a tenth of email's word count. Relative interrogative use reveals that Felton said the word ""how"" significantly more often in conversation than in any other medium. ""What,"" by contrast, was most often said via SMS. As you might expect, Felton most often had conversations at his home, his workplace, or his studio. He discussed a wide variety of locations, but they are still primarily grouped in Europe and the two American coasts. Dividing conversations by topic is a fuzzier metric, but Felton identified 48,170 unique topics in his message cache — primarily people and places. Felton also identified 25,000 distinct people, roughly four percent of whom were musicians. Roughly one in four conversations involved a formal pleasantry (most typically ""thank you"").

The Pentagon just closed out a two-day tour to win the hearts, minds, and technical talent of Silicon Valley. At a lecture at Stanford yesterday, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter discussed plans to recruit engineers to the Pentagon’s new cybersecurity force, invest in startups, and establish a Defense Department outpost here in the hoodie of innovation. Next he dropped by Facebook to meet with Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg. Today, Carter power-brunched at Andreessen Horowitz’s headquarters, where he met Peter Thiel and Ben Horowitz, as well as CEOs from security startups in the firm’s portfolio. A Defense Department chief hasn't stopped by Silicon Valley in 20 years The visit represents what locals might call a ""pivot"" at the Pentagon. Critics call it ""a long-delayed shift"" in recognizing cyber attacks as a national security threat. The last time a Defense Department chief came to Silicon Valley was the mid-1990s, before everyone started walking around taking selfies with a tracking device in their hand. Carter's plan goes beyond repairing damaged relationships with tech leaders. In order to fight cyberterrorism, the Pentagon intends to take advantage of technological advancements by forging partnerships, investing, and setting up shop next door. While they're at it, his agency would also love to borrow some of the Bay Area's brainiac engineers. ""Startups are the leading edge of commercial innovation, and right now DoD doesn’t have many effective ways to harness the promising technology they come up with,"" he told a packed auditorium at Stanford’s business school. Carter, who took over as defense secretary in February, said the agency struggles to recruit the best and brightest. ""They don’t want to join Ford Motor Company, and they don’t wanna join a government agency; they want flexibility."" The iPhone is full of technology that can be traced back to the Pentagon That kind of realism pervaded Carter’s well-constructed plea to Silicon Valley, which emphasized that the government and private sector face the same threats when it comes to cybersecurity and that the Defense Department and tech industry have been intertwined all along. That’s not the creation myth startups likes to share, but there are plenty of examples. The Valley DoD office will be located in Moffett Field, the civil-military airfield where Google recently signed a 60-year lease. And the Pentagon’s role in startup financing will come from a ""small investment,"" in In-Q-Tel, the 15-year-old non-profit CIA venture fund that backed Palantir. ""Most technologies used throughout Silicon Valley — including many that Apple brilliantly integrated into the iPhone — can be traced back to government DoD research and expenditures,"" said Carter, pointing to GPS, multitouch, and Siri, which grew out of a DARPA-funded project to ""develop a virtual assistant for military personnel."" The DoD isn’t the only agency suddenly sidling up to Silicon Valley. Earlier this month, the National Security Agency told tech companies it would willing to go through ""the front door"" to get to encrypted consumer data, offering the private sector more control over the digital key. (Experts say the plan will never work.) And just this week, the Department of Homeland Security said it’s opening up an office here as well in order to share threats with companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Facebook and Google are still fighting fears that they opened their back door to the NSA Carter told the crowd he wants to ""drill holes"" to make the barrier between the Pentagon and the tech industry more ""permeable."" Permeability may sound like a brazen pitch to a group of execs who are still fighting consumer fears that Facebook and Google opened their back door to the NSA — seeing their company’s logo plastered across those PRISM slideshows probably didn’t help. But the more lasting sore point for tech companies, post-Edward Snowden, seems to be that the surveillance program cost them business in Europe and South America. Secretary Carter didn’t mention it in his talk, but there’s one very effective salve for that wound: money. The Los Angeles Times estimated that Silicon Valley received $12 billion from the Pentagon in 2013, from electronics and software used by defense contractors. Venture capital financing may be plentiful and easy, but what for-profit enterprise wouldn’t want to annex some territory from Lockheed Martin or Boeing? Last week, the Pentagon’s acquisition chief mentioned seeking bids from companies that aren’t competing for government work, according to The Wall Street Journal. The guest list for today’s breakfast included the CEOs for security startups backed by Andreessen Horowitz, including Bromium, Illumio, Tanium, and Lookout. The CEO of GitHub was also invited. What for-profit company would turn their noses at defense contracts? The Defense Department will have a harder time playing the highly competitive game of recruiting engineers, especially without an arsenal of competitive salaries and unlimited perks. Carter’s solution there was to emphasize the exciting technical challenges the Pentagon is working on, like creating ""a more resilient and less vulnerable"" GPS, and using Nobel Prize-winning physics research ""that uses lasers to cool atoms"" in order to develop better timing and navigation technology. His plea was delivered during a particularly interesting time, when the stakes seem high, but so does the sense of invincibility. Carter mentioned the Sony hack, which may be more relevant to the people he is trying to recruit. One question directed at him mentioned that the freshmen entering Stanford were four years old during 9/11. Carter attempted to hammer home how advances in technology come with increasing risks. ""The same internet that enables Wikipedia also allows terrorists to learn how to build a bomb,"" he said, although this part sounded more convincing: GPS signals ""provide navigation not only for ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft, but also our aircraft carriers and our smart bombs. Our reliance on technology has led to real vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit."" The US is trailing behind Russia and China to mitigate these risks, he said, noting increasing ""blended state-and-non-state"" cyber threats to the Pentagon. To make fighting that battle appealing to the private sector, Carter also stressed the idea of popping in and out of public service, joining ""our force of the future, even if just for a time."" As an example, he pointed to the ""sprint team"" of experts working on transferring electronic health records between the Pentagon and Veterans’ Affairs. ""The same internet that enables Wikipedia also allows terrorists to learn how to build a bomb."" DJ Patil, who is working on that project, was recently appointed Chief Data Scientist by President Obama, after working for Silicon Valley institutions like LinkedIn, Greylock Partners, and PayPal. ""We’re working on some of the most unsexy, high-impact things that — if we fix them — are game changers."" Patil said that when he looks back in five or 10 years, he hopes it will seem obvious that techies should spend a year or two in government. If you’re taking a sabbatical, why not recharge by doing something meaningful? ""Take your skills and work for Team America!"" Other high-profile tech execs have recently enlisted. The White House recently appointed Google’s Megan Smith and Twitter’s Jason Goldman to chief digital positions. Whether that appeals to the rank-and-file remains to be seen. But Patil called Carter ""one of the most progressive"" people involved in those efforts to make it easier for smart people to do a stint in government. ""Take your skills and work for Team America!"" If that doesn’t convince the hoodies, how about a friendly reminder that Silicon Valley isn’t the center of the universe? The Department of Homeland Security has been using the same language about lacking talent. Patil said it ""stems directly from POTUS,"" who wants to harness this generation’s talent. ""It’s not a Silicon Valley thing, it’s a tech and skills thing,"" that spans across government, said Patil. ""They’re gonna go out to Boston. They’re gonna go out to Chicago.""",0.5469497746934167,0.45305022530658334,0.8962636569778478,1323,5.3272864701436129,696,6.5474137931034484,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World"

It's the first major test of Matternet's drone technology in a commercial setting, and a crucial milestone for the company. ""The primary aim of this pilot project is a proof of concept to clarify the legal framework, consider local conditions, and explore the technical and business capabilities of the drones,"" Matternet wrote in a statement. If the system performs well, Matternet will use that success to try to convince Swiss Post and similar companies to try to deploy the system at scale. The program will test out a number of Matternet's ONE drones, which the company says can carry packages as heavy as 44 pounds on a single battery charge. The drones are designed to follow preprogrammed routes to avoid collision, but many of the subsequent logistical challenges of local delivery are expected to be worked out in testing.

Hundreds of community members also tuned in to a live stream of the event. Normally, these Town Hall meetings were a celebration of the company’s growth, a chance to highlight exciting new products and discuss upcoming partnerships. But this evening would be different. This was a reckoning.  Quirky’s tagline is ""making invention accessible."" It lets anyone submit an idea, vote on which products should be built, and contribute suggestions for how to tweak the final product. It then handles a lot of the design, manufacturing, and retail distribution, as well as some online sales. The mission of helping small-time inventors succeed has always resonated well with the press. ""It’s easy to think things are going well,"" said founder and CEO Ben Kaufman. He flashed a slide of some glowing coverage on the screen behind him, followed by slides of the growth in the number of products it was creating and the revenue it was generating. ""But this isn’t the full story,"" he concluded, before turning to the bad news. While Quirky’s overall revenue was growing, its losses were mounting as well. And that’s because the business model at Quirky was, for many of its more ambitious products, fundamentally broken. Kaufman highlighted a number of stranger inventions that the company had created: a set of wheels to turn any object into a remote control car and a bathroom mirror that eliminates the fog from shower steam. The company had spent over $800,000 developing the products, but neither one ever made it to store shelves. These were not anomalies. Kaufman pointed to the Beat Booster, a wireless speaker and universal charging station that Quirky spent $388,000 to develop. At the time it had sold fewer than 30 units. And even when products did sell well, the margins were so bad the company often lost money. Quirky had paid out more than $9 million to the inventors who submitted ideas for new products, but it had lost more than $150 million in the process. ""Are these great ideas?"" Kaufman asked. ""Yes. Can Quirky do them justice, sell them, and scale them profitably? No."" The inspiration for Quirky came from Kaufman’s personal experience. In 2005 he decided he would make accessories for the iPod, dropped out of college, and got his parents to refinance their home. He used the cash to travel to China. It was an impulsive, rash, and brilliant bet: Kaufman founded Mophie, which boomed along with the popularity of the iPod and iPhone, making best-selling cases, battery packs, and arm bands. By the age of 20, Kaufman was a star entrepreneur, the top pick on Inc’s 30 under 30 list. In 2007 he sold Mophie, and two years later he founded Quirky with the stated goal of helping lots of people enjoy the same success he had creating new products.     Over the next five years, the company raised $175 million from blue chip investors like RRE, Andreessen Horowitz, and Kleiner Perkins. In 2014 it opened a new customer support center in Schenectady, New York, and a micro-factory in San Francisco. It announced a partnership with GE and spun out an entirely new company, Wink, to focus on creating connected devices for the smart home. As time went on, Quirky moved into making more ambitious electronic hardware. The company’s premier product in 2014 was the Aros, an air conditioner it built with GE that customers control through the Wink app. Quirky partnered with Uber and bought a small fleet of ice cream trucks to deliver them to customers with a flourish. Kaufman, billing himself as the world’s least important CEO (a title he still uses on LinkedIn) began appearing on billboards and nationally televised commercials. At that point Quirky was launching three new products each week. Its merchandise sold everywhere from from Target, to Walgreens, to the Museum of Modern Art. The company seemed poised to become the next great consumer brand across categories as diverse as electronics, pet toys, and cookware. But while Quirky appeared more successful than ever, in reality the company’s finances were rapidly deteriorating.     A former staffer we spoke with recalled the process of ""pre-val,"" where the staff went over submissions before starting to design and engineer them. ""It came up on the board and everyone had a few laughs about it, but the serious consensus in the room was that this was not a viable product. At the price point it would cost to make, we can’t make enough money or sell enough volume,"" they said. ""A lot of good business and technical rational went into that. Ben comes in and says, ‘We’re doing this.’ So we did, and it did not work out well for the company."" In many ways Kaufman was still that crazy kid, going with his gut. Even when products did make sense, Kaufman was often overly aggressive about how many they could sell, say former employees. After returns, the company ended up with a glut of unsold inventory it was later forced to liquidate at pennies on the dollar.     ""We needed to test the product before we ship it!"" said one former employee, speaking not about Aros specifically, but the design and engineering process at Quirky in general. Kaufman often wanted to skip that phase in order to move faster. ""He doesn’t want to listen to those realities. He wanted to run the company based on the fantasy he thinks it should run on."" Quirky had just above $50 million in the bank in February of 2014 and was burning through an average of $5.8 million a month. The company wanted to raise new funding, but wasn’t getting traction with investors. Finally, in September of 2014, it brought in a new CFO, Ed Kremer, who had been working as the VP of finance at Beats. Kremer knew the company had to make drastic changes, and fast, or it would be out of cash. So starting in October, the company instituted a series of deep cutbacks. Between October of 2014 and this February's Town Hall when Kaufman publicly disclosed Quirky’s woes, the company let go more than a third of its staff. It ceased production on the majority of products it had in development, even those into which it had sunk hundreds of thousands of dollars. And, according to employees, it stopped paying its bills for a number of services.     So where does Quirky go from here? I met with Kaufman recently at the company’s headquarters in New York. He was humble and emotional, obviously pained by the changes of the last 18 months. ""It hasn’t been easy,"" he said. ""This company is my life."" Quirky has a plan to turn things around. First, it’s drastically reducing the number of categories in which it will produce its own products. Instead of a dozen different verticals, it will now operate in just three: the connected home products it makes with GE, the new line of Poppy appliances that work with Amazon Dash, and electronics like Pivot Power that have been very successful. Second, the company is shifting to focus more on helping to create products for other companies, and less on creating products itself. The initiative, Powered by Quirky, started with GE last year. Since then it has signed on audio company Harman and toy giant Mattel. Quirky’s community will still submit ideas, and the company will help shepherd the best ones to a point where they can be produced. But the working capital to actually design, develop, manufacture, and market will be spent by these corporate giants, not Quirky. ""It’s a total flip, the exact reverse. The old model was we pay for everything and then give a royalty"" says Kaufman. ""The new model is, partner pays for everything and they give us a royalty, some of which we give to the community."" To help handle and acquire these new partners, Quirky recently acquired Undercurrent, an organizational design consultant. Kaufman says some of the cuts made to staff were to make room for this new headcount. ""These guys are account managers, they have the skills to tend to the kind of relationships we’re trying to build with big brands,"" says Kaufman. ""We were a product company, so this is new ground for us."" Helping giant corporations to innovate is decidedly less inspiring than enabling unknown inventors. But Quirky insists that community members will get the same rewards and recognition, even if Mattel or Harman is the one paying to produce the product. As it signs on these brands, inventors will get a bigger platform for their ideas. Of course, to work in the long run, the company will have to show it can pick the ideas that will be winners for whomever is selling them. That may be tougher now that rewards to the community have also been cut back, halved from 10 to five percent in February. ""I think this is a natural evolution, as the scale of the opportunity on the platform grows."" says Kaufman, also claiming the number of new ideas submitted continues to rise. ""Five percent of the hundred million dollars in revenue that we will do is more than 10 percent of the revenue we did two years ago."" Kaufman admits that he made some mistakes. ""To be blunt, we overbought in some categories,"" he told me. For a while, he says, ""the company lacked a strong financial leader."" Before Kremer, the company would pay community member rewards when items were sold to a retailer like Target, but didn’t get any of that money back if the goods were returned. They will now hold back 15 percent each quarter to account for that. ""We overpaid the community by $1.9 million."" He says that it’s true the company has a few payments due, but contends that it never stopped paying entirely or defaulted on any debts. He wrote in an email that ""each of these issues are unique (dispute on services rendered, etc). We have been paying people consistently through this period of change."" Interviews with employees past and present often cut both ways. They would praise Kaufman’s dedication and energy, but also blame the financial woes on his lack of attention to detail and inability to accept advice. ""The bottom line is always with Ben,"" said one former employee. ""He is incredibly inspiring, intelligent, and tireless in running that company, but everyone is under his thumb."" Kaufman says he has heard the criticism and is working to change. ""I have indeed learned that the 'Ben projects' don't always go as planned."" Still, he wants to keep a bit of the wild ambition that sparked Mophie, and that he believes drives Quirky to embrace a community of inventors. ""Do I throw my personal opinions around every now and then and encourage the company, its investors, and all around to swing big? Yes. Has that always worked for us? No."" His new CFO and new business model, Kaufman hopes, have ""given me the guardrails I need to be able to be myself without always betting the farm.""

Likewise, Google's cost-per-click (essentially how much it charges for its ads) dropped 13 percent year over year.    That's part of the ongoing trend of consumers increasing moving to mobile phones, where Google isn't yet able to charge as much as it does for advertising served on desktop sites.

The company is the first major fast food chain to entirely remove GMOs from its menus, spanning 1,831 different locations worldwide. For anti-GMO activists, the hope is that this will inspire similar changes across the industry, similar to the company's stance on agricultural antibiotics. Since 1999, the company has committed to using meat from animals raised without antibiotics or hormones, despite significant supply chain pressure as the company has grown. Recently, other chains like McDonald's have followed suit, a move that many attribute to market pressure from Chipotle. But while antibiotic resistance is a real and growing problem, the harmful effects of GMOs are still largely unproven. The bulk of the scientific research shows the benefits of genetic modification far outweighing the risks, and many see the crops as crucial to fighting world hunger.

The dump also includes intercepts from conversations between various French officials, including intelligence summaries.

The world of wireless spectrum can be dense and confusing, and unless you really need to, you probably wouldn't try to get people talking about it. But T-Mobile really needs to do it: the difference between getting spectrum and not getting spectrum could be the difference between competing with AT&T and Verizon and wasting away in third place.    Spectrum makes a network better, and T-Mobile wants more of it  When T-Mobile talks about spectrum, it's talking about the airwaves used to connect your phone to its network. Broadly speaking, the more spectrum a carrier has, the better its network can be. But there's a bit more to it than that. Some spectrum is much, much better than other spectrum. ""Sprint has all of this spectrum, but ... it doesn't travel very far and it gets stopped by wet leaves. Literally wet leaves,"" says Harold Feld, senior vice president of the advocacy group Public Knowledge.  T-Mobile wants to get people riled up because it and other carriers are going to have another chance to get more spectrum very soon. And not just any spectrum. If this spectrum were an illicit drug, it would undoubtedly be called the good shit. The kind of spectrum you get once in a lifetime. The kind of spectrum you'd shell out huge sums of money for. That's because this spectrum falls within a particularly low range of frequencies, the 600MHz band, and that makes it far more capable than the higher frequency airwaves that get caught up by wet leaves. The 600MHz spectrum is much better at penetrating walls and traveling long distances. Fewer cell towers have to be put up to transmit it, which results in lower costs and a stronger network all at the same time. The FCC already plans to give small carriers their own bucket to bid on An auction for this spectrum is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2016, but the rules for the auction will likely be finalized next month by the FCC. And that's why T-Mobile's CEO sat down to record a video. His company wants the FCC to make a big change before the rules are finalized. Right now, the FCC is setting aside a block, at most 30MHz in size, for companies that don't already own a large portion of good low-band spectrum in any given market — it's basically a safe haven from AT&T and Verizon. But T-Mobile, as well as a group of others including Sprint, Dish, and Public Knowledge, argue that 30MHz is too small. They claim that AT&T and Verizon already control almost three-quarters of the available low-band spectrum, so the maximum reserved block should be bumped up to at least 40MHz so the field doesn’t become even more unbalanced. The result might be roughly equal blocks of 40MHz that AT&T and Verizon can win and 40MHz that smaller companies, like T-Mobile and Sprint, can win. In short, the four-company mobile landscape thrives. Everyone wins! Or so the argument goes.  T-Mobile's latest spectrum ad. Click only if you're comfortable with seeing cartoon Tom Wheeler in spandex. T-Mobile has indicated that it wants this spectrum to help build out its rural coverage, something that the 600MHz band is particularly good for because it can travel far. But AT&T says that isn’t a good reason to boost the reserve. The reserve will primarily be in effect in big markets like New York City, San Francisco, and Chicago, AT&T says, so it won’t be barred from bidding in rural areas in, say, Iowa. Essentially, the reserve is most meaningful when it comes to cities. ""Instead of falling for that magenta herring, policymakers should be inviting all bidders to compete for rural licenses that come with stringent build requirements,"" Joan Marsh, AT&T’s federal regulatory VP, wrote last week. Verizon is more blunt in identifying at least one reason why T-Mobile wants the larger reserve, calling it ""more discounted spectrum on the taxpayer’s dime."" Spectrum in the reserve will likely cheaper  ""It's as much about the economics as it is about anything else,"" says Mark Lowenstein, leader of the consulting firm Mobile Ecosystem and a former Verizon Wireless executive. ""If there is some sort of reserve than it is likelier that the price doesn't get bid up in quite the same way."" Getting some of — if not a sizable portion of — this chunk of spectrum is particularly important to would-be AT&T and Verizon competitors because it's pretty much the last chance they're going to get for a while. Spectrum is limited, and there isn't another auction like this one for, potentially, decades. Getting more spectrum now doesn't just mean having a higher quality network, it also means being able to grow. ""The amount of spectrum you have sets a natural limit on how many customers you have,"" Feld says. ""If you cram too many customers into too little spectrum, the quality of the network goes down. If they don't get this stuff, then they’re kinda at their natural limit of how many customers they can get."" Without winning some of this spectrum, Feld says, ""They're really not going to be able to challenge AT&T and Verizon."" ""No single party will be happy with everything we’ve done."" It's not clear how the FCC decided on the size of the auction reserve, but there is the matter of money to consider: the reserved block will have fewer bidders, which means it may bring in less money. In this auction's case, that's a particularly important consideration, because the auction needs to entice television broadcasters into giving up their spectrum to carriers. The commission has to balance the need for money with the need for competition, and that's not an easy task. ""No single party will be happy with everything we’ve done, but the final product is a balanced solution to a challenging situation with more moving parts than a Swiss watch,"" Tom Wheeler, FCC chairman, wrote last week. The 30MHz reserve is still a win That's why, chances are, T-Mobile is going to have to work with the maximum 30MHz chunk that's already been announced as a reserve. Early reports have suggested that the FCC isn't interested in increasing its size, which means that those smaller companies will likely have a harder time picking up as much new spectrum as they'd like. Of course, that's not exactly a bust. There's still a large chunk of spectrum set aside for T-Mobile, Sprint, Dish, and other small carriers — they just aren't getting the even sweeter deal that they were pushing for. This is still only the very beginning of the auction; if it were a race, the competitors wouldn’t even be at the starting line yet. We still have to wait to see how much 600MHz spectrum will actually be made available. And from there, we'll have to wait to see what T-Mobile, Sprint, and Dish — not to mention the two biggest carriers — actually want out of it. More spectrum may be better, but when you're spending huge sums of money to acquire and put it into use, you have to pick and choose carefully.",0.14619500791923884,0.8538049920807611,0.16205813648585596,1219,4.7391304347826084,545,5.8440366972477067,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World"

Then-showrunner Frank Darabont pulled off what amounted to a six-episode magic trick, extending a well-worn premise into a show with real legs, and now five years later it’s time for AMC’s latest prequel series, Fear the Walking Dead. Rather than telling another set of stories in the post-zombiepocalypse, the new show takes place in Los Angeles just as things start falling apart. It’s territory that’s largely been glossed over in the original series, providing a new playground to explore while audiences wait for zombies to create the devastated world they’ve been watching these past few years.  Judging from the first two episodes, waiting makes for some pretty good TV. Like its predecessor, Fear the Walking Dead is an ensemble show, but rather than pulling a ragtag group of survivors together over the course of a few episodes, it starts right off with an extended family. Gone Girl’s Kim Dickens (continuing her run as one of our greatest unsung character actors) plays high school guidance counselor Madison, who’s been struggling with her drug addict son Nick (Frank Dillane). Nick was recently caught by the cops after running into traffic, smacked out of his mind and raving about how he’d just seen a friend eat somebody’s face off (dun-dun-dun!). Nick is put into the hospital for observation, where Madison’s live-in boyfriend Travis (Cliff Curtis) and daughter Alicia (Alycia Debnam-Carey) come to help. Madison and Travis slowly begin to unravel the mystery of Nick’s ramblings, while at the same time students mysteriously stop coming to school. Word of a strange outbreak starts to spread, and as the public grows concerned and authorities overreact, things inevitably go sideways. In a sense, it feels likes Fear is mashing four or five different shows together. There’s the story of the addict son and his struggle with withdrawals; there’s Madison’s attempt to hold her family (and school) together; there’s Travis’ complicated relationship with his own son and ex-wife; there’s Alicia’s adolescent need to distance herself from her mom. And then oh yeah — there’s also that whole thing about people starting to come back to life and eating you. It’s a lot to parse — and that’s before Ruben Blades shows up as a barbershop owner with a family of his own. But the arcs all coalesce into something that feels dense and familiar, the banal issues of real life heightened and set against a supernatural backdrop that brings a constant sense of stakes and danger. Even when the show wobbles — I found Dillane’s over-affected performance as Nick to be particularly distracting, even within the Beautiful People With Drug Problems subgenre — Dickens and Curtis anchor the show by building two strong, believable character that I found myself involved with incredibly quickly. That’s a big part of what makes the original show work too, of course. The Walking Dead has been notorious for its slow, deliberate pacing, to the frustration of many fans that want a more action-oriented show — but taking the time to build characters and relationships is what makes the whole thing work. Nobody gets upset when a cardboard archetype is felled in the midst of zombie battle, but when you fuck with Hershel, people get pissed. But if knowledge of The Walking Dead helps set expectations for what the new show will be dramatically, it also lets Fear surpass the original in terms of sheer tension and anxiety. When walkers are afoot in the original series, you’re already half-expecting that  somebody you care about will get hurt, maimed, or killed — but when you’re dealing with the dawn of the apocalypse, every moment is loaded. A simple shot of a crowded school bus had me holding my breath for a zombie reveal. The show’s long, lingering looks at the Los Angeles skyline are full of implied menace. Every single moment  of Fear the Walking Dead, big or small, is filled with the dreadful anticipation that this could be the precise moment when things finally go off the rails. It’s operating off a premise that our scariest films and shows understand. Fear and terror aren’t created with jump scares or grisly murder scenes; they live in the moments before the bad things happen. The empty space where your mind can fill in the most horrible event imaginable. That’s when you ask yourself Why is this character walking down this hallway? and Shouldn’t they know better? and Dear god just look behind you! The waiting is when you really get scared. Everything else is release. And whether by design or happenstance, Fear the Walking Dead is filled with that pending tension in almost every single scene. But it also raises a problematic question for the series, one that’s just slightly different from that asked of the original: How can this thing differentiate itself? According to the show’s creators, the first season of Fear the Walking Dead is going to take place in the four to five months when, in the chronology of the universe, Sheriff Rick Grimes was unconscious in a Georgia hospital. It’s unexplored territory, and as long as we’re waiting for the final shoe of civilization’s collapse to drop, Fear will be able to distinguish itself from its predecessor. But what happens after that goes down? The show’s already been renewed for a second season, and at first glance there are two different directions things could end up going. One would be to eke out additional storylines in the time before the world collapses. The other would be to follow a group of survivors as they struggle their way through a post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland. The first has potential, but seems unlikely; the second is something we’ve already seen. It’s called The Walking Dead, and it airs Sundays on AMC.

Learn more. Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart are shuffling into theaters this weekend with American Ultra, a weird little movie that grafts stoner lethargy onto clandestine government intelligence operations. This is the kind of late summer lark where action sequences are cushioned with clouds of smoke and bad guys are killed by bullets ricocheting off of frying pans: it's completely frivolous in the best sense of the word. It's not getting great reviews, but its status as a showcase for two of the best young American actors working justifies its existence. Eisenberg takes the edge off his trademark anxious energy with the help of numerous prop joints; Stewart gets to put an unexpected spin on the ""damsel in distress"" role she suffered through c. the Twilight Saga. It's not the first time they've worked together in a shaggy, smoked-out comedy. Eisenberg and Stewart first teamed up for Adventureland, a humble '80s coming-of-age movie released in 2009 that's ambled its way toward the designation of ""cult classic."" It's studded with sparkling minor appearances by actors like Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig; the music, curated by veteran indie band Yo La Tengo, is pitch perfect; it's the kind of movie you watch with your friends on a hungover undergrad Sunday morning when you're not quite ready to leave each other's company. Eisenberg and Stewart carry it with performances that are touching, complex, and earned. They feel like versions of people you know. Eisenberg and Stewart are an unpredictable, talented pair A lot has changed for both performers in the six years between working together. Eisenberg was feted as a generational talent for his work in The Social Network one year later, only to become a surprisingly bankable star and a credible choice to play Lex Luthor; Stewart lurched and lip-bit her way through Twilight movies that printed money before journeying into the wilderness and emerging an intense, honest performer with singular taste. They make for an unpredictable and talented pair, and they're going to continue to evolve and cross paths over the next decade. Let's evaluate their progress in the years separating Adventureland and American Ultra on a number of distinct fronts. We can chalk up Stewart's early box office dominance to the performance of her Twilight movies, as well as that of Snow White and the Huntsman. Those five movies all made more money than Eisenberg's highest-grossing movie, 2011's animated comedy Rio, and three of the four Twilight movies made double Rio's total. (The only one that didn't, 2011's Breaking Dawn - Part 1, fell just short.) Eisenberg has racked up a series of mid-tier hits highlighted by movies like Zombieland and 2013's street magic thriller Now You See Me, but he hasn't yet made anything with Twilight-level box office potential. (That should change next year, when he'll appear in both a Now You See Me sequel and Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.) Stewart's total plummeted in 2013 because she didn't release a movie that year — an unofficial hiatus likely prompted by her infidelity scandal a year earlier — and her 2014 was marked by well-received but small independent films like Clouds of Sils Maria and Still Alice. American Ultra will become her first movie of 2015, so that space is empty too. From a critical perspective, Stewart takes a few knocks thanks to the execrable reputation of the Twilight series. Those movies pin down her Rotten Tomatoes averages from 2009 to 2011, and then something unexpected happens: she overtakes her more feted male counterpart in 2012 and 2014, the years in which she's released new movies post-Twilight. Her victory in 2012 isn't worth much, as both she and Eisenberg appear in a handful of mediocre movies; you could chalk her win up to margin of error. But her work in 2014 is definitively superior, and even within those higher-quality movies she earns special mention for the strength of her work. (She became the first American actress to win a César, France's national film award, for her performance in Clouds of Sils Maria.) Eisenberg chugs along with decent work in every year studied save 2012, but his high 2015 score is dependent on the strength of one movie, The End of the Tour. When it comes to public interest, Stewart grounds Eisenberg into a fine powder. It turns out the combination of Twilight and tabloids makes for Google Trends domination. Stewart's relationship with co-star Robert Pattinson amplified the series' infamy and generated tons of interest in its own right, and the 2012 revelation of her affair with Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders ignited an emotional powder keg. Her relationships with both Pattinson and Sanders are history now, but the media has maintained interest in her personal life, particularly her ambiguous sexuality. Eisenberg has to compare visiting Comic-Con to ""some kind of genocide"" to earn even a fraction of the attention dumped on Stewart. He could be absorbed into the superhero media machine as early as this fall, but he's managed to maintain a low profile thus far. Their careers are eclectic, curious, and flawed in interesting ways Looking at the whole of their last half-decade of work, it's clear that Eisenberg and Stewart have managed to strike balances most young actors and actresses struggle to find. They've dipped their toes into the world of mega-franchises without marginalizing their more vital and distinct work; they've found their way into movies that have achieved modest success and acclaim when the industry is more polarized than ever; they've assembled filmographies that are eclectic, curious, and flawed in intriguing ways. American Ultra might not make a lasting impression on either actor, but it's a pleasure to watch them work together again. I hope I have reason to evaluate the work they've yet to do sometime in the future.

Bejar is notorious for carrying out radical stylistic changes between albums, and Poison Season doesn't change that trend.

Learn more. Dirty Dancing is the most important mainstream film of the 1980s. That may not be saying much, considering the decade doesn't stand up to the unapologetically sexy and violent studio films of the 1970s and the dialogue-heavy indie movies of the 1990s. I suspect its place in the '80s has been responsible for its status as pop culture kitsch, and that's a shame. Dirty Dancing should be remembered for all the audacious risks its script and direction took, and not for a single, cutesy lift. That's why I've created this quiz, to remind people who think they remember Dirty Dancing about what the film actually had to say. Don't read the rest of this story until you complete the quiz!  Dirty Dancing — like so many great films with female protagonists — has been wrongly generalized as a mindless romantic comedy. I don’t want to give that aspect of the film short shrift, because it’s funnier than most films, and more romantic than all films, but it’s also feminist, sex-positive, and pro-choice. And it expresses these traits in proud, blunt fashion. In the opening scene, we learn Baby has progressive views, and hopes to help those less fortunate than her, but those views and aspirations have never been challenged in the real world. Baby’s good spirited, but naive. Over the course of the film, Baby learns the value of hard work, discovers her sexuality, loses her virginity, doesn’t judge the sexuality of her peers and her own lover, helps a young woman through an abortion, and stands up to her father whose actions don’t always match his beliefs. Baby is in control of her identity and flexes against those who question that. And she can carry watermelons like a pro. She’s badass. Dirty Dancing wouldn't be made by today's risk-adverse studios, which is why it shouldn’t be perceived as some forgettable film from the 1980s. It doesn't have superheroes or computer-generated aliens or explosions, but it does have genuine substance.

With privacy firmly in the minds of internet users this week, Wired jumped straight on Spotify's new policy to brand it an ""eerie"" agreement ""you can't do squat about."" In a reaction piece, Wired says the various complaints around the new privacy policy include a big addition that has internet alarm bells ringing: ""With your permission, we may collect information stored on your mobile device, such as contacts, photos, or media files. Local law may require that you seek the consent of your contacts to provide their personal information to Spotify, which may use that information for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy."" An overreaction to a policy that needs work Apps collecting any personal information like photos or contacts should really have a good explanation of why they need to do so. If you compare Spotify's privacy policy to Twitter's, it's clear Spotify's is far too broad without examples or vital context and detail around the data gathering the service is implementing. Twitter provides examples clearly, but Spotify just wants you to accept information will be collected. Without this necessary context, Wired simply claims Spotify wants to see and collect your photos and who you're talking to just ""like a jealous ex."" It's an overreaction by Wired and other publications that totally ignores the important ""with your permission"" clause, suggesting that Spotify will prompt you to share this information instead of secretly stealing it, and with the ability to opt-out and carry on using the service normally. So what is Spotify actually doing here? Reading the privacy policy objectively, it's clear Spotify is planning to introduce some new features in upcoming app updates. At present, the Spotify iOS app doesn't request access to photos or contacts data. While Spotify isn't detailing any new additions just yet, a statement from the company reveals ""the data accessed simply helps us to tailor improved experiences to our users, and build new and personalized products for the future."" That's nice, but it still doesn't explain why I need to share my contact information or photos with the service. Thankfully, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek jumped on Twitter this morning to argue with Minecraft creator Markus Persson (Notch) about the privacy policy. On the subject of accessing photos, Ek compares Spotify's use of photos to Twitter and its privacy policy. ""Twitter doesn't need your photos. But it's nice that I can post a photo,"" explains Ek. ""Similarly, I'd argue it's a nice thing that I can upload a photo to my playlist to personalize it."" So it's clear that the photos addition isn't to harvest all of your nudes like some crazy jealous ex, but to introduce a new feature to change profile pictures or personalize playlist photos. That makes a lot more sense than stealing your entire camera roll. Equally, Ek reveals that the contacts addition is for a new way to find friends that use Spotify rather than a evil way to harvest your address book and prank call your mom. Stop with the FUD, please So, panic over? Kind of. While Ek was quick to explain these additions on Twitter, that context and transparency hasn't made its way into the privacy policy yet, and it's something that should be fully explained. Wired claims there's nothing you can do about Spotify's new privacy policy, but there is. Instead of spreading FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt), a reasonable debate around smarter and more transparent terms of use or even why all these apps constantly need this data would be a way to hold Spotify and many other companies to account. In an age where hackers and government agencies can obtain mountains of personal data, consumers should be more aware about the type of information they share with companies.

Learn more. This has been a landmark year for movies, but not in the way many of us might have expected. Blockbusters came out in droves to stake a claim at the box office, including the return of the Terminator and Mad Max franchises. But with summer coming to an end, many of the major studios' biggest efforts haven't captured the hearts and minds of audiences. Mad Max: Fury Road will certainly go down in history as one of our era's best action films, but Fantastic Four was both a critical and commercial failure, up there with some of the worst movies ever made. But where studios might not have raised the bar in terms of quality, the year's biggest movies certainly ran away with our wallets. And no studio has earned more money this year than Universal Pictures. Furious 7 and Jurassic Park both managed to make more than a billion dollars worldwide, meaning Universal has already set new benchmarks for how much money can be made in one year — and 2015 isn't even over yet. Check out the chart below to see the breakdown for the last four years in sales in the States alone:  As of this month, no other studio is even close to making that much. No studio has even ever crossed $2 billion in domestic sales before. (Universal is also the only studio to be trending upward, so executives must be really happy this year.) The only companies to get close are Sony in 2012 and Warner Bros. in 2013. But Sony has no chance of reaching its 2012 heyday for awhile, as it's still reeling from last year's crippling hacks. Warner Bros., on the other hand, may be content to have a low year, what with Batman v. Superman and Suicide Squad both coming out in 2016. Paramount and Lionsgate both usually take the bottom rung of the top-grossing studios, so there are no surprises there. But seeing 20th Century Fox make so little might be surprising. Blame the abject failure of Fantastic Four. When you bank on a big movie and it tanks, it can crater how much you expect to make for the rest of the year. Star Wars could change the game That leaves Disney, and it's too soon to tell if it can claim the top spot. Why? Star Wars. If The Force Awakens can break all records in its first few weeks at the box office on its way to a billion dollars globally — and it will make a billion — Disney will prove that its formula for building massive brands works, stealing away what could have been Universal's year.

This Sunday, a routine SpaceX launch could turn revolutionary, as the spaceflight company tries for a third time to safely land its Falcon 9 rocket after takeoff. The uncrewed booster will be carrying the company’s Dragon cargo capsule, packed full of science experiments and supplies to bring to the crew of the International Space Station. Yet many will be waiting eagerly after the launch is over to see if the rocket finds its way to its landing pad. SpaceX holds a contract with NASA’s Commercial Cargo Resupply (CRS) Program to launch a number of cargo resupply missions to the station through 2017. The upcoming launch marks the seventh planned mission for SpaceX under the program. The exciting part of the launch isn’t really the launch itself — it’s the landing This particular mission will be the first resupply launch after Russia’s Progress spacecraft malfunctioned in April. The Progress — which was stocked full of food, science experiments, and other supplies — ceased communication with ground control shortly after launching into space and started spinning wildly out of control. It later burned up in Earth’s atmosphere. Fortunately, NASA says this SpaceX launch is mostly unaffected by the Progress mishap; SpaceX made only a few adjustments to make up for the failed resupply mission. But even if Sunday’s launch were to take a fiery turn, things would still be fine for the station’s crew. ""Nothing on that Progress that was lost was irreplaceable,"" NASA spokesperson Rob Navias tells The Verge. ""The station has more than enough supplies to last well into the year, even if another supply ship did not arrive."" The exciting part of the launch isn’t really the launch itself, or the resupply — it’s the landing. Since January, SpaceX has been trying to safely land the majority of its Falcon 9 rocket on a free floating barge. It’s a feat that would be revolutionary if done right. All current rockets are either destroyed or regarded somewhat like trash after takeoff, left to burn up or fall to the bottom of the ocean. If SpaceX can keep most of its rockets intact after launch, then it can reuse them and make spaceflight a hell of a lot cheaper.  SpaceX has tried this landing technique twice so far this year. Its first attempt in January was an explosive one; the main shaft of the Falcon 9 was able to guide itself to the floating spaceport, but the rocket ran out of the fuel needed to slow it down. The result: the rocket hit the barge hard and fast in what SpaceX CEO Elon Musk dubbed a ""rapid unscheduled disassembly."" In April, the company tried again. Video of the attempt shows the rocket gently lowering itself down to the barge while remaining upright. But it began to tilt — and then fall, leading to another explosion.  Perhaps this third time will be the charm for SpaceX. If so, Musk could usher in a new era of affordable spaceflight, and maybe get himself that volcano lair he’s been eyeing.

They're nervous and quick — and no one likes a small, nervous, quick thing. But one robot seems to be going against the grain. It's a cockroach-inspired machine, and it might give you nightmares. Before it was round, the cuboid robot just got stuck When I think of robots, I don't think machines that ""scurry."" Mice scurry. Cockroaches scurry. Robots? They jump over things like weird-looking leopards or fall over themselves like the lumbering chunks of metal they are. They certainly do not scurry. That said, this thing is cool. No matter how weird it is to watch it move around like something I'd be tempted to crush with a shoe, the fact that this tiny robot is both fast and nimble is kind of amazing. But what's even more interesting is the reason for its agility. Because, as it turns out, that's largely a function of its shape.  The first robot designed by this team of engineers was shaped like a cube, says Chen Li, a mechanical engineer at the University of California-Berkeley and a co-author of the Bioinspiration & Biomimetics study that describes the machine. ""This made the robot turn left or right when it touched obstacles and become stuck."" But a thin, rounded exoskeletal shell — the current design — lets the robot roll and fit its thin body through small gaps, just like a cockroach. And the researchers are certain that shape is the only variable responsible for this robot's newfound agility. The control program stayed the same, ""so we know that it was only the shell shape that enabled its traversal,"" Li says.    Credit: Chen Li. Courtesy of PolyPEDAL Lab, Biomimetic Millisystems Lab, and CiBER, UC Berkeley Most robots try to avoid obstacles This might come as a surprise, but a tiny robot that can navigate rough terrain and tiny gaps without the use of sensors is pretty innovative. Most robots deal with obstacles by avoiding them. They use maps, path planning and feedback control to go around objects that stand in their way. And that approach has worked out really well, for the most part. But when you're working with a tiny robot — one that's about 7 inches long — working with large, heavy, expensive sensors is a huge hassle. So the fact that changing this robot's outer shell had such a big impact could open up a ton of possibilities for the robotics industry. Rounded shells could be used to build small, inexpensive robots for search and rescue missions or precision agriculture, Li ventures. Building this robot took two years. During that time, the scientists spent a lot of time observing insects move through laser cut paper ""beams"" intended to act like grass. ""The goal was to understand how small animals traverse dense obstacles,"" Li says. Good for small search and rescue robots Mimicking the forms we see in nature isn't a new design technique; nature's chaos is a far better engineer than humans will ever be. Still, a cockroach-inspired robot can be unsettling. So I've come up with a way to make it a bit more palatable. Instead of imaging it running up your bedroom walls, think of the robot as some sort of friendly Wall-E, pet-cockroach hybrid. Cartoons just make everything better, don't they?

But when you dig into the details, some of the numbers are surprising. For instance, technology is far too often associated with the middle-class and the rich, inaccessible by the poor. With wireless, though, adults living in poverty are more likely to live in a wireless-only home than their more well-off counterparts: 59.4 percent versus 42.5 percent for those making more than twice the poverty line (the threshold for what the NHIS calls ""Not Poor""). In that segment of the market, the many, many prepaid carriers and plans available may be filling a need that landlines have not.  Some of the data might surprise you Other trends hew more closely to what you might expect. The wireless-only lifestyle is most common in the 25-29 and 30-34 age groups, at 69.2 and 67.4 percent respectively in the most recent reporting period, July to December of 2014. It's slightly lower in the 18-24 demographic — 58 percent — likely because these individuals are more likely to be living at home with their parents, an age group where landlines become far more common. At 65 and over, landline-free households represent just 17.1 percent of the surveyed group. And the least likely to have a landline? That'd be adults living with other unrelated adults without children — i.e. roommates — where just 18.7 percent have an old-fashioned phone in the house. That makes sense, considering that each roommate is living their own life and has little interest in sharing a single phone. Overall, some 45.4 percent of households are wireless-only, an increase of 4.4 percent against the same period a year prior. And the rate of adoption is accelerating: the year before that, NHIS saw a 2.8 percent change. American landline operators have been angling to start phasing out copper service for some time, replacing it with more modern (and, in many cases, cheaper-to-maintain) services like fiber and wireless. It may seem like a win-win, but old-school, circuit-switched copper has one thing going for it: bulletproof reliability, which has been a sticking point for migration in light of 911 concerns. And, of course, there's the simple fact that the most rural parts of the US still often lack reliable cellular service.

And in doing so, they designed what looks like the most promising candidate for a chlamydia vaccine that we've seen in a long time. Chlamydia is the most widespread bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the world. In the US, over 1 million chlamydial infections were reported to CDC in 2013. Most people clear the infection on their own, but in some cases, it can cause infertility in women, ectopic pregnancies, pneumonia, and pelvic inflammatory disease. And when the infection occurs in the eyes, chlamydia can lead to blindness. In fact, it's the most common cause of preventable blindness. That's why a vaccine for this particular STI is so dearly needed. Most people don't seek treatment because they don't show any visible signs of infection — and then they pass it on. Unfortunately, research on chlamydia vaccines hasn't gone all that well, historically. In the 1960s, scientists designed a number of chlamydia vaccines that they then tested on humans — including very young children — in developing countries. But the vaccine didn't always have the desired effect; in some cases, people who were vaccinated became more likely to develop chlamydia than people who weren't. The result was puzzling, especially given that other studies showed that people who had previously been infected with chlamydia tended to show an attenuated response to subsequent infections. Chlamydia vaccine research in humans became less popular after that period, and researchers never figured out why their vaccines had this less than desirable effect. Now, writing in Science, a group of researchers think they might have figured it out. Their research shows that killed Chlamydia bacteria — the kind you might use to make a vaccine — activates our immune systems in a way that makes us more tolerant to the infection. And what's even more exciting is that the finding has helped scientists develop a nano-particle-based vaccine that can redirect our immune systems in a far more favorable direction. First, the researchers recreated the results of the 1960s studies — in mice. To do that, scientists gave mice a dose of either live or dead Chlamydia bacteria. Later, they observed how the mice reacted to a second dose of live bacteria. As with the human trials, the animals that were given killed Chlamydia were far more likely to be infected than those that were given live Chlamydia the first time around. Then the researchers' task was to figure out why. A specific type of white blood cell, called a T lymphocyte, was responsive to Chlamydia, an immune system analysis showed. Live and dead bacteria elicited different immune responses from the T lymphocytes. T cells can become cells that fight the infection — protective T cells — or regulatory T cells, which protect Chlamydia, explains Ulrich von Andrian, an immunologist at Harvard University and co-author of the study. Dead Chlamydia exposure created regulatory T cells, making the infection more effective in the mice. ""When they're stimulated by Chlamydia, they can sort of make different career decisions,"" von Andrian says. Regulatory T cells are anti-inflammatory and they prevent other parts of the immune system from becoming fully active against an allergen. This is what happens with killed Chlamydia. And it's the reason the vaccines in the 1960s made everything worse.  Dr. Arum and N. Jacobs / CDC / Wikimedia commons    This was actually very good news for the researchers. It meant that the killed Chlamydia weren't being ignored by the immune system. This was something the researchers could use. ""We thought, perhaps we can exploit the fact that this killed Chlamydia is actually seen by the immune system and attach a message to this killed Chlamydia such that the response becomes a desired one,"" von Andrian recalls. To do that, the scientists tried to mix the vaccine with ""adjuvants"" — substances that are used in vaccines to boost body's immune response. The attempt failed miserably; the T cells reacted just as they had before. As it turns out, if you mix killed Chlamydia with adjuvant particles that are about the same size, you just end up with two particles floating around. And having them mixed together doesn't change the T cells' ""career decision"" to regulate instead of protect. So, the researchers turned to nano-particle science. Surgeons use tiny bio-degradable plastic materials, called nano-particles, to do things like make dissolvable sutures. So the researchers adapted the technology to attach the adjuvants directly to the vaccine. To do this, the researchers took advantage of a little-known fact. All living cells — including dead bacterial cells, for that matter — carry a negative charge on their surface. And a negative charge attracts a positive one. So, the scientists made nanoparticles with a positive charge. This time, the adjuvants stuck to the vaccine, and the  T cells chose more wisely. ""We got protection that is as good as, and perhaps even a little bit better than if we infected mice with live Chlamydia and let them develop natural immunity,"" von Andrian says. Now, here's where things get even geekier (read: awesome). The vaccine the scientists made works really well as a nasal spray. To understand why that is, you have to delve deep into immune system science. But here's a quick and dirty break down: If a doctor immunizes a patient by ""the classical route,"" where a doctor gives them a vaccine through the skin, their lymphocytes become ""educated"" to this vaccine. This essentially means that their lymph nodes — the place where lymphocytes are formed — get imprinted with a message that tells the T cells which tissues they should travel to. Protection that's ""a little bit better than if we infected mice with live Chlamydia."" So, when a doctor injects someone with a vaccine through their arm, lymphocytes that are formed at these nodes learn to migrate to the skin. But a uterus isn't covered in skin — it's covered in mucosa, the same moist tissue lining that's inside your mouth and nose. And lymphocytes that are educated to migrate to the skin, don't migrate to mucosa. That's one of the main reasons that making vaccines that protect against STIs is so complex. Fortunately, it is possible to teach lymphocytes to travel to the mucosa, instead of to the skin. Scientists can do that by giving a vaccine through the mouth, for instance. That's how oral vaccines trigger T cells that travel to the intestines, which are also lined with mucosa. And in the case of this chlamydia vaccine, a nasal spray could do the trick, von Andrian says. ""The [T cells] go to the naval cavity and to other mucosal surfaces and then they set up shop,"" he says. ""There are local signals that we don't understand yet in the tissues that allow these cells to become very long-lived."" When the researchers gave a nasal vaccine to the mice, they found that it was protective against chlamydia six months after the treatment. Vaccines that target T cells can't prevent an infection from occurring — but they can shorten the length of the infection and lessen its severity. But protecting mice against chlamydia isn't the same as protecting humans. So the scientists tried the vaccine on mice with human immune systems. These ""humanized mice"" are created by grafting human immune cells inside their bodies. Each mouse costs $1,000, so this part of the study didn't come cheap — but it paid off. The vaccine worked as well in these expensive mice as it did in conventional mice. ""That is really, I think, very encouraging that the human immune system even in this rather foreign environment of the body can respond to this vaccine and protect against this Chlamydia as well as the mouse immune system,"" von Andrian says. The study ""presents an excellent insight"" into the requirements for designing an efficacious chlamydia vaccine, says Joseph Igietseme, a chlamydia researcher at the CDC. This has been the subject of ""intense research investigation for over five decades."" But Igietseme says the most important part of the study is the new delivery system used to target Chlamydia — and he'd like to see more information on how it works, because it may aid in more than just chlamydia vaccines. It could be used against other infections that target the mucosa, or to design vaccines against diseases that aren't spread by infection. Now that the study has been published, a pharmaceutical company by the name of Selecta Biosciences will move ahead with the work. They'll be in charge of conducting a human trial in a few years. When that happens, the nasal spray could really come in handy; asking someone to use a spray is a lot easier than asking them to let researchers introduce a chlamydia vaccine inside their uterus. And the study published today will be central in getting a human trial through the regulatory process; von Andrian knows that the legacy of the 1960s studies will be hard to shake. ""There will definitely be questions,"" he says. ""Regulatory agencies wouldn't be doing their job if they didn't ask about this.""

Representatives from the Wildlife Conservation Society, the African Wildlife Foundation, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Humane Society of the United States, and the World Wildlife Fund were all on hand. The event was hosted in Times Square because it's one of the most-public places on earth — and also because of New York's long-standing ties to the ivory trade. I remember having the same thoughts as Meng's kids when I learned about animal poaching — specifically, hunting elephants to fuel the ivory trade — in elementary school years ago. As an adult I was aware that poaching was still a problem, but what I didn't realize was that elephant poaching has gotten worse.   It's hard to nail down exact numbers, but it's estimated that over 100,000 elephants were poached from 2011 to 2014, according to a study published last year in PNAS. That's the highest recorded level of African elephant poaching ever. An average of 34,000 elephants were killed each of those years, a significant portion of the 400,000 or so that live across the continent. ""Maybe more, because [poachers] are now going after the babies,"" Sally Jewell, Secretary of the Interior, said at the event. Ivory crushes have been going on for over 20 years, but the USFWS performed its first one in Denver in 2013. They crushed six tons of seized ivory at that event. ""That crush drew worldwide attention,"" said Dan Ash, director of the USFWS. ""It galvanized efforts here and abroad to tackle this problem."" It's expected that the Obama administration will announce new regulations soon requiring paperwork to verify the age of ivory in circulation. While trading has been illegal since 1989, older ivory is still allowed to circulate. Behind China, the US is the second largest ivory market. The crush isn't all the USFWS is doing, Ash said. The group will post law enforcement agents in poaching hotspots such as Peru, Tanzania, Thailand, Botswana, and China. They're not just looking for poachers — traffickers are also being targeted. Luckily, these agencies might have a new edge in their fight against poaching: researchers have found a way to locate where elephants are being slaughtered by matching DNA from their dung with confiscated ivory, according to a paper published in Science. Until now it has been hard to pin down trafficking routes. The researchers found that ivory is often shipped from countries different to where it was poached, and traffickers intentionally try to mislead authorities. By quickly analyzing the DNA of seized ivory, the hope is that law enforcement will be able to stop poachers more frequently.   The US Fish and Wildlife Service put one ton of items made from ivory on display before crushing them to bits. The event was held in Times Square. New York City has long been tied to the ivory market, and the United States is the second largest ivory market next to China. Much of the ivory that was crushed was confiscated in Philadelphia from the store of Victor Gordon back in 2014. Gordon was an art and antiques dealer who was sentenced to 30 months in prison and ordered to pay $157,500 in fines and forfeitures for smuggling African elephant ivory into the US. Other items were seized in New York City, which has long been a hub for the ivory trade. The first piece to go into the crusher was an in-tact tusk with ornate carvings. Representatives of the government agencies and wildlife organizations placed objects made of ivory one by one on a conveyor belt that ran up to the mouth of the rock crusher.  Sally Jewell, the United States' Secretary of the Interior, spoke to the crowd before the ivory was crushed. A few hundred people attended the event, and the crush drew plenty of on-lookers to the northernmost section of Times Square. The USFWS had other illegal trade items on display as well. ""It's not just ivory,"" said Dan Ash, director of the USFWS. He urged the crowd to ""stop the senseless deaths"" of other animals. A handful of celebrities were at the event, like Edie Falco. The reason for hosting the event in Times Square was to draw attention, and it did plenty of that. Even this tour bus guide joined in while stopped at a red light. He yelled: ""Stop animal poaching!"" The Trakpactor 260 is a 25-ton rock crusher typically used for recycling and demolition. Today, it chewed up ivory. The ""96 Elephants"" movement was started by the Wildlife Conservation Society. The name is a reference to the fact that an average of 96 elephants are killed each day in Africa. Many supporters attended the event, and their efforts were called out by most of the speakers. Representatives from the Wildlife Conservation Society, the African Wildlife Foundation, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Humane Society of the United States, the World Wildlife Fund, and even the New York State Environmental Conservation police were all on hand.   Celebrities, press, and guests were all invited. Several hundred people watched the machine pulverize the confiscated ivory.

The finding means that his genome —  the DNA analysis also identified him as male — is more Neanderthal than any other human sequenced to date. This is ""quite lucky and unexpected,"" says Qiaomei Fu, a geneticist at Harvard University and a co-author of the study, published today in Nature. A human ""this close to Neanderthals has not been found before."" Approximately 40,000 years ago, Neanderthals went extinct, but their DNA lives on. Europeans and Asians inherited between 1 percent and 4 percent of their genetic material from Neanderthals. This means that Eurasians probably had a lot more Neanderthal in them once upon a time; with each generation, the DNA that’s passed down from one ancestor is diluted. This gradual dilution is the marker that geneticists used to estimate the amount of generations separating this early European from his Neanderthal ancestors. Indeed, the surprising length of his Neanderthal-derived DNA hints that one of his ancestors probably had sex with a Neanderthal about 200 years before his birth.   Credit: Svante Pääbo, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology The study adds to our understanding of human interactions with Neanderthals. Chances are, interbreeding happened more often than previously thought. That said, the population to which this human belonged didn't go on to contribute much of its DNA — if any — to later Europeans. It’s therefore possible that he participated in an early migration of modern humans to Europe that interacted with Neanderthals, and eventually went extinct. A human ""this close to Neandertals has not been found before."" Scientists have named this human ""Oase 1,"" after the cave in which he was found. His genome raises a lot of questions, they say. For example, because interbreeding occurred 200 years before Oase 1 was born, the act of interbreeding must have taken place in Romania, explains Israel Hershkovitz, an anthropologist at Tel Aviv University who didn’t take part in the study. ""Yet there is no fossil evidence to suggest that Neanderthals were indeed present in Romania at this time,"" he says. And because we only have this one specimen to go on, it’s unclear how prevalent this individual’s genetic mixture was at the time. Still, interbreeding between humans and Neanderthals appears to have occurred at different geographical areas outside Africa and at different times, Hershkovitz says. Signs of interbreeding have been found in Siberia and in the Middle East. ""So it was not a Romeo and Juliet story,"" Hershkovitz  says — ""but rather 'one thousand and one nights' stories.""

According to People, the four remaining members of the world's leading boy band — that's Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, and Harry Styles — are planning an extended hiatus, one that's set to begin next March. The news is coming just six months after Zayn Malik announced his departure from the band, a decision he made so he could live life as ""a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time."" (Malik has spent the summer signing a solo deal with RCA and beefing with Calvin Harris on Twitter in pursuit of this elusive private time.) One Direction is still on track to release their as-yet-untitled fifth full-length later this fall, but they won't be touring to support the new music, and they'll be separated for at least a year once their remaining commitments are complete. The messaging surrounding the hiatus is entirely genial and hopeful, but precedent suggests this is the beginning of the band's end. And that's not surprising, either: gender-based pop groups aren't known for having long lifespans, whether the cause is individual ambition, larger market changes, fatal decadence, or some mixture of the three. The platforms that ensured the band's success also worked to drive them apart It's hard not to regard One Direction's impending hiatus as symptomatic of their status as the digital era's dominant boy band, and the insanely amplified workload that entails. They're the first pop group whose rise was assisted and powered by the internet and social media, and their insane work rate was necessitated by that changing media ecosystem, rather than just greedy handlers. Their success is unimaginable without platforms like Twitter and Instagram, but those same platforms drove an insatiable thirst for more content, more access, more One Direction that likely worked to drive the band apart. (To be more accurate, the open floodgates of the internet just made it easier for fans to dream their thirst could ever be sated — if you were getting all of your NSYNC information from monthly issues of Tiger Beat or the liner notes that came with one of their albums, there was no way you could keep that illusion alive.) If One Direction have indeed reached burnout level, that internet content-supply churn is at least partly to blame: even just by the numbers, the boys have put in more than their fair share of work in the past four years.    By the time they wrap their On the Road Again tour this October, One Direction will have played 329 live shows in just under four years. They built their fan base and weaponized their hair flips and charming stage banter with that year's worth of dates, but it came at a cost. Tours of the size and length One Direction typically undertake are grueling, complicated affairs, and you could see the toll they exacted on the band in Morgan Spurlock's otherwise jolly 2013 concert film One Direction: This Is Us. Tours feed the content grist mill when artists are caught between releases In an era where the content grist mill has to be continually fed to secure a star's place at the top, touring has a tertiary purpose beyond audience-building and profit: it keeps bands afloat between albums, serves to stitch together fourth and fifth singles, generates the last bit of momentum required before the next single is ready. Taylor Swift is executing this bit of strategy with ruthless precision as part of her 1989 tour: bring out a new batch of celebrities every few nights, keep your name in the headlines, and you never have to overcome static friction to promote a new single or LP. One Direction might not be bringing a crew of notables on stage every night, but their tours have served much the same purpose. The internet may have increased the strategic importance of touring, but it hasn't forced an increase in frequency. Most of One Direction's predecessors toured just as hard at their peaks, slogging through Europe, Asia, and the Americas every year or two like clockwork.   The video output of One Direction is the only place they've had it easy in comparison to other dominant boy bands, many of whom released far more videos in their brief tenures on top. (Look at the Jonas Brothers' 2009 — six videos! — compared to the solitary ""Drag Me Down"" video 1D has put out in 2015.) Some of this has to do with the contemporary devaluation of music videos: One Direction can get singles and albums on top of the charts with or without associated clips, and you couldn't have said the same for NSYNC or Backstreet Boys. But an average of four videos per year is considerable no matter the larger musical climate, and taken alongside their recording and touring pace it represents a major commitment on 1D's part. This is where the true insanity of One Direction's schedule really shows: if their fifth album is released later this year as planned, they'll become the first major boy band to release five albums in as many years. The only recent group that comes close to matching that level of studio productivity is the Jonas Brothers, who released four albums in four years between 2006 and 2009 before disbanding; their work didn't attain anywhere near the same level of domestic or international success. Other groups released three or four albums before splitting, and invariably took more time to do so: NSYNC, three in five years; Backstreet Boys, four in six; NKOTB and the Spice Girls, three in five. (And lest you think that the band's members spend weeks in the studio sipping lemon water and waiting to sing, they've been active participants in the songwriting and production process from the very beginning — they've written at least three songs on each of their four records, and many more on later ones.) No one in pop music works this hard The stats behind One Direction's ascent are impressive, even in the hyper-inflated sphere of boy band economics. When compared to their post-2010 pop contemporaries, they're shocking: no one in pop music works this hard, instead sucking every ounce of value out of each record before moving on. Anyone left dumbfounded by the band's upcoming split (whether temporary or permanent) just needs to look at the numbers they've put on the board since 2011. If you worked this hard for this long with the same three or four co-workers, you'd need a vacation, too.",0.754406560663512,0.24559343933648803,0.8481251997612808,1131,4.8213969938107866,590,5.977966101694915,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Music"

The cache of emails leaked by Impact Team shows that Bhatia told his colleagues that he had found a security hole in Nerve.com, an online magazine about sex, relationships and culture that had also launched a dating service, writes Krebs.

In a response to Motherboard, Avid Life claims that the conversation between Bhatia and Biderman was taken out of context. A representative wrote to Motherboard, ""Nerve was exploring strategic partnerships in May of 2012 and reached out to Noel to determine Avid Life Media's interest in the property. At the time Noel did not act on that opportunity."" Krebs, however, writes that Bhatia initially offered at least $20 million for the company along with a second property called flirts.com, but ultimately declined to pursue the deal. Avid Life Media earlier today put a bounty of $379,000 on the hackers’ heads, in response to two suicides that allegedly occurred as a result of the information leaked by the hackers.

Here’s how it works: start with a driver from Formula D, a professional drift racing league. Build him an absurdly heavy custom helmet with an Oculus Rift instead of a visor. Wire his car up with a directional sensor and a server. On that server, load a racing game built with custom-designed, hyper-realistic physics. Instead of a mouse and keyboard, feed all the car’s controls — steering, gas, brake — out to the game. Send your driver into the middle of a parking lot where a surveyor has spent days mapping GPS coordinates. Ask him to drive, wearing the virtual reality headset, until the sensor is too confused to know where he’s going. Stop him, realign the car, and do it again. Film the whole thing. Turn it into a 4-minute 360-degree movie. Then put that movie on the Gear VR and use it to advertise motor oil. Get all that? If not, that’s okay. Even in the world of experimental VR, “blindfolded drifting” stands out as particularly niche. But attacking a bizarre problem could help developers solve a much more mundane one — the question of how to blend the virtual world and the real one.   ""I love gaming, and I hate the idea of sitting in my room for months playing the same game,"" says Glenn Snyder, one of two designers that oil company Castrol hired to create its Rift drifting sim. ""I really want to go out in the real world and just modify the visuals a little bit, you know? Just see something different."" Along with fellow technologist Adam Amaral, he essentially created a video game tuned to mimic real life, hacking a Roush Stage 3 Mustang into a giant controller. Virtual Drift, granted, does more than change the world a little bit. Instead of a parking lot, pro driver Matt Powers sees what looks like a giant ocean made of coal, where waves and crumbling cliffs indicate that he should turn or slide. But the basic principle holds. The computer in Powers’ car tracks which direction he’s turning, how fast he’s going, and what kind of inertia he’s probably experiencing as he races across the lot. Existing location sensors aren’t fast or accurate enough to correctly plot where he is, so all this other data is used to estimate where he’s probably headed in the game. But unless those calculations are perfect, what’s happening on the course only matches the game for short periods of time. In order to translate Powers' driving into virtual motion, the team had to tweak a physics engine that — in other games — is basically meant to make amateur drivers feel awesome. Cars move faster, change direction at the tap of a button, and treat the conservation of momentum as more of a loose guideline than a law. ""When you play Grand Theft Auto or anything like that, you can basically flip the car back and forth and it'll just do whatever the heck you want,"" says Snyder. ""The PhysX engine's momentum is just awful."" That’s an especially large problem for drifting, says Ben Conrad, who directed the Virtual Drift video. ""It breaks physics. If we were doing laps, I think we would have been done. And then Matt gets into the car and starts doing countersteering."" Even in an Oculus Rift experience where players only move a couple of inches, the internal sensors or external tracking camera can make subtle mistakes. So your in-game perspective can slowly drift out of sync (no pun intended) — you might find yourself twisting your head to look straight forward in a game. Traveling longer distances amplifies this effect. Constantly changing direction amplifies it even more. While most games can pop the camera back in place without much trouble, reorienting the entire world around a car might be the ultimate form of distracted driving. And many of these problems didn’t come to light until Powers started actually test-driving the system. ""Three weeks out, we were like — it's done, it's good, we'll just hang out till the shoot date,"" says Snyder. ""Then we show up for the first testing, and we're like, 'Oh my God. Nothing's working.'"" So Powers ventured into a world that got further from reality by the second, just to measure how bad it could get. ""I'd listen to them — 'No, don't turn yet, you're fine, you're good, okay now turn.' But in the virtual world, I'm way off course,"" he says. ""The turn is still way up there, or I'd passed it."" Eventually, Amaral and Snyder matched the virtual and real controls well enough to last for a few minutes at a time. Between laps, Powers drove the car to marked GPS coordinates, so the team could figure out where he was and reset everything. ""We were just lining up landmarks so they can place me exactly in the virtual world where I am in the actual world,"" he says. Unfortunately, it can be hard to see all this work — and its results — in either Conrad’s YouTube short or the immersive Gear VR version. The video jumps quickly between an in-game view, a camera in the front seat of the car, and more traditional racing shots from outside. It’s pleasantly dizzying, but it doesn’t fully take advantage of VR’s greatest strengths — like its ability to make someone feel like they’re really in something that’s moving simultaneously through two worlds. The real draw is just the fact that Powers did it at all. Like so many other virtual reality experiences, Virtual Drift is unabashedly an advertisement. The technical pieces are largely hacked together, and it’s really more of a location extrapolator than a location tracker — in more concrete terms, imagine a VR system that guesses how the world should move based on how fast you’re walking, not where your head actually is. And companies like Google and Microsoft are already doing similar but far more advanced work in fields that range from augmented reality to robotics. Would the system, for example, be any good in Google’s self-driving cars? ""I think they're a little ahead of us,"" says Snyder dryly. ""Just a bit. They're pretty good."" Creating a cheap system that can make VR work over large distances at high speeds, though, is more than just a stunt. Even small-scale positional tracking took a long time to get right. Valve, for example, spent a long time working with QR code wallpaper before switching to the laser boxes it uses now. ""I feel like Valve has it down. Their laser tracking is on point,"" says Snyder. ""I'm really big on taking [VR] out of the world where it's small enough to use laser tracking, and bringing it out to just anywhere. Throw it in the back of a car, throw it on a skateboard or bike or put it in a backpack."" Very few people are willing to temporarily blind themselves on the road to see a different reality. But it’s symbolic of the weird, anything-goes place in which VR still exists. If things go well, maybe we’ll all drive with heads-up displays in 10 years. They’ll just rewrite the world instead of covering it up.… and they probably won’t fill everything with burning fields of coal.",0.1910824159310478,0.8089175840689522,0.1665955163256048,1234,4.7439222042139386,660,5.9045454545454543,0,0,"Transportation, Report"

The company will now compete for about one-third of these launches, as it apparently won't be able to launch the largest satellites until its bigger rocket — the Falcon Heavy — is built, tested, and certified on its own. The heated battle between SpaceX and the ULA gets hotter The battle between SpaceX and the ULA was heated long before today's certification. Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX's president, criticized the cost of the ULA's launches in front of Congress in March. ""I don’t know how to build a $400 million rocket,"" she said. ""Rather than [ask] how am I less expensive than ULA, I don’t understand how ULA is as expensive as they are."" In January, SpaceX settled a lawsuit against the Air Force that argued the ULA held a monopoly on the market. Another criticism SpaceX has parroted is that the ULA typically relies on Russian-sourced engines for its rockets, something that Congress says it won't allow past 2019. SpaceX, on the other hand, builds almost all of its Falcon 9 from scratch in the United States. The two companies are also essentially competing for the next International Space Station resupply contract that will be awarded in September, though Boeing and Lockheed Martin have submitted separate proposals. SpaceX and Boeing are also racing to complete the tests of their crewed spacecraft after they were awarded a split of NASA's ""commercial crew"" contract last year.

I walked past what seemed like 20 aisles of 100 cars each in the Avis section, eventually arriving at my ride for the week, a newer-model Mazda3. I just wanted to get going: I was exhausted, in the way a transcontinental flight exhausts you without even moving a muscle, and I was a little exasperated that my car was about as far from the garage's entrance as it could possibly be. (The perils of not being a Platinum member, or a Diamond member, or whatever it is they call you if you're a preferred rental-car client.) But it's not that simple, of course. You can't ""just get going."" There's a moment of adjusting mirrors and seats, a moment of familiarizing yourself with the car's controls, a moment of figuring out how to turn on the headlights without accidentally activating the windshield wipers. And then there's the uniquely modern phenomenon of pairing your phone to the car's built-in Bluetooth connection, because you'd rather hear your own music than try to suss out this exotic locale's best radio station. Furthermore, if you're navigationally challenged like me — or you've voluntarily ceded control of your life to algorithms, as Google would like us to do — you've also plugged your destination into your phone, because many rental cars still don't offer built-in navigation systems. My Mazda3 certainly didn't.  There's the uniquely modern phenomenon of pairing your phone to the car's Bluetooth connection By the time I was done futzing with the car — which has a cryptic settings menu kneecapped by its archaic, calculator-like LCD display — I think I'd been sitting in it for a good 15 minutes. A puzzled security guard clad in a bright orange safety vest peered through my windshield from a few dozen feet away, clearly wondering what was going on and why I hadn't left. I gave him a thumbs-up and a forced smile before diving back into the Mazda's controls. Cars don't have to be this complicated. And for over a century, they weren't! You had a steering wheel, gas and brake pedals, a gear shifter, and perhaps a radio. Navigation was done with a map, if it was done at all. But smartphones have changed us: for better or worse, they've become the most important inanimate objects in our lives. Through customization and use patterns, they've also become extensions of who we are — our personalities reflect on our phones, and vice versa. You don't have to look far beyond a colorful case or lock screen wallpaper to pick up on that. And we expect to have our smartphones — our little electronic personality boxes — at our sides, even when we're driving. That brings us to Android Auto and Apple's CarPlay, which together represent the Grand Unified Theory of the tech and auto industries: that by bringing the most critical elements of your phone to the dashboard, it's a win-win. Drivers stop looking at their phones and crashing into pedestrians and other drivers, often with tragic results; automakers finally capture the mojo of the smartphone revolution that they've almost entirely missed over the last decade; and tech companies finally find a home in one of the last stubbornly low-tech sanctuaries in our lives.   For some, these features, which will be almost universally adopted by major automakers over the coming year, will be taken for granted. They won't have a significant impact on car usage or on buying decisions — over a relatively short span of time, shoppers will simply come to expect that their next car supports native connections to their Android phones and iPhones. But for others, the commercial release of Android Auto in production cars represents the tip of a very, very long spear that will fundamentally change the way we think about car ownership. Cars have already been central to the development of the sharing economy, catnip to millions of urban millennials and their alleged desire to stop owning things — just look at the success of services like Zipcar and Car2Go, or Ford's announcement earlier today that it's launching a sharing service in London. But those same millennials have also grown up treating their smartphones like family members, and these two phenomena — the personal phone, the coldly impersonal shared car — are at odds. My experience with the Mazda3 at SFO is wholly indicative of that: the menus didn't make any sense, and nothing about the car felt connected to me, even once I'd managed to get Bluetooth connected. It's a bit ironic, really, that cars have become more complicated to learn just as we've become more willing than ever before to share them. The car doesn't have to belong to you Android Auto and CarPlay, in their small way, start to bridge this dissonance by making your car — any car — an extension of your phone. In turn, it becomes an extension of your personality. The car doesn't have to belong to you. That sounds almost silly; today, a car's typical Bluetooth connection makes the phone an extension of the vehicle, not the other way around. But that's changing. You can start to see how this all aligns: hundreds of thousands of anonymous cars, driven by millions of people for an hour or two at a time, are able to become personal again. It's not an overstatement to suggest that technologies like Android Auto and CarPlay (and their more feature-complete successors) will give these vehicles chameleon-like superpowers. When every car can feel like it belongs to you mere seconds after you get in and close the driver's-side door, owning your own car becomes a little less compelling of a proposition. Giving up on car ownership isn't for everyone, and it won't ever be: car-sharing doesn't work in rural areas, for instance, and it may not even work very well once Google and Uber get their armadas of self-driving taxis on the highway over the next couple decades. There'll also be enthusiasts (myself included) who are dead-set on owning their own car, even if it doesn't make good sense. But I'm willing to bet that extremely intelligent smartphone integration — personalization through standardization — is the tipping point for entire segments of the population.",0.49982103178860604,0.500178968211394,0.1548991643854326,1080,4.8777777777777782,562,6.2544483985765122,1,2,"Apple, Google, Mobile, Tech, Transportation, Editorial"

Though they’ve gotten better over the years, these systems have been almost universally terrible, with confusing interfaces, slow response, and an overwhelming number of options. As a result, the best in-car navigation and entertainment system is often the smartphone in your pocket. Google and Apple are well aware of this, and that’s why last year both companies announced new in-car systems — Android Auto and CarPlay, respectively — that use your smartphone for navigation and music, bypassing the car’s native user interface. The idea behind both systems is that if drivers are going to be using their phones for entertainment and navigation, they might as well use the displays and controls already built into their cars. And in doing so, Google and Apple can limit the dangers of distracted driving caused by focusing on a phone while behind the wheel.  Android Auto is finally rolling out to production cars, starting with the Hyundai Sonata. Android Auto does not fully replace the Sonata’s interface. Instead, it essentially runs as an app on top of it, launching when you plug in a compatible phone (Android 5.0 or newer) into the car’s built-in USB port. It turns the car’s infotainment system into the conduit for controlling Google Maps navigation, receiving messages, and playing music or listening to podcasts. It also lets you use Google’s voice search from behind the wheel, using the existing buttons and microphones already built into the car. I spent two weeks behind the wheel of a Sonata equipped with Hyundai’s optional Tech Package and Android Auto to see if this is the future of driving (before the eventual takeover of self-driving robots, anyway). There were some bumps along the way, but for the most part, if you use an Android phone, you’re going to want Android Auto in your next car.   Firing up Android Auto is easy. Once you install the app on your phone, you plug it into the Sonata, pair it over Bluetooth (which happens automatically and is required for phone calls), and press the Android Auto icon on the Sonata’s 8-inch resistive touchscreen. Next, you’re presented with a familiar, but stripped down version of Android. At this point, the phone itself becomes rather useless — its interface is completely locked out in favor of an Android Auto splash screen. Google wants you to do everything through the car’s controls when you’re driving, so you might as well put the phone in a cubby hole and forget about it. There are five panes to Android Auto: navigation, a phone dialer, information, media and music, and a diagnostic pane that can display the vehicle’s vitals like tire pressure or fuel efficiency. Hyundai is not supporting that feature, so in this car, the far right screen’s only purpose is to exit Android Auto back to the native in-car system. The navigation pane works exactly as you might expect it to: it provides you with all of the Google Maps tools available on your phone to get you where you need to go. It has traffic information, points of interest, and a dark mode for night driving. Entering in a destination can be done via voice or using an on-screen keyboard when the car is in park, and Google will provide information such as hours of operation and phone numbers for businesses. One tap on a phone number and you can call a restaurant to place a reservation, with the car acting as a giant speakerphone. There isn’t really anything missing from Android Auto’s version of Google Maps compared to what’s available on your phone, though for obvious reasons, it only provides driving directions, not mass transit or walking. Pinch to zoom actually works, despite the Sonata’s resistive touchscreen, and you can choose between an overhead 2D view or a follow behind 3D perspective. Navigation directions are blasted through the car’s speaker system, and the Hyundai has a special speaker in the center of the dash that’s designed to make sure the voice alerts cut through the din of road noise and climate control (the system will automatically lower the volume of music when providing an audio alert and turn down the air conditioning when it’s listening for a voice command). Android Auto’s dialer pane displays the call log from your phone as well as favorite contacts. Placing a call is as easy as tapping the number from the list, or you can pull up a standard dialer to input phone numbers manually. And, of course, you can press the voice button on the Sonata’s steering wheel or the Google button in the upper right corner of Android Auto to dial numbers by voice.   The fourth pane from the left is Android Auto’s media pane — it’s where you can play music or podcasts that are on your phone and have them come through the car’s audio system. The list of media apps that Android Auto supports right now is rather limited — Google Play Music, Spotify, Pocket Casts, and iHeartRadio are the highlights. (You won’t find Pandora, Rdio, or any app that supports audio books.) Notably, they all must conform to the same design and structure. Third-party apps are able to “brand” the media pane — Spotify’s player has an on-brand green play button, while Pocket Cast’s is red — but the same basic navigation remains the same no matter what app you’re using. That strict limitation is intentional: Google wants drivers to do most things using its voice search, so they’re not staring at the screen instead of the road. The design guidelines include a limit on how long a scrolling list (say, for artists or albums) can be in the media pane. I can’t scroll past the D’s in my Spotify library using Android Auto, locking me out of a large amount of music I might want to listen to in the car. Voice search for music can be used in third-party apps, but perhaps unsurprisingly, it works a lot better with Google’s own Play Music than with Spotify. I found the best approach was to figure out what I wanted to listen to before I got in the car and queue up those playlists in the app ahead of time, instead of trying to find something to play once I was already on the road. You can also skip tracks and control volume using the Sonata’s steering wheel controls. Android Auto’s most interesting pane, and the main reason you’d want to bother with it instead of just using Hyundai’s built-in navigation and music system, is the central information dashboard. It mimics Google Now on the phone, displaying cards for current weather conditions, upcoming calendar appointments, and recently searched locations (whether they were searched for on the phone, in the car, or on the desktop). These cards aren’t swipeable, nor can they be rearranged, but they do update based on your location and the time of day. If it’s 7AM and I just got in the car, the top card presented to me would be one-touch directions to the office; at 6PM, Android Auto would offer to provide directions home. Incoming messages are also given cards on the information pane (as well as pop up notifications in every other pane). Android Auto supports SMS and Hangouts messages, as well as a handful of third-party messaging apps, such as Skype, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Kik. (Line and Facebook Messenger are unfortunately not yet on the supported list.) With Android Auto, you can’t actually _read_ your text messages: tap a notification and the system will read the message aloud to you with its mildly charming robotic voice. You can dictate replies or start new messages using voice control, but you can’t browse messages that have already been read. Messaging with Android Auto can be hit or miss: it didn’t work very well with the default messaging app on a number of phones I tested, but it was pretty reliable with Google’s own Messenger or Hangouts apps. Still, it quickly became my favorite feature of Android Auto — hitting a button and dictating a short message was often much easier than calling someone and hoping they’d pick up the phone.   What you won’t get in Android Auto’s information pane are alerts for many of the other apps that ping your phone all day long. Email, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Candy Crush, or whatever else is hot at the moment won’t show up on the Android Auto dashboard, since they aren’t things Google thinks you should be using when you’re behind the wheel. This is where Android Auto is better than just using your phone for navigation and music — it prevents you from being distracted by the things that can wait until you’re done driving. But surprisingly, Google’s Voice Search feature is mostly unrestricted in the car. You can ask it almost anything you can ask your phone: What will the weather be like this weekend? Do I have any other appointments on my calendar today? Who won the 1983 World Series? Answers are dictated back, so you don’t have to take your eyes off the road to learn that the Baltimore Orioles beat the Philadelphia Phillies in five games. That kind of information isn’t exactly necessary when you’re driving, but that doesn’t make it any less fun. Most of the time, I didn’t have performance issues with Android Auto’s interface: switching between panes was responsive and there weren’t many aggravating delays when touching things on the screen, even though the Sonata has a resistive display instead of a capacitive one like a modern smartphone or tablet. But, performance can vary depending on the phone you have: a brand-new LG G4 worked much better than my year-old HTC One M8. Requiring Android 5.0 Lollipop for Android Auto eliminates a lot of older and low-end phones, but Google could do some work improving the consistency of Android Auto performance. The system’s capabilities are limited enough so that I wouldn’t expect a year-old phone to lag at all. Then there were the times the system would occasionally crash or not recognize that the phone was plugged in and refuse to launch the Android Auto dashboard until I rebooted the device. (The Bluetooth pairing came in handy here — even when Android Auto crashed, I was still able to answer incoming phone calls.) That isn’t exactly something you want to do in traffic or on a highway at 80 miles per hour. Additionally, even though the phone is plugged into a USB port the entire time, that doesn’t mean it was charging my battery — many times I would unplug the phone to find it very warm and at the same or less battery than when I started.   But despite those relatively minor complaints, when I got into my old Toyota Corolla after driving the Sonata for two weeks, I missed having Android Auto and all of the conveniences it afforded me. It let me use my phone in the car in a much safer and easier way than I’d been doing in the past with Bluetooth adapters and various dashboard mounts. I also found Android Auto to be a much more pleasant experience than Hyundai’s native system. It’s faster, gives me access to the same maps and music I use on my phone, and is just more pleasant and familiar to use. If I owned the Sonata, I can’t think of a reason why I’d use the native UI instead of Android Auto, warts and all. (I suspect this will be the case for many cars from many automakers that will be offering Android Auto in the months to come.) That really speaks to what Android Auto (and Apple’s CarPlay, which the Sonata will support later this year) actually is — a stopgap solution until we get to the point where the automaker’s native interfaces can be fully replaced by more intuitive and familiar ones, likely powered by our smartphones. Rumors are already circulating that Google wants to fully replace the existing in-car infotainment systems with an Android-based platform that even includes climate control functions. I’d be shocked if Apple wasn’t thinking about doing the same thing. But until we get there, Android Auto is a pretty great convenience to have. The distant future of the automobile might be the self-driving car, but the near future is already in your pocket — and it’s pretty cool.",0.60951833610304,0.39048166389696004,0.19280139238920382,2106,4.8380816714150043,839,6.2359952324195467,0,8,"Google, Tech, Transportation, Review"

The US Justice Department is the latest to provide policy guidelines on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). On Friday it published its guidelines laying out how federal law enforcement agencies may (and may not) use the remote-controlled vehicles. So far, the FBI is the only agency within the department to use the drones in missions. In a five page document, the department says that UAVs may not be used to monitor any activities protected by the First Amendment, such as peaceful protests and demonstrations. In addition, law enforcement must ""seek a warrant in circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy,"" consistent with the Constitution. Drones barred from monitoring Constitutionally-protected protests Even in cases where the use of UAVs is allowed, it appears the Justice Department is keeping a close eye on the use of drones in the US. The guidelines say that the devices ""may only be used in connection with properly authorized investigations and activities."" And each agency will be responsible for maintaining detailed logs of all UAV missions. The guidelines also call for yearly summaries to be submitted to the deputy attorney general for review. It also urges law enforcement to use the ""least intrusive means to accomplish an operational need,"" suggesting that UAVs aren't right for all missions. In addition, among other rules, all pilots will have to be certified and information and documentation generated from UAV missions will have to adhere to existing privacy laws.

In recent years, the most interesting and innovative work is coming from the fans, not traditional advertising departments. Through shows like Comic-Con and outlets like Mondo, talented artists and designers are creating wonderful posters that help fill the gap left by the drab marketing material put out by major studios. But it wasn't always that way. For decades, John Alvin crafted some of the most iconic images in Hollywood, and they were almost all destined for promotional posters. His work has included everything from Blade Runner and Star Wars to The Lion King and Jurassic Park. The films were often very different, but his approach was the same. ""Somehow, John was able to capture the emotion of an entire movie in a single image,"" says Dreamworks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, who worked with Alvin to help make Disney films like Beauty and the Beast appeal to adults as well as children. ""He loved finding that one image that evoked the element of the movie that would draw the viewer in and make them want to see the film,"" adds Andrea Alvin, his wife and design partner. That includes everything from the iconic touching fingers from the poster for E.T. to a hand rubbing a magic lamp in Aladdin.   Six years removed from his death in 2008, Alvin's work has been collected in a new volume called simply The Art of John Alvin, authored by Andrea. Unlike many artists, the creators of movie posters aren't always closely associated with their work, making this a rare opportunity to see his best stuff in one place. In fact, Alvin often wasn't allowed to sign his paintings, though he often snuck in an ""Alvin"" in hard to find places — you can find his signature hidden along a building in Blade Runner and on the surface of the Earth in E.T. The book not only collects some of his most important work in one place, but also includes many pieces that never made it into a marketing campaign. There are several unused sketches and paintings from Return of the Jedi, for instance, that were done so early in the process they still feature the original title Revenge of the Jedi. The iconic quality of Alvin's work is all the more impressive considering the constant limitations put in place by the movie business. He was given no story details when working on Return of the Jedi due to fears of story leaks, for instance. And when he put together a poster for Batman Forever, Alvin had to contend with the egos of the Hollywood elite — contracts stipulated that images of Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones had to be no smaller than 50 percent of star Val Kilmer. Nicole Kidman and Chris O'Donnell, meanwhile, had to be even smaller than Carrey and Jones. Despite the handicaps, the poster turned out fantastic. The Art of John Alvin is available on August 28th, and it's a wonderful celebration of an artist whose influence far exceeded his acclaim. Even if you've never heard his name , you almost undoubtedly have come across his designs.

The Alpha is an ultra-thin (6.7mm) Android phone with a 4.7-inch 720p display, 12-megapixel camera, a fairly small 1,860mAh battery, and (depending on your region) a quad- or octa-core processor. It'll be available in September, but Samsung has yet to announce pricing.  Perhaps more interesting than the phone itself is the news that the Alpha's design will trickle down and up to Samsung's other phones. Samsung calls the phone ""the evolution of Galaxy Design,"" adding that it showcases a ""new design approach"" for the company. That approach involves flat metal sides with chamfered edges, and not much else. The overall shape of the device isn't so different from the Galaxy S5, and the Alpha retains the S5's dimpled, removable back cover. The approach will allow Samsung to push out devices in a range of colors with minimal expense, and true to form the Alpha will be available at launch in black, white, gold, and blue.

Scientifically-minded parents and the young-at-heart may be pleased to know that NASA is working on a stunningly geeky picture book detailing the A to Zs of the Orion passenger module. Scheduled for its first manned flight in 2021, the capsule may one day be responsible  for placing astronauts on Mars. The simplistic yet eye-pleasing illustrations come with terse lines like, ""C is for Crew Module: a home far away from home for our astronauts,"" as well as more detailed explanations, including a short exposition on ""frangible joints."" According to its Facebook page, the agency is planning to eventually release a downloadable book and poster upon completion of the ""Orion A to Z"" project, which is currently at ""K"" for ""Kinetic.""   ""The term apogee refers to the point in an elliptical orbit when a spacecraft is farthest from the Earth. During Exploration Flight Test-1, Orion’s flight path will take it to an apogee of 3,600 miles. Just how high is that? A commercial airliner flies about 8 miles above the Earth’s surface, so Orion’s flight is 450 times farther than that."" ""When a spacecraft travels beyond Earth’s orbit, it travels away from the planet, instead of circling around it. Orion is designed for deep space missions to go beyond Earth’s orbit, like going to an asteroid or Mars. The crew module is powered by solar panels and batteries, allowing an unlimited power supply. Orion’s life support system recycles water and oxygen for the crew, which allows them to travel through space for months. Orion’s heat shield and crew cabin are also designed to shield the crew from the intense radiation encountered during deep space exploration."" ""The crew module is a transportation capsule that provides a living area for the crew, and storage area for supplies and research instruments. Orion’s crew module will carry astronauts on missions to destinations never before visited by humans and safely return them to Earth. The Exploration Flight Test-1 crew module will be the first Orion test vehicle sent into space."" ""The Delta IV Heavy is the rocket that will launch the Orion Spacecraft on its first trip to space, Exploration Flight Test-1, in December 2014. The Delta IV Heavy rocket is the largest launch vehicle available today capable of propelling more than 60,000 pounds of spacecraft and cargo to a high altitude orbit. Ultimately, Orion will launch atop NASA's Space Launch System (SLS). SLS will be the most powerful and proven propulsion system in the world and will begin launching in 2017!"" ""The ECLSS is a life support system that controls atmospheric pressure, fire detection and suppression, oxygen levels, waste management and water recycling. Orion’s ECLSS will support a crew for missions to deep space and will carry crews farther from Earth than ever before. The ECLSS for Orion consists of technology previously tested on the International Space Station. It will have to support the crew with the essentials like breathable air and drinkable water for 21 days all while fitting in a space smaller than a standard office cubicle!"" ""Frangible joints are breakable joints used to connect the spacecraft’s protective panels, called fairings, to the rocket. A structure is frangible if it breaks, distorts or yields on impact to minimize any hazard to the vehicle. The fairings protect the spacecraft from the changing pressures, temperatures and vibrations of the atmosphere surrounding the rocket during ascent. During ascent, about seven minutes into flight, the Orion spacecraft and launch vehicle will reach 135 miles in altitude. At this point, pyrotechnics will be used to break the frangible joints and separate the fairings, exposing the spacecraft to space."" ""The Super Guppy is a special airplane capable of transporting up to 26 tons in its cargo compartment measuring 25 feet tall, 25 feet wide, and 111 feet long. The Guppy transported Orion’s heat shield from the Boston area to Kennedy Space Center. In order to prevent the heat shield from cracking, it was shipped in a climate controlled container. The world’s largest whale, the blue whale, would fit inside the Super Guppy!"" ""A heat shield is a protective layer added to the crew module designed to shield the crew and spacecraft from the heat experienced during reentry into Earth’s atmosphere. One of the primary goals of the Exploration Flight Test-1 mission is to validate Orion’s heat shield and collect data on its performance as it experiences temperatures near 4,000°F. Orion’s heat shield is the largest heat shield ever constructed at more than 15 feet 5 inches in diameter."" ""Isogrid structure is created by removing material from a metal sheet, and retaining the stiffening ribs. This maintains the structural strength of the material while greatly reducing weight. By reducing the weight of the spacecraft structure, we can carry more supplies into space.  The pressure vessel used in Orion's crew module was assembled from multiple isogrid pieces welded together. Orion's isogrid was machined from solid pieces of an aluminum-lithium alloy. The barrel portion of the pressure vessel was machined from a single aluminum donut 139 inches in diameter."" ""Once Orion reaches orbit, its Launch Abort System is jettisoned or discarded, releasing the spacecraft into space. Prior to re-entry, the service module is also jettisoned. For Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1), you start out with the rocket’s port, starboard, and core boosters, the service module’s protective fairings, the launch abort system, the second stage/service module, and the forward bay covers…all of this is jettisoned so that only the crew module re-enters the Earth’s atmosphere and splashes down!"" ""Kinetic energy is the energy of an object that is moving. The amount of that energy is relative to the mass of the object and the square of its velocity. During Exploration Flight Test-1, Orion will be gathering more kinetic energy than any spacecraft has gathered in more than 40 years and must get rid of this energy during reentry for a safe landing. The Orion spacecraft sheds its kinetic energy by interacting with the atmosphere and deploying the parachutes. When Orion reaches the upper layers of the atmosphere, it will be travelling 20,000 mph. The interaction between the heat shield and the atmosphere will slow the spacecraft to about 300 mph before parachutes are deployed to further slow the vehicle to about 20 mph.""

Oscar, a New York startup founded in 2013, has positioned itself as a technology company disrupting the traditional offerings. It has managed to sign up over 40,000 clients, and today it's announcing a massive new funding round of $145 million that values the company at around $1.5 billion. ""We approach it with the goal of building a better user interface and giving people more access to the flow of information,"" says CEO Mario Schlosser. ""With other insurance companies, it is very hard to understand if you happen to be with a good doctor or exactly what benefits you have and how they work."" Oscar has slick website design and offers forward-thinking amenities. You can input your symptoms to its app and get suggested doctors, then start a teleconference with one click. Your recent visits, prescriptions, and lab work is all available in a handy timeline. The company will even give you a free fitness tracker so you can earn rewards for staying in shape and sharing that data with Oscar. Customer reviews of Oscar, however, have been decidedly mixed. There are some five-star reviews on Yelp praising the company as the antidote to the confusion and bureaucracy often found with insurance companies. But it's averaging three stars, with a number of angry one-star reviews going on at length about how impressed they were with Oscar's design, pitch, and packaging, only to feel let down or betrayed by the actual coverage. The biggest complaint seems to be that there is a very limited number of doctors in Oscar's network, and there have been reports that the company makes it difficult to understand when you are covered and when you're not. For now it seems Oscar is still constrained, at least some of the time, by the complexities and poor incentives that have bedeviled the US insurance market for decades.

That sounds pretty ambitious and expensive. Plus you get what arguably the best, or least the most flexible, data plan offered by anyone, even trumping T-Mobile’s ""Uncarrier"" approach. But building a mobile network is a massive expense. Is Google betting everything on this new project? Well, no. Instead of spending billions to create its own network, Google is piggybacking on Sprint and T-Mobile. It’s called an MVNO — mobile virtual network operator. The model has an up and down history in the US. Around 2005 every tech blogger worth their salt thought they were the next big thing. A few years later we were strolling through the MVNO graveyard (RIP Disney Mobile, ESPN MVP, Helio, and many more). The basic arrangement of an MVNO works like this: a big carrier sells its unused network capacity at wholesale prices to a smaller company that can capture a part of the market that is less profitable or more difficult to reach with its existing plans. ""It's a balancing act,"" T-Mobile’s Doug Chartier said back in 2013. ""In a perfect world, the MVNO uses enough network to create a contribution to the organization without being detrimental. That's the holy grail."" Making something of unused network capacity Typically, MVNOs have targeted lower income sections of the market, offering the ability to work with cheap monthly fees or pre-paid devices, but with less widespread coverage and without the ability to provide premier devices. Project Fi seems different, at least in the sense that you need to own an expensive flagship phone to participate and that it would work for global travelers in 120 different countries. But the basic principles still apply. Sprint and T-Mobile get to grow their subscriber base (although it's not clear how they will tally the shared customers), and in this case add early adopters who probably consume an above average amount of data each month. Google incentivizes people to rush out and buy a Nexus (I’m looking at you @backlon) and perhaps gets phone manufacturers to build more cross-network compatible phones to boot. More importantly — and maybe this is Google’s main goal, Fi could push the entire industry toward a model where data is cheaper and more abundant. Just look at the impacts Google Fiber service had on speeds and prices in cities where it was offered. Project Fi is starting with an ""Early Access Program"" and is only compatible with one phone, so you could argue that this program isn’t meant to make money. Sundar Pichai himself said, ""We don't intend to be a carrier at scale,"" and it seems like he meant it. Can Fi do for wireless plan what Fiber did for broadband plans?  If you’re looking at business motivations, it makes sense to see Fi as an example meant to pressure the actual, bigger players into acting in a way that is good for Google. The side benefit is that simple data plans, seamless Wi-Fi transitions, and low prices aren’t just good for Google, they’re good for consumers. From Fiber to Loon, Google has been operating across a wide range of new industries on the assumption that more internet access will benefit its business in the long term, especially if it plays a role in delivering that access. The gamble Sprint and T-Mobile are taking is that they can roll up some new customers, get a lot of free press, and associate their brand with Google and cutting-edge innovation. If Fi is a massive success and forces them to begin offering a competitive plan, well, they will cross that bridge when they get to it.",0.633124636454876,0.36687536354512396,0.17857907390363204,615,4.9056910569105687,371,5.881401617250674,0,0,"Business, Google, Tech"

Verizon wants to offer its customers a selection of slim cable bundles with its FIOS service. Disney says it violates their contract, specifically splitting off ESPN and ESPN 2 into a separate sports package. Verizon knows that, regardless of what the actual contract says, publicizing this offering is an easy win, so long as Disney takes the blame for not letting it happen. ""A way to give consumers what they want."" ""I think the right way to answer this without getting too public about our contractual situations –— look, this is a product that the consumer wants,"" Verizon CFO Fran Shammo said on the company’s earnings call. ""It’s all about consumer choice. I mean, if you look at the TV bundles today, most people only on average watch 17 channels. So this a way to give consumers what they want on a choice basis."" The bigger picture here is that the basic business model of cable, where consumers buy a giant bundle of channels, most of which they will never watch, suddenly seems on the verge of extinction. The rise of new options from Netflix, Amazon, Sling, Sony, and perhaps Apple in the near future has forced Verizon, typically not a company that rocks the boat, to acknowledge that consumers are coming to expect a new reality. A nation of cord cutters waiting for a savior This tectonic shift in the industry was not always so obvious, even in recent history. Let’s time travel back to November of 2012, when Nilay Patel wrote about a nation of cord cutters waiting for a savior. We all knew that the old model was broken. But at the time it seemed things weren’t likely to change. Between 1995 and 2005 the number of channels in the average cable bundle doubled in size and bills rose three times faster than inflation. FCC chairman Kevin Martin pointed out that ""the average cable subscriber was paying for more than 85 channels that she didn’t watch in order to obtain the approximately 16 channels that she does."" The problem was that the cash cow of cable TV was too good for the big-name brands like HBO and ESPN to endanger by breaking away, and that meant the oversized bundle of lesser channels was also here to stay. ""We have the rights to do it and we would do it if we thought it was in our economic best interest,"" Jeff Bewkes said on an earnings call back in the spring of 2013, but the market for a stand-alone HBO streaming service in the US was ""not significantly large enough to be attractive at this point."" As it turned out, the tide had already turned, we just didn’t know it yet. 2013 turned out to be a historic inflection point, the first full year in which the pay-TV industry lost subscribers. The losses widened in 2014. TV viewing, as measured by Nielsen, has been dropping at around 10 percent a quarter, a ratings plunge that has advertisers terrified. Not only was the number of pay-TV subscribers falling, but the customers that stuck around were buying much slimmer bundles. The end result was that ESPN, the top dog of cable, reached fewer homes by the end of 2014 than it did in 2010. This was enough motivation for the companies to finally take the plunge and start experimenting with streaming-only options. Cable's reach into American homes has been shrinking Over the last six months, a flurry of announcements have highlighted the tectonic changes that are reshaping the industry: HBO introduced a stand-alone streaming service. ESPN became available without a cable subscription as part of a slim package on Sling TV. Sony rolled out its Vue service on the Playstation. Apple is reportedly in the late stages of putting together its own streaming service that would feature very pared down bundles of premium channels, including ESPN, at a cost far less than the typical cable package. ""We had been waiting for multiple years for it to happen, but 2015 is finally the year of the virtual MVPD [multichannel video programming distributor],"" wrote Brandon Ross over at BTIG Research. We won’t see many channels beyond HBO who have the clout and audience to go it alone. But Ross says the market will increasingly splinter into skinny bundles available to anyone with an internet connection. ""We expect many more to come, targeting different groups and demos, each with a unique way of packaging its networks."" Networks will need to pick winners and losers We’re not going to get the nirvana of complete a la carte entertainment just yet. ""For the most part the content companies are going to keep bundling up networks together when they sell them,"" says Ross. But the bundles will slim down. ""They are going to have to pick winners and losers within their own portfolio, you’ve already seen that with Sling. Those that can’t make their way into the smaller bundles will die off. Who needs the military channel at Discovery?"" As some old cable networks fade, new ones may be born, like Vice, that originated on the web. The next few years will be a Cambrian explosion of options for watching TV , with many networks dying out in the process. ""We are at the tip of the iceberg. A lot of the deals you are seeing to make content available online in more complete and live, or live-like, packages, are laying the groundwork for a big unbundling,"" says Daniel Ernst, an analyst with Hudson Square Research. ""There are still risks. This year will prove to be the amoebae stage. What life forms come out of that, which live and die, we will see rapidly."" Can Apple accelerate the industry's transformation? Ernst believes one company in particular could lead the way. ""A lot of it really does depend on Apple and what they are able to put together. We saw a very similar thing 15 years ago with digital music."" It’s a company with the cash and cache among consumers to make a big bet on how we consume TV. It was the exclusive launch partner for HBO and is now reported to be preparing for a refresh on its Apple TV hardware. ""So far pay-TV has been coming apart slowly, a little trickle here and there,"" says Ernst. ""We’ll see soon if the dam is set to burst.""

The company, which reported its first quarter earnings today, now has 1.44 billion monthly active users, and 1.25 billion on mobile, an increase of 13 and 24 percent, respectively. A whopping 936 million people use it every single day. Facebook continued to cruise, posting revenue of $3.45 billion, up 42 percent over the same period last year. The shift to mobile continues, with 73 percent of its revenue coming from mobile ads as compared to 59 percent for this period last year. On the earnings call, Zuckerberg dropped one interesting detail. Facebook now sees over one billion searches on mobile every day. The company had net income of $1.19 billion, up 28 percent compared to $926 million for the first quarter of 2014. The company saw more than four billion daily video views.

As the Associated Press reports, users who open Instagram on the Koryolink 3G network have reported seeing a message that reads: ""Warning! You can't connect to this website because it’s in blacklist site."" A warning in Korean adds that the site contains ""harmful content."" The AP reports that the photo-sharing app was still usable on some mobile devices despite the warning, but posting photos or viewing user profiles was impossible on other devices connected to the 3G network. The warnings have also appeared when accessing Instagram on desktop computers with LAN cable connections. It's not clear what spurred the apparent blacklisting. Koryolink, North Korea's only 3G operator, says it wasn't notified of a change in policy, and the government has yet to issue a statement on the matter. There is speculation that the Instagram block may be a response to a fire that erupted this month at a popular hotel in Pyongyang. The incident wasn't reported by North Korea's state-run media, though images spread across social media.   A photo posted by Everyday DPRK (@everydaydprk) on Apr 24, 2015 at 12:47am PDT    North Korea is among the least-connected countries in the world, with internet access largely limited to top government officials, and strict censorship policies. But it has relaxed its controls for foreigners, who since 2013 have been able to access web on the country's 3G network and from their own cellphones. Social networks like Twitter and Facebook (which owns Instagram) remain accessible within North Korea, despite the apparent crackdown on Instagram.

For outsiders, Instagram has provided an important window into one of the world's most secretive countries. In recent years, a handful of tour guides, journalists, and other Instagram users have amassed major followings on the social network, with photos of everyday life that add an important counterweight to the propaganda published by the regime of Kim Jong-un.

If they are one of the lucky people who have access, they'll swoon about its fantastic speeds. If not, you'll hear tales of frustration about fruitlessly waiting years for FiOS to make it to their doorsteps. It wasn't supposed to be this way. When the City of New York signed a franchise agreement with Verizon to build out its fiber-optic network across the five boroughs, everyone — or nearly everyone — was supposed to be able to sign up for FiOS by 2014. The deadline has come and gone, but millions of New Yorkers still say they can't order FiOS in their homes. Now, New York is calling out Verizon for failing to hold up its end of the deal. An audit published this week by Mayor Bill deBlasio's administration and the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) highlights ""an egregious failure on the part of Verizon to deliver on the FiOS agreement."" Verizon, meanwhile, claims it has fulfilled its contract with the city. ""An egregious failure on the part of Verizon to deliver on the FiOS agreement."" The disagreement, primarily, comes down to some vague wording in the original agreement. Verizon was obligated to ""pass all households"" with its fiber-optic network, a phrase that means that network must go by all dwellings in the city, but not necessarily connect to them. Verizon says it completed its rollout across the city, after some delays, in November 2014. But the audit paints a different picture. As determined from on-site inspections, DoITT says that blocks that Verizon claims are ""passed"" with FiOS actually lack the requisite equipment to deliver service. In addition, the audit finds that Verizon ""systemically failed to meet its six-month and 12-month deadlines to fill non-standard installation orders for service to residential buildings."" The 2008 franchise agreement mandated that Verizon complete requests to connect buildings to the fiber-optic cables in the street (called a non-standard installation) within a year at the very most. There are more than 40,000 such requests that are still outstanding, according to the audit, and over three-quarters of those have been on the books for over a year. Verizon continues to tell customers that FiOS is unavailable in their area  There would be likely far more unfulfilled requests were it not for another shady Verizon practice unearthed by the audit. According to DoITT, Verizon continues to tell customers looking for service that FiOS is unavailable in their area, while simultaneously claiming that those areas have been successfully ""passed"" with fiber optics. In certain areas, the company appears to have taken the position that it is not connecting any more buildings with non-standard installations, even though it is required to do so under the agreement with the city. Verizon claims, as it has for years, that delays in bringing FiOS to buildings and residences are due to issues with landlords. In a statement provided to The Verge, a representative says, ""The challenge we have is gaining access to properties which of course would expand availability. We look forward to working with the City to seek solutions to this issue."" The company says some landlords won't let Verizon workers enter the property and perform the construction necessary to bring in service. But the agreement gave Verizon the right to petition a state commission and order uncooperative landlords to grant access to multiple-dwelling properties. Verizon has hardly exercised that right, and has only filed 3,177 such requests, according to the audit. In addition, Verizon rejects most of the audit's findings. ""We disagree with many parts of the report. The review was based on erroneous factual conclusions and incorrect interpretations of the agreement,"" the company says in a statement. The company has published a lengthy response to the report, attached at the end of the DoITT audit. It largely disputes the terms of the agreement with the city, and claims that Verizon has held up its end of the deal. Verizon, for its part, also says that the audit is merely a political play. A representative says in a statement that ""it is important to note that it’s not a mere coincidence that the report is made public today, and labor negotiations with our largest union begin on Monday."" The statement continues, ""It’s well known the union has ties to the city administration, and things like this are a familiar union tactic we have seen before."" The company's negotiations with the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and the over 39,000 workers represented by them, are set to begin next week. The city and the deBlasio administration deny that the audit is related to the union negotiations, reports The Wall Street Journal. As a result of the audit, the city has threatened to sue Verizon for breach of contract, but it isn't going down that road just yet. Instead, the city plans to work with Verizon to help facilitate the task of completing the FiOS rollout. City officials believe that bringing high-speed broadband access to all five boroughs — and introducing competition to legacy providers Time Warner Cable and Cablevision — is a top priority.

It's a neat trick, but not one that Facebook's European users will be able to try out: the social network has said that Moments won't launch on the continent due to worries that European regulators will object to its use of facial recognition. ""We have to offer an opt-in choice to people."" ""Regulators have told us we have to offer an opt-in choice to people to do this,"" Facebook's head of policy in Europe, Richard Allan, told The Wall Street Journal. ""We don’t have an opt-in mechanism so it is turned off until we develop one."" Allan adds that there's currently no timeline for Facebook to develop such an option. European regulators' dislike of facial recognition is well-established, with Facebook previously forced to withdraw the technology for European users on its main site in 2012 after an audit by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner. At the time, Facebook said it hoped to reintroduce the feature ""once we have agreed an approach on the best way to notify and educate users,"" but judging by the roll-out of Moments, it seems that whatever efforts made since then haven't been enough. The social network isn't alone in facing restrictions in this area, though: Google's recently-launched Google Photos app — which uses facial recognition to sort snaps by who's in them — also limits its use of the technology to the US. At the moment, America seems to be relatively accepting of facial recognition, but as the technology becomes more widespread and more accurate, it's possible that popular opinion will change. Earlier this week, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (a digital rights nonprofit) and eight other privacy advocacy organizations withdrew from talks with US law enforcement aimed at establishing a code of conduct for the use of the technology. ""People should be able to walk down a public street without fear."" ""At a base minimum,"" wrote the groups in a public statement, ""people should be able to walk down a public street without fear that companies they’ve never heard of are tracking their every movement — and identifying them by name — using facial recognition technology."" In a blog post, the EFF noted that it was ""especially concerned about commercial use of face recognition because of the possibility that the data collected will be shared with law enforcement and the federal government."" The organization noted that the FBI's standard warrant requesting data from Facebook asks for copies of all the images the user is tagged in, but that in future, this warrant might instead just request the ""underlying face recognition data.""",0.540002689735227,0.459997310264773,0.9079646630735861,465,5.0623655913978496,266,6.007518796992481,1,0,"Google, Mobile, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World"

Stewart lamented America's inability to confront the ""gaping racial wound that will not heal, yet we pretend doesn't exist,"" with Butterfield adding: ""Acknowledging that we still have a very, very long way to go is literally the least anyone could do.""

Acknowledging that we still have a very, very long way to go is literally the least anyone could do. Butterfield's series of tweets also called attention to the problem of structural racism in the US, and how, as a white male, he's never had to consider that he might ""die, or even be in danger, after getting pulled over by a cop."" The magnitude of the ""acceptable injustices"" is today much smaller than it was. But the sum of all of them is something I cannot imagine.  It's never once even occurred to me that I might die, or even be in danger, after getting pulled over by a cop.  I've never had anyone not want me to swim in their pool, use their bathroom, sit next to them on the bus, or be friends with their kids.  I've never left a job interview or an investor pitch or a blind date wondering whether I was being judged for myself/my merits. Butterfield commented that although ""WSJ editorials are meant to be spectacle ... there's a difference between their normal obnoxious horseshit & this one."" He concludes: ""It is obvious that this privilege is not equally distributed. The thousand little obstacles are constant & very real for many. And so is a racist sociopath with a gun. That's real. And the differential in where the cops' bullets land.""  It matters how we talk about it after & it matters that we at least try to make some progress.

It's called ShotSpotter, and it's already in use across several cities across the US, including New York, Washington, DC, San Francisco, Oakland, Minneapolis, and more. And that's what it's designed for — even wealthy cities like New York have only deployed the system in high-crime precincts that see frequent episodes of gunfire. The Newark Memorial High School is just the second educational institution in the country to install the system — ShotSpotter went live at the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2014. A few other schools have installed similar, competing systems to ShotSpotter. The system was installed last month, well before a high-profile mass shooting in a Charleston, South Carolina church last week that has reignited the gun control debate in the US. System was originally designed for militaries and police forces, not schools The school hasn't disclosed how much the installation costs, but it reportedly totals less than $20,000. The school district's superintendent explained the decision to the Contra Costa Times: ""We look at this as the next wave of student and staff safety."" He added, ""Being right in the heart of Silicon Valley, we're proud to be the first high school to implement this cutting-edge technology and we believe many others will follow."" ShotSpotter, notably, is also based in Newark, a city which is not known for issues with gun violence. The system works by using sets of microphones arranged around city blocks or, in this case, the roughly 25 buildings scattered around the high school's 44-acre campus. If three different microphones pick up the gunshot, the shooter's location can be triangulated. After a firearm is picked up by the system, an alarm and the location of the shot is sent immediately to authorities. By notifying the police immediately and providing continuously updated locations to assist with the search for the shooter, officials hope they would be able limit casualties were an attack ever to occur.",0.6436093494733433,0.35639065052665675,0.8641210130855002,345,5.1768115942028983,224,6.03125,0,0,US & World

In law, with great power must come great responsibility Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment concerned Kimble's webshooter invention, a glove that shot foam string from its palm much like Spider-Man, which he patented in 1991. Marvel purchased the patent in 1997, and agreed to pay Kimble in royalties indefinitely. However, after discovering the 1964 Supreme Court decision Brulotte v. Thys, which determined that royalties need not be paid after a patent expires, the company stopped paying Kimble in 2010. Kimble thus sued Marvel, and brought the case to the Supreme Court late last year. However, the highest court in the land ruled in favor of Marvel, stating that Kimble's arguments to view his patent in light of modern competition law were overall invalid. However, Justice Elena Kagan peppered the Court's decision with a few fun references to superpowers, the '60s Spider-Man animated series, and one of comics' most famous adages:   Justice Samuel Alito, who offered the dissenting opinion, failed to say ""It's Clobberin' Time"" when arguing to overturn the Brulotte decision.

It was the first of three scheduled livestreams exploring the world of The Taken King, which is set to expand and completely overhaul Destiny when it's released on September 15th. (It's different from The Dark Below and House of Wolves, the two small DLC packs released in the year since vanilla Destiny's launch last September.) The stream featured executive producer Mark Noseworthy, senior design lead Tyson Green, and community managers DeeJ and Cozmo, and it focused on the mechanics of character development and the refinement of core gameplay elements rather than new environments or the game's narrative. Bungie has had its ardent fanbase hooked on a slow drip of details since the expansion's reveal at E3. The Taken King was further fleshed out by a mammoth Game Informer cover story and related online updates, but the Twitch stream officially confirmed some features and paths that fans have been speculating about for weeks. Here's a quick review of those changes:    1. Levelling is easier to understand If you've played a lot of Destiny before The Taken King, you can probably recall the moment where you first puzzled over the game's bizarre levelling system. Vanilla Destiny players advanced through earning experience until Level 20, at which point any changes in their level became tied to their gear. Pieces of armor had Light values that were added together to yield some total, meaning that your level — and thus your effectiveness against the game's toughest enemies — was tied up in the armor you were wearing. Light and level are now completely separate This was a source of immense confusion for players, and the system has been simplified for The Taken King. Players can now reach the new level cap of 40 through earning experience — completing story missions, going on patrols, running strikes, playing against others in PvP, and other standard activities. Light still exists, but it's an indicator of overall strength rather than something that impacts players' access to content. (It now factors in the strength of your weapons, class items, and Ghost shells rather than just your armor.) Bungie described its impact on player strength as ""more granular."" If you attained a certain level using Light in vanilla Destiny, it'll be ported over to the same XP-related level once you hop into The Taken King. Your new Light level will be automatically determined by the contents of your inventory and vault, and Bungie has recommended waiting to dismantle anything until that level has been calculated. 2. Weapon stats, slots, and special skills have been recalibrated I hope you're not too attached to weapon damage and defense figures reaching the mid-hundreds, because those numbers are going to change. The armor and weapon damage values that characterized vanilla Destiny have been knocked down by over half, and they've been aligned so that weapons and armor with the same attack / defense values are roughly equivalent in terms of strength. (One of Bungie's streamers said it's like ""switching to the metric system."") A lot of gear will still be available at level 20, but much of The Taken King's new armor and weaponry will be locked until players reach the new level cap. Strength, intelligence, and discipline have been newly tiered and separated from percentages, and looking at them will tell players their exact impact on cooldowns. The Winter Sky Shell is ""for Ghosts who feel blue"" Class items and Ghost shells now contribute to attack and defense as well, and they've been granted specific perks that impact gameplay in new ways. An example is the Winter Sky Shell, with flavor text ""For Ghosts who feel blue""; it aids XP and / or reputation gain, and other shells do too. Other armor pieces have also been given newer, more specific perks. There are also new ways to extract value from unwanted armor and weaponry. Legendary armor will yield Legendary Marks when dismantled, and legendary and exotic weapons and armor can be upgraded through Infusion, which lets you ""consume a more powerful weapon to boost the attack value of [a] weapon."" 3. Get ready to flip through Exotic blueprints  Exotic weaponry is changing in a major way in The Taken King. The Tower is full of terminals that contain a catalog of every exotic you've found, information that spans your whole account. New exotic weapons can be built using exotic shards and a small amount of Glimmer. Some exotic weapons from vanilla Destiny can be upgraded to the new maximum attack value right away, but others will be left behind at their old attack values. Finally, exotic items now have their definitive perks unlocked right away — you won't have to grind and grind just to discover what makes a given weapon special or powerful.     4. Currencies and reputations have been simplified Bungie's heard the sob stories about PvE-dominant players staring longingly at Lord Shaxx's sexy Crucible-specific gear, and it's here to help. Vanguard and Crucible Marks — the high-value items used to buy legendary weapons and armor in the Tower — have been combined into a single item, Legendary Marks, and they can be used at any of the Tower's retailers. Upgrade materials have also been scaled back, with all three class-specific materials now folded into a single collectible. (Goodbye, Sapphire Wire! So long, Plasteel Plating! Good riddance, Hadronic Essence!) Players' wallet of marks is still capped at 200, but the weekly earning cap has been lifted — you can earn as many as possible in a given week. Players can also pledge their allegiance to one of the game's factions — there's New Monarchy, Dead Orbit, and the Future War Cult — by paying with Glimmer where they once had to wear a faction-specific item. (You can only change allegiance once a week, and you can only hold one at a time.) You can now earn faction reputation and Vanguard / Crucible reputation at the same time, a major change from vanilla Destiny's exclusivity, and reward packages earned by increasing rank have been improved too. There are also faction-specific quests unlocked by achieving certain ranks. The Gunsmith's finally good for something other than fusion rifles The Taken King's also introducing some new reputation receptacles, most notably the Gunsmith. Once a meaningless purveyor of sub-standard weapons once you surpassed Level 20, he's been revamped and turned into a regular source of legendary weapons. You can field test weapons, which means ""renting"" them from the Gunsmith and completing a task; doing so gives you a small amount of reputation. Once you've earned enough favor, you can participate in Armsday, a weekly legendary weapon delivery from one of the three new weapon foundries (Suros, Häkke, and Omolon). 5. I hope you like quests Vanilla Destiny had many problems — and if you're even the slightest bit familiar with the game, I'm sure you've heard all about them — but none more glaring or befuddling than its terrible story. The game tossed you into a vast universe and gave you insane powers and weaponry, but didn't bother to explain how you obtained them or why you were important; its most infamous scene involved a character — named ""The Stranger!"" Seriously! — telling your nameless hero ""I don't have time to explain why I don't have time to explain"" before vanishing into thin air. I'm honestly still not sure why the game's called Destiny in the first place. You just had to get used to Peter Dinklage's robot monotone and accept that you'd spend hours killing bad guys while he opened doors for you, without a scrap of justification or explanation. The game is finally putting its voice talent to good use Bungie knows this is a problem, and it's reframing the entire game's narrative around quest lines with The Taken King. This is a change that's going to apply to existing content, too: if you've ever wondered about the lore behind becoming a Bladedancer or the significance of the Crucible, it's going to be explained through a quest now. Much of the new content in The Taken King will only be accessible through the completion of multi-stage, lore-rich quest lines, and it'll be paired with new cutscenes and increasingly rich characters. Destiny's finally putting that army of quality voice talent to good use! 6. Bounties are different too Bounties have been revamped to reflect actual play patterns — you won't have to beat the same boss over and over again just to earn a small bit of experience. Players can track up to four bounties, and doing so will show progress on those bounties when they pull up their Ghost during gameplay or in the Tower. You can also cash in your bounties from the pause screen, a change that's surely going to eliminate millions of extra trips to the Tower every day. More vendors have bounties that are specifically tailored to their function, and there's a new level of differentiation between daily and weekly bounties. Bungie's team of streamers looked at a selection of weekly bounties that had to do with PvP play, and revealed a special bounty that's completed by finishing a certain number of weekly bounties. If you manage to fulfill that special bounty, you'll have access to unknown ""Nightfall-tier"" rewards.     7. You can give your character a little boost Players who purchase The Taken King will be given a ""Spark of Light,"" a new item that lifts characters to level 25 and outfits them with ""appropriate gear."" It also unlocks The Taken King's campaign. The item can't be used on characters above level 25, but it'll allow new players to jump right into the new game's action rather than forcing them to work through all of vanilla Destiny. (They'll still be able to do that if they want, though.) 8. Appearance stuff and Tower reorganization Bungie is making a whole host of minor changes to the Tower's organization and to player appearance. You can now choose the weapon you want your character to carry in the Tower, and you can look at your face without a helmet on the equipment-centric pause screen. Emblems, shaders, and ships are now contained within terminals throughout the Tower, and they track your acquisitions over time. If you delete one of those items, you can acquire it again through those terminals. Factions now allow players to exchange materials for reputation, a quick and easy way to turn some excess armor materials into a higher rank. The Cryptarch will finally give you something useful  Some vendors have moved, and others are selling new items — for example, the Speaker now sells Ghost shells in addition to his existing class items and material exchanges. Finally, some vendors have been tweaked to offer more deterministic and endgame-appropriate rewards. The most notable example is the notorious Cryptarch, a mysterious magician who's ripped off millions of players over the course of his year in the Tower. He now sells legendary engrams for Legendary Marks, allowing players a guaranteed legendary item and a chance at an exotic item. 9. Vault space — yes, really Devoted Destiny players have been screaming about vault space for months. Many of them have earned so many exclusive or rare pieces of weaponry and armor that they have to cycle them between characters — there just isn't enough storage space to accommodate them all. Bungie is trying to remedy this by doubling the vault space for both weapons and armor, a move that should satisfy all but the game's most devoted players. Playing The Taken King won't bring back Dinklebot or earn you a shiny new Gjallarhorn, but it should make for a radically different — and more satisfying — Destiny experience.",0.6355624557568034,0.36443754424319663,0.43625226447609294,1989,4.9527400703871294,861,6.3658536585365857,0,4,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming"

If you're not acquainted with the MTV ""Song of the Summer"" Video Music Award, that's because they just invented it yesterday. Twelve songs were nominated for the new award, and voting is being conducted using designated hashtags that can be deployed via Twitter or Instagram up to 12 times per day, per voter. 5 Seconds of Summer's ""She's Kinda Hot"" is soundly in the lead, despite the fact that its video is the only one nominated that has a mere seven-digit view count on YouTube (excepting Fetty Wap's ""My Way,"" which does not actually even have a music video). It is also the only nominated song that doesn't appear on Spotify's Top 50 list for daily streams, one of only two nominated songs that doesn't appear on Apple Music's Top 100 list, and has the lowest peak Billboard ranking of all 12 nominated songs. It's quite obviously not the song of the summer I'm not sure how to prove this other than anecdotally, but it's not getting any radio play at all, it's not the song you hear bumping out of car windows in Brooklyn, and it's not likely to be on any of your beach bonfire playlists (unless you're me). In other words, it's quite obviously not the song of the summer by any metric or stretch of the imagination. And yet, despite the fact that Taylor Swift herself tweeted out an endorsement for ""Good for You"" by Selena Gomez, it was #ShesKindaHotVMA that I saw in my trending bar all day long yesterday. The teens have come together, and they're strategizing. This kind of coordinated effort via social media is the type of thing that only teens (girls, mostly) have the free time and give-a-shit nature to pull off, so it makes sense that we're seeing their voice come through most loudly in this particular contest of affection. If voting for all major awards was handled this way, we would have a virtual utopia of entertainment being respected solely for its service to young women and their reciprocal love for it.

Learn more. I wouldn’t necessarily say I was excited about seeing Hitman: Agent 47. I wasn’t a fan of the original Timothy Olyphant movie adaptation, and the game series always seemed to aim for the basest of instincts: you play a genetically engineered assassin known only as “47,” and as such you basically, well, kill a lot of people. But I liked star Rupert Friend in the last few seasons of Homeland well enough, and with Zachary Quinto (Heroes, Star Trek) on board there seemed to be a slim possibility that this would be some sort of elevated entry into the series.  Neither that thin thread of optimism nor the Ketel and tonic I had beforehand did much to help when Hitman: Agent 47 began its bloody, unbearable, and often laughable 90-plus-minute parade of violence and direct-to-video drama. It wasn’t just that the premise was tripe — Hannah Ware plays Katia, a young woman who has been obsessively searching for a strange man that she can’t quite remember, only to discover that he is the key to a dormant genetic engineering program; with both the mysterious Syndicate International and our bald assassin 47 in the hunt for the same man, she soon gets caught in the middle — it was the execution. Halfway through, amidst a barrage of cringe-worthy dialogue, incomprehensible action set pieces, and incoherent dramatic turns, I started thinking, “Surely, somebody could have done better than this.”   And then I had the thought that every critic has had while watching a Hitman movie: “Hell, I could do better than this.”   So after the screening, I went home, furiously started typing, and as the sun came up, I had a first draft of my own spinoff, titled Hitman: Bloodtribution. To be frank, it’s pretty damn awesome — my Agent 47 is an aging assassin, in a role that would be perfect for a Patrick Stewart type — but I wanted to find out what you, The Verge readers, thought. So I’ve rigged up a little quiz below, full of dialogue, scene descriptions, plot snippets, and some really sweet techno-phrases. For each question, you’ll be able to pick between two options: one will be from Hitman: Agent 47, and the other from Hitman: Bloodtribution.

Nvidia knows both are growing in importance, and today it's introducing new software that upgrades the ease with which players can do both. I tried Nvidia's updated GeForce Experience — which is being rolled out in beta form today — at Gamescom earlier this month, and I came away impressed by the simplicity and quickness of the graphics company's new software.  Effortless and foolproof Today's update introduces an on-screen overlay that will be available across all games and requires no setup or tinkering. It's just there if you want it, accessible via a keyboard shortcut, and entirely unobtrusive if you don't. The first two options, instant replay and video recording, are basically Nvidia's ShadowPlay functionality presented in an easy and straightforward format. You can let your Nvidia GPU run its own DVR service in the background, automatically recording the last 30 seconds (or as long as 20 minutes) of gameplay and then making them available for immediate replay when something sublime happens in the game. Or you can manually set up a recording of an unlimited length. These options max out at 4K resolution and 60fps, which equates to roughly 60GB of data per hour. The next step is where the sharing aspect comes in, and the GeForce Experience overlay makes it very quick and easy to trim and upload a replay to YouTube. Anyone who's interested in doing gameplay walkthrough or tips videos for YouTube will immediately appreciate how frictionless this is. Again, there are no profiles or per-game settings to mess around with. You just jump in, do stuff in your game, and you immediately have high-quality replays to share with the world as you desire.   Nvidia differentiates between the two types of game streaming by designating the passive version as broadcasting. This makes a lot of sense to me and I hope others embrace the nomenclature as well. In this beta version, you can only broadcast your game to Twitch, though Nvidia is looking into the possibility of expanding these options in the future. Once again, the emphasis is on quick access, and you only need one click (on a button titled ""Start"") to get your game running live on your Twitch channel. A Chrome plug-in will let you jump into friends' games Game streaming in Nvidia's parlance is the actual conveying of the game to remote devices, and it is the fourth major option in the new software. You can invite friends to join your game, either via email or a shareable URL, and once inside they can either watch, play in your place, or play alongside you in co-op games. This is all done at a set resolution of 720p and 30fps, and the receiving party needs to be running a Chrome browser plug-in on either a PC or a Mac (no Chromebook support, unfortunately, owing to a slightly different decoder). I experienced this first-hand at Nvidia's Gamescom HQ and found zero latency. Admittedly, it was between two machines sitting side by side on the same wireless network, and the demo title of Trine 3 isn't as dependent on quick reactions as a first-person shooter might be, but even with those disclaimers, it was an impressively fluid and fault-free demo of game streaming. Nvidia set itself the goal to make its various behind-the-scenes streaming and recording capabilities more accessible and comprehensible to a much wider audience of gamers, and I think it's succeeded. The menu you're presented with now is one that regular humans can read and grok immediately. ShadowPlay could mean a million different things, but everyone has a pretty good idea of what an instant replay is. PC gamers need this sort of unified, game-agnostic streaming solution to compete with their console brethren, and so long as you're happy with Nvidia's graphics cards, using its GeForce Experience to take care of your streaming needs seems like an easy and obvious win.",0.5464121080563226,0.45358789194367743,0.17599154771991857,704,4.9048295454545459,390,6.0153846153846153,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Hands-on"

For a production company that's looking to get into the virtual reality game but doesn't necessarily want to go the DIY route, this could be the best option.   Odyssey is the first camera rig built specifically for Google's Jump platform, which was also announced at this year's I/O conference. Jump is an entire virtual reality ecosystem that, in theory, will make it easier to both create and consume VR content. With Jump, Google created open plans that companies can use to build their own 16-camera rig (GoPro just happened to be the first), as well as assemble software that can recreate the scene being captured in much higher quality than most existing image stitching software can. Eventually, Jump videos will be hosted in YouTube; think of it as the next logical step following YouTube's inclusion of 360-degree videos earlier this year. There are a few obvious reasons for running this as an early-release program. One is the price — only a certain type of person (or company) is going to want or be able to fork over $15,000 for something like this. And, as GoPro and Google wade into the world of 3D, 360-degree virtual reality, both companies want make sure the experience looks great. Controlling who makes the first videos for Jump makes it easier for the companies to ensure no one ever sees bad (or just boring) content.

The watches will work with any Android device — but they won't work with iPhones. It might not seem like it, but it's actually surprising to see this platform get released in the country. Unlike Android on phones and tablets, Android watches have relied heavily on Google's services — services that are not available in China. And so, Google has decoupled Android Wear from its normal dependence on Google Now and Google Play. In their stead, Lenovo and Motorola have turned to a Chinese company, Mobvoi, to provide search and voice recognition. While that means that Chinese users won't get Google Now cards, they will be able to search, perform voice actions like calling a taxi, and even dictate messages. So while the experience won't be identical to what's available elsewhere in the world, it won't be radically limited. Mobvoi and Sogui will provide services In fact, Google needed to do ""quite a lot of work"" to decouple Android Wear from Google's services, according to David Singleton, engineering director for Android. One small example, instead of saying ""Ok Google"" to your watch, you'd say ""Ni hao Android"" before speaking to it. In addition to MobVoi for voice features, Sogou will provide the mapping functionality for Android Wear. Google also says that Chinese app developers will be able to install apps onto Wear devices — though of course those apps will be installed via local app stores, not the Google Play app store. Recently, The Information and The Wall Street Journal have both reported that Google is interested in bringing its services back to China — starting with the Google Play app store for Android. Google, of course, is not commenting — but sources tell those sites that the company would be willing to censor the apps in the Chinese version of its store. It would be an important move for Google as it continues to try to keep its Android platform from fragmenting too much. The tension between putting more of Android under Google's control and leaving as much as possible in the open-source builds has been getting stronger lately. Google has been pushing more and more features through its suite of Google Play services. The most notable might be the technology behind the browser software on Android handsets, which for many users now gets updated automatically thanks to Google's services. None of those updates get to China in anything like a timely fashion (if they come at all). That's presumably one of the reasons Google might be interested in coming back to China, albeit in a compromised way. Just as importantly, it ensures that there is consistency across devices and that most of them are on a relatively recent version of the OS. Android is getting more and more Google-ified over time And that tension between Google control and openness is actually even stronger with Android Wear. Until this new version of the Moto 360, Wear has been more locked down than the rest of Android. Though Google is quick to point out that manufacturers are free to load up their own apps on these watches, they are not free to create customized versions that are radically different from the core of the platform. That may be one reason that both Samsung and LG have taken the time to create competing smartwatch platforms — they want them to have a differentiated experience and support things like cellular radios right away. ""There's a real need to be able to iterate quickly."" Singleton says that Google is comfortable with this more locked-down strategy for Android Wear. ""For Android Wear and wearables in general, we still feel the market is really early,"" Singleton says. ""There's a real need to be able to iterate quickly... so that there's a good, consistent experience for users and developers."" Singleton's not wrong; keeping the platform more locked down ensures stability and consistency across devices that often look quite different from one another. But it also means we're not likely to see a bunch of  manufacturers create Android Wear watches in the same way we've seen them create Android phones. What does it mean, then, that the Moto 360 with Android Wear is getting released in China? Well, it means that the Moto 360 is getting released in China and actually not much more. Google isn't bringing search and the Play store to the mainland (yet). Android Wear still requires manufacturers to partner up with Google to release a watch (for now). Those two stories are the same today as they were yesterday. But will they be the same tomorrow? We'll leave the final answer to newly minted Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Back in May, I asked him, ""Is your philosophy still 'we hope to get there but we're going to wait and see,' or are there going to be any changes there in the near future?"" Here's his reply: It's a good question. We are going to continue providing Android to the fullest extent possible in China, so we are incredibly excited. [...] We deeply care about investing there. We would love to serve Chinese users with Google services as well, obviously. I think it will be a privilege to do that, but we need to be thoughtful in how we do it. We are open to newer approaches.

In the past few years, action cameras have developed from niche curiosities into really popular devices that can capture amazing footage. But every year it's still the same story: market-leader GoPro releases a new camera, and other companies desperately try to catch up. Some companies have come close to making one as good as its best, but as soon as they do, GoPro releases a new one.  This time around, however, GoPro’s releases were aimed at the low end. That means all of its competitors had a year to catch up to the company’s two standard bearers: the Hero 4 Black and the Hero 4 Silver.  The most important thing an action camera should do is shoot beautiful, high-quality footage, with different options for resolutions and framerates. It should also have a great system of accessories and mounts so you can put the camera anywhere and use it to record anything you're doing, which means it also has to be small and light enough that it’s not a burden to wear. Action cameras should also be easy to use, with good on-camera controls and a great companion app for your smartphone. The race to make the best action camera is tighter than ever before, but only one of them does all of these things better than the others — and it shouldn’t come as a surprise. Shot on location at Pocono Whitewater Rafting Center. Also available on YouTube.   The best action camera you can buy is the GoPro Hero 4 Black. It shoots excellent footage in sunlight, cloudy weather, indoors, and even at night. It may be pricey, but it still gives you the best image quality you can get from any action camera, hands down. The Hero 4 Black has a super wide field of view, shoots 4K footage, and offers a few different super slow motion modes as well. But the footage also looks great even if you’re shooting at 1080p, which is really the right resolution for most people. And while you probably wouldn’t want to use it as your only still camera, it takes gorgeous 12-megapixel photos. It’s also tiny. Even with a waterproof housing on it, the Hero 4 Black is hard to notice, whether you have it strapped to your arm or stuck to your helmet. It’s solidly built and can take a few dings and drops if you don’t have a case on it. The battery is easy to swap, which is good, because short battery life is still one of the biggest problems you’ll face when using a GoPro. GoPro menus used to be a chore to navigate, but the company has really streamlined them with the Hero 4 lineup. Each menu is easy to read on the tiny, front-facing LCD screen, and they’re much easier to understand. If you don’t want to use the on-camera buttons, or if you have to set your camera up at a distance, you can always use GoPro’s great mobile app. It offers a live view with very little lag so it’s easy to frame up your shot, you can start and stop recording from it and change settings on the fly, and it gives you the ability to trim, save, and share clips. And if you’re new to video editing, the GoPro desktop app has really come a long way as well. Proprietary desktop software is usually pretty awful, but GoPro has finally made something worth installing if you want to edit video without learning advanced editing software like Final Cut Pro. But one of the best things about GoPro is the assortment of mounts and accessories that are available for it. The company makes one for just about any application you can imagine. They sell roll bar mounts, helmet mounts, chest straps, selfie sticks, dog mounts, underwater housings, and so much more. Even better, GoPro has been the industry standard for so long that third-party companies also make dozens of mounts for these cameras, as well as some really crazy accessories. The Hero 4 Black is still the best you can get, but if you have a smaller budget or really specific needs, this is the best time ever to really weigh your options. Right behind the Hero 4 Black is the Hero 4 Silver. The Hero 4 Silver is nearly the same camera as its more expensive counterpart, and it’s just as great. You still get really awesome image quality in almost any setting, even though you lose the ability to shoot 4K video and super slow motion. What you gain is a built-in LCD touchscreen, which makes it extremely easy to line up your shot or review your footage (at the expense of battery life, of course). The Silver is typically about $100 cheaper than the Hero 4 Black, too, but it works with all the same mounts and accessories, so you’re not really worse off for buying it. It may not be quite as capable as the Hero 4 Black, but if you’re new to action cameras, this is probably your best bet.   The ION Air Pro 3 is a tough, cylindrical camera that produces rich images which need less tuning in an editing software, but its price is a bit steep for what little you get in return. ION makes a decent amount of accessories, and it does have a good phone app — which is a good thing because there's little you can do to change them on the camera itself.   If you're an adventurer looking to quantify every activity you record, Garmin’s Virb Elite holds its own. It comes with great battery life and offers the ability to overlay on your video your GPS, altimeter and other data from companion Garmin devices like a heart rate monitor. Compared to others, the Virb’s video quality isn’t a standout, and often captures colors that just look wrong. It's a niche device in a market for the masses.  JVC’s Adixxion is a little older but does a decent job with its image quality, and it doesn’t even need a case thanks to its rugged build.

Earlier this summer, Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri said that the Finnish company will indeed look to make a return, by designing and licensing handsets, to the mobile market once its agreement with Microsoft to not use the Nokia name on smartphones had expired. Having been barred from branding any smartphones as Nokias until the end of 2015, the company is now working on its plans for 2016 and beyond, which it has said will not conflict with Microsoft's mobile efforts: ""Microsoft makes mobile phones. We would simply design them and then make the brand name available to license."" The concept Nokia C1 would run run on Android Marshmallow, powered by an Intel Atom processor inside. Its proposed 5-inch size and 1080p resolution are both rather conventional, and the suggestion is that Nokia should aim for a budget-friendly device. The Nokia N1 tablet, introduced earlier this year, sets the likely blueprint for what we can expect from its next mobile device. The N1 was manufactured and distributed by Foxconn, which licensed Nokia's design and brand. There's no guarantee that Foxconn will again be the partner for any new smartphone projects, though given the two companies' established collaboration, it would seem to be a probable candidate. If Nokia does decide to develop an Android smartphone, it wouldn't be its first one ever — that was the Nokia X — though it would be the first without Microsoft's influence and control.   Update September 8th 8:33AM ET: It appears that these pictures are the product of a Nokia fan's imagination rather than prototypes from the Finnish company. They were originally posted by Kim Wayne, who also presented an earlier set of renders of the purported C1.

That new laptop was a revelation: extremely thin and light, like the original Air, yet also powerful enough for most tasks and equipped with a long-lasting battery. For years, the MacBook Air has been a standard-bearer, the role model for every Windows ultrabook, but 2015 has not been so kind to its leadership position. Apple introduced the new 12-inch MacBook and updated the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro, both directly competing with the Air, and for those not umbilically attached to OS X, Dell’s XPS 13 offered a compelling Windows alternative. And this week there’s the looming threat of the iPad Pro on the horizon. Has Apple forsaken what was once its best PC? Until this year, I wondered why anyone would buy the MacBook Pro, a laptop I considered to be a fatter, slightly more powerful version of the Air. Its battery didn’t last as long, it was thicker and heavier, and it was more expensive. After reviewing the 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina display, however, I’m asking myself why I am still stuck with the Air. The difference between the two machines is as simple as it is compelling: the display. Apple’s Pro laptop just embarrasses its Air sibling when the two are set side by side. The Pro has more than three times the resolution, much wider viewing angles, and better contrast and color reproduction. The new MacBook also has an IPS display with Retina-class resolution and it also looks light years better than the Air. The Air has fallen behind and Apple isn't helping it up Apple is not a company that can be accused of doing things thoughtlessly, and the decision to leave the Air’s display at the lower quality and resolution must be taken as a deliberate one. In other words, Apple is comfortable with keeping the Air as a technological straggler in its lineup. That leaves us with a choice of two most likely scenarios: either the Air is destined for a future overhaul and its first redesign in five years or it has no future at all. There’s not enough room in Apple’s lineup for a MacBook, a MacBook Air, and a MacBook Pro — the MacBook is Apple’s ultraportable machine of the future and the MacBook Pro is the do-it-all laptop of today. The MacBook Air’s position seems tenuous already, and if the alleged iPad Pro does indeed materialize, then we may as well bid adieu to the Air entirely. The iPad Pro is expected to be a 12.9-inch device with optional keyboard and stylus accessories and the ability to run two full apps side by side. Sure, it will be based on iOS instead of OS X, but there are plenty of good iPad apps to replace the basic productivity tools of Apple’s desktop software. My usual MacBook Air workload involves writing, photo editing, communicating with colleagues, and keeping track of happenings on Twitter and YouTube. The presumed iPad Pro would handle the vast majority of these tasks with aplomb, and it would do it with a better-looking touchscreen display and potentially even thinner profile. The heir to the Air is a trifecta of more purposeful devices Looking at Apple’s lineup with the iPad Pro included is like gazing out on a siege surrounding the MacBook Air. If a super-thin laptop is your top priority, get the new MacBook. If power and versatility are more important, get the MacBook Pro, which is only marginally heavier than the MacBook Air while giving you so much more. And if you want to have a touchscreen on your mobile PC, try out the iPad Pro. There’s just no clear-cut case for why the MacBook Air should exist, at least in its present state, in among all this internal competition from Apple itself. The Air rose to prominence by offering the perfect balance between a bunch of competing priorities, but now its multipurpose nature is acting against it, as it feels compromised from whatever perspective a potential buyer might approach it. The Intel-fueled ultrabook movement came in the immediate wake of the 2010 MacBook Air, and for years it was simply a case of Windows PC makers trying to catch up with Apple’s paragon of laptop versatility. Uncompetitive battery life and unreliable touchpads were the bane of Windows laptops for a long time, however this year’s Dell XPS 13 is the harbinger of a much-improved class of competition. It has the build and display quality of a truly modern machine, and it’s not hampered by the old issues that held Windows back. With the new Skylake processors from Intel, many others should be joining Dell in providing highly attractive alternatives to Apple’s old reliable MacBook Air. If Apple wanted to ward off the threat of Windows laptops, it would have meaningfully upgraded the MacBook Air by now. If it had wanted to keep its current product lineup, it would have given the Air a reason to exist alongside its other MacBooks. But what Apple wants is signaled most lucidly by the imminent arrival of the iPad Pro. There will be MacBooks and a MacBook Pro, there will be a set of mainstream iPads and an iPad Pro. It’s a clean, simple lineup with clear delineation between every product. As revolutionary as it once was, the MacBook Air just doesn't fit in Apple's future.",0.5017198587348567,0.4982801412651433,0.17071260029366583,918,4.761437908496732,452,6.1526548672566372,0,0,"Apple, Tech, Essay"

Francis warned that the world faces ""the unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequence for all of us,"" and reiterated the scientific community's view that climate change is a man-made phenomenon that needs to be addressed without delay. ""one of the principal challenges facing humanity."" ""Climate change is a global problem with grave implications,"" writes Francis. ""It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day. Its worst impact will probably be felt by developing countries in coming decades."" The Pope stressed that richer, developed countries were mostly responsible for the crisis, and that they have a duty to help poorer nations. He also blamed ""the myopia of power politics"" and our reliance on technology, which ""sometimes solves one problem only to create others."" The Pope's words have already proved controversial in the US, after a draft of the essay was leaked earlier this week. Presidential candidate and converted Catholic Jeb Bush was one of many Republican politicians to refute Francis's remarks. ""I hope I’m not going to get castigated for saying this by my priest back home, but I don’t get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinal or my pope,"" said Bush in a campaign speech in New Hampshire. ""I think religion ought to be about making us better as people and less about things that end up getting in the political realm."" The Pope, however, disagrees. Although the essay does mention and critique specific policies (carbon credits, for example, are dismissed as a ""ploy"" to maintain ""excessive consumption""), it also makes an argument that is rooted in Christian beliefs. The title of the essay comes from a 13th century prayer by St. Francis of Assisi known as The Canticle of the Creatures that refers to ""our Sister, Mother Earth, who sustains and governs us."" Francis stresses this idea of humanity's stewardship of the Earth and rejects interpretations of the Bible (specifically of the book of Genesis) that grant mankind ""dominion"" over the Earth. ""THE BIBLICAL TEXTS [IMPLY] A RELATIONSHIP OF MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY."" ""We must forcefully reject the notion that our being created in God’s image and given dominion over the earth justifies absolute domination over other creatures,"" writes Francis. ""The biblical texts are to be read in their context ... recognizing that they tell us to 'till and keep' the garden of the world (cf. Gen 2:15). 'Tilling' refers to cultivating, ploughing or working, while 'keeping' means caring, protecting, overseeing and preserving. This implies a relationship of mutual responsibility."" It will be difficult for Catholics — politicians, perhaps, withstanding — to ignore the Pope's words. The essay took the form of an encyclical, the second most authoritative form of papal address. Past encyclicals have been used to outline the Church's stance on important issues, such as denouncing the policies of the Third Reich and reaffirming its rejection of birth control. And while encyclicals are not necessarily infallible (statements made under the aegis of papal infallibility are incredibly rare and pertain only to matters of faith), they should, at least, give faithful Catholics pause for thought. THE POPE'S INTENDED AUDIENCE IS ALL OF HUMANITY However, it's clear that the Pope's intended audience is all of humanity — the secular and the religious, whatever denomination. As well as climate change, Laudato Si' addresses global issues such as ""the culture of consumerism, which prioritizes short-term gain and private interest,"" and the continuing need to ""eliminate extreme poverty."" However, the Pope concludes that ""all is not lost."" ""Human beings, while capable of the worst,"" he writes, ""are also capable of rising above themselves, choosing again what is good, and making a new start, despite their mental and social conditioning. We are able to take an honest look at ourselves, to acknowledge our deep dissatisfaction, and to embark on new paths to authentic freedom.""",0.7317876664484237,0.26821233355157625,0.7085525236208027,669,5.3497757847533629,423,6.5460992907801421,0,0,"Science, US & World"

In short, this space agency is ready to turn the idea into reality. For many in the scientific community, Europa has tummies all aflutter. With its icy crust and a theorized subsurface ocean, Jupiter’s fourth largest moon is perhaps the best candidate in our galactic neighborhood for finding traces of life outside of our planet. And although scientists don’t expect to find complex life forms swimming in this salty sea, many believe that conditions could be just right for some tiny organisms to survive. Europa has tummies all aflutter It may take some time before we can confirm whether or not these alien beings do exist, however. NASA’s current plan is not to test for life directly, but instead test for Europa’s habitability. The mission now in development is dubbed the ""Europa Clipper"" mission, and it calls for a space probe to ""clip"" Europa’s atmosphere rather than land on its surface. Once the spacecraft makes it to the moon, it will perform 45 flybys — dipping in close to Europa to gather as much data as possible before dipping back out again. In May, NASA announced the nine instruments it had selected to test Europa’s habitability, some of which were graced with colorful acronyms. These included REASON, a radar system for looking at structures underneath the ice crust, and ICEMAG, an instrument that will map Europa’s magnetic field. Spectrometers and dust analyzers will also be used to figure out what’s floating around the moon, as well as what makes up those weird, squiggly, orange lines on its surface. The Europa Clipper concept has successfully passed its first major review, meaning NASA considers it to be feasible. So far, the mission is on track for a launch in the mid-2020s. That may be a while from now, but the good news is you can learn more about the mission with this NASA-made video called Alien Ocean, complete with flashy transitions and a passionate soundtrack.

This might seem like really weird news, but the study that backs this up may help scientists get a better handle on the evolution of mammals — in addition to dispelling the notion that true ""handedness,"" the tendency to favor one limb over another, is uniquely human trait. True handedness isn't a uniquely human trait ""We found a pronounced degree of handedness in an animal group only distantly related to humans,"" says Yegor Malashichev, a zoologist at Saint Petersburg State University and a co-author of the study published in Current Biology today. And the degree of handedness was ""comparable to that in our species."" No too long ago, researchers thought of handedness as a trait only humans possessed. That notion has changed somewhat over the last few decades, as scientists demonstrated that hand preferences and other behavioral lateralization relating to brain asymmetry are ""much more widespread spread in the animal kingdom than previously thought,"" Malashichev says. These preferences have even been found in bees, worms, and frogs that walk instead of jump. But, for the most part, the degree of handedness that we've seen in non-primates hasn't been as strong as what we see in humans, and it tends to be related to specific behaviors and tasks, instead of a general way of approaching the world, as is the case with humans. ""More lateralized, or handed, than many of primates and even Great Apes."" Now, ""this last bastion has fallen,"" Malashichev says. Researchers have found a group with the same pattern of handedness as the one seen in humans. ""So, we can say that kangaroos possess not just some population level preferences in certain actions, but possess real true handedness, like humans have,"" he says. ""In this respect, they appear to be more lateralized, or handed, than many of primates and even Great Apes."" As you might have guess, Malashichev and his colleagues spent a lot of time observing kangaroos before they reached this conclusion. They observed seven species of marsupials living in the wild. Those species included red-necked wallabies, Goodfellow's tree kangaroo, the eastern grey kangaroo, and the red kangaroo. The scientists watched them as they groomed themselves, grabbed food with their paws, and leaned on their forearms while feeding on grass. And throughout this period, they collected data relating to hand preference for a set of tasks.   A red-necked wallaby, manipulating food with one forelimb. Credit: Andrey Giljov and the National Geographic Society Eventually, the scientists concluded that the majority of wild kangaroos are lefties. They like to use their left forelimbs for grooming their noses, picking leaves, and bending tree branches, for instance. This preference was most apparent in two species, the eastern grey kangaroo and the red kangaroo. Red-necked wallabies, however, prefer to use their left hand for tasks that require fine manipulations, and their right hand for task in which strength is key. Overall, the researchers found a lot less evidence for handedness in species that spend a lot of time in trees.   Credit: Giljov, et al (2015) Humans and kangaroos aren't all that similar, but when you think about it, they do have one very important thing in common: both species spend a lot of time walking around on two legs. As a result, Malashichev and his colleagues suggest that moving on two legs is a triggering factor in the emergence of handedness. Animals that rely on four legs, in contrast, only show a ""subtle degree of handedness,"" Malashichev says. T. rex had really small hands, so it might not have shown a preference That said, walking on two legs probably isn't the only condition for developing ""true handedness."" Some dinosaurs, like our pal the T. rex, also walked around on two, gigantic and terrifying limbs. But its ""hands"" were very small, proportionally speaking, which means they might not have used them for fine manipulations or grooming, Malashichev says. (Remember, many dinosaurs had feathers, so some bipedal species may have groomed themselves.) True handedness really wasn't expected in kangaroos, largely because their brains are different from other mammals. They don't have the same neural circuits that bridge the right and left hemispheres of the brain. But this result muddles that idea a bit, and researchers may have to study the kangaroo brain further. The researchers who conducted this study now plan to look at other marsupials, such as koalas. They would also like to focus on other animals that occasionally get around on two legs, like meerkats. Marsupials hold a pretty weird place among mammals, so studying their brain function may yield some interesting information about our shared evolutionary history. But for now, this is yet another study that shows that humans might not deserve that pedestal we like to put ourselves on.

Now, researchers have found that the rate at which we dispose of this liquid may greatly impact the chance that one of these quakes will occur. The faster we inject this water into the ground, the higher likelihood of induced Earth rumblings.   For years, researchers have known that humans can at least partially cause seismic activity. Whenever fluid is added to or withdrawn from the ground, the state of stress on the crust changes. And if that fluid pressure changes inside a fault, friction can decrease, causing the two sides of the fault to push away from each other. Wastewater and fluid injection, dam and reservoir construction, mining, and hydraulic fracturing all contribute to these pressure changes. ""It’s really only a smaller subset of injection wells that are linked to earthquakes."" Fluid injection wells are important tools for the oil industry. They help dispose of saltwater byproducts from oil and gas activities, as well as pump fluids into existing oil reservoirs — increasing pressure and consequently boosting oil production. These wells are similar to fracking wells, which also inject fluids into the ground to fracture shale rocks and release natural gas. However, wells used for oil recovery inject fluids for years or decades at a time, while fracking wells only inject fluids for a few hours or days. Experts have known about wastewater injection wells’ ability to trigger quakes for some time, but they’ve been unsure about which wells are the most to blame. ""Many factors [of these wells] have been proposed that could contribute to earthquakes: the volume of water injected, the depth of injection, the closer you are to faults,"" says George Choy, a research geophysicist at the USGS, who was not involved in the study. ""If you can determine which ones are more important, you can prioritize controlling them."" Now, a new study published in Science has parsed these factors, finding that wells with the highest injection rates are twice as likely to be associated with earthquakes than lower-performing wells. ""The idea was to look at this on a broad scale,"" study author Matthew Weingarten, a doctoral student at University of Colorado-Boulder, tells The Verge. ""It’s really only a smaller subset of injection wells that are linked to earthquakes, so we wanted to try to figure out if there is some kind of well operation that increases the likelihood."" Weingarten and his research team catalogued the production rates of 180,000 injection wells located between Colorado and the East Coast. They found the wells that pumped more than 300,000 barrels of wastewater into the ground per month were statistically associated with earthquakes. Wells that pump that much wastewater are considered ""high rate""; about 18,000 wells — mostly in Oklahoma and Texas — were associated with the most seismic activity.  ""Since this is a process that appears to be controllable, you could mitigate the effects."" ""We understand the physics of induced seismicity pretty well,"" says Weingarten. ""If you increase absolute pressure, you’re going to have an induced earthquake; the physics show these high-rate injection wells preserve the ambient fluid pressure over a larger magnitude than lower-rate wells."" Weingarten notes that numerous factors were considered, including the wells’ total volume production and proximity to fault lines, but injection rates stood out. He suggests policy makers and regulators could maybe manipulate these rates to lessen induced earthquakes, though he isn’t making any formal recommendations. Financial incentives may hinder attempts to limit the rate of wastewater injection. Typically, only 30 percent of oil can be extracted from a mature reservoir, but fluid injections increase oil recovery to between 50 and 70 percent.

The drug also worked to block infection in healthy mice and to stop transmission, according to a study published in Nature today. The fact that the drug can act against so many stages of malaria is pretty new, but what's even more exciting is the compound's mode of action: it kills malaria in a completely new way, researchers say. The feature would make it a welcome addition to our roster of antimalarials — a roster that's threatened by drug resistance. Researchers sifted through a library of about 4,700 compounds to find this one Malaria is an infectious disease that's transmitted through mosquito bites; it's also a leading cause of death in a number of developing countries. Approximately 3.4 billion people live in areas where malaria poses a real threat. As a result, there were 207 million cases of malaria in 2012 — and 627,000 deaths. There are drugs that can be used to prevent malaria, and even treat it, but drug resistance is halting the use of certain treatments in some areas. Searching for a new drug is all about trial and error. To find this particular compound, researchers sifted through a library of about 4,700 compounds, testing them to see if they were capable of killing the malaria parasite in a lab setting. When they found something that worked, they tweaked the drug candidate to see if it could perform more effectively. ""We went through a lot of these cycles of testing and designing new compounds,"" says Ian Gilbert, a medicinal chemist at the University of Dundee in the UK, and a co-author of the study. ""Eventually we optimized to the compound which is the subject of the paper."" For now, that compound's unwieldy name is DDD107498. To make sure DDD107498 really had potential, the researchers tested it on mice that had already been infected with malaria. A single dose was enough to provoke a 90 percent reduction in the number of parasites in their blood. The scientists also gave the compound to healthy mice that were subsequently exposed to malaria. DDD107498 helped the mice evade infection with a single dose, but it's unclear how long that effect would last in humans. Finally, the researchers looked at whether the compound could prevent the transmission from an infected mouse to a mosquito. A day after receiving the treatment, mice were put in contact with mosquitoes. The scientists noted a 91 percent reduction in infected mosquitoes.  ""It has the ability to be a one-dose [drug], in combination with another molecule."" ""What's exciting about this molecule is obviously the fact that it has the ability to be a one-dose [drug], in combination with another molecule to cure blood stage malaria,"" says Kevin Read, a drug researcher also at the University of Dundee and a co-author of the study. The fact that the compound has the ability to block transmission and protect against infection is equally thrilling. But the way in which DDD107498 kills malaria might be its most interesting feature. It halts the production of proteins — which are necessary for the parasite's survival. No other malaria drug does that right now, Read says. ""So, in principle, there's no resistance out there already to this mechanism."" The drug hasn't been tested in humans yet, so it may not be nearly as good in the field. But Read says DDD107498 looks promising. ""From all the pre-clinical or non-clinical data we've generated, it is comparable or better than any of the current marketed anti-malarials in those studies."" And at $1 per treatment, the price of the drug should fall ""within the range of what's acceptable,"" he says. ""It looks like an excellent study, and the results look very important,"" says Philip Rosenthal, a malaria drug researcher at The University of California-San Francisco who didn't participate in the study. This is a big shift for Rosenthal's field. Five years ago, ""we had very little going on in anti-malarial drug discovery,"" he says. Now, there's quite a bit going on for malaria researchers, and a number of promising compounds are moving along. DDD107498 ""is another player, and it's got a number of positive features,"" he says. Other treatments have to be taken for a few days One of the features is the drug's potency. It's very active against cultured malaria parasites, Rosenthal says. But what's perhaps most intriguing about DDD107498 is that the drug works against the mechanism that enables protein synthesis the malaria parasite's cells. No other malaria drug does that right now, Read says. ""Considering challenges of treating malaria, which is often in rural areas and developing countries, a single dose would be a big plus,"" he says. ""In addition, because of it's long half life, it may also work to prevent malaria with once a week dosing, which is also a benefit."" Still, no drug is perfect. The data suggests that DDD107498 doesn't kill malaria as quickly as some other drugs, Rosenthal says. And when the researchers tested it to see how long it might take for resistance to develop, the results weren't as promising as he would like. The parasites figured out a way to become resistant to the compound ""relatively easily,"" he says.  That shouldn't be ""deal-killer,"" however. ""Its slow onset of action probably means it should be combined with a faster-acting drug,"" he says. But it's slow-acting The compound is going through safety testing now. If everything goes well, it should hit human trials within the next year, Read says. Chances are, it will have to be used in combination with other malaria drugs, Gilbert says. ""All anti-malarials are given in combination because it slows down resistance."" ""When you're treating infectious diseases, you know that drug resistance is always a potential problem, so having a number of choices to treat malaria is a good thing,"" Rosenthal says. In this case, the drug's new mode of action may hold lead to an entirely new weapon against malaria. ""Obviously it's got a long way to go,"" Read says. But the compound is ""very exciting,"" nonetheless.",0.5516397410601089,0.44836025893989107,0.2214507335527209,1028,4.9620622568093387,473,6.1501057082452428,0,0,"Science, Report"

But concerns remain about the impact of medical marijuana on teenagers. In a new study published today in The Lancet Psychiatry, researchers found that there was actually no increased use of the drug among youths in the states where laws have been passed for medical marijuana. Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the USMarijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the US, with widespread use among young people — so it’s surprising that the changes in laws didn’t seem to impact use. In the 21 states where medical marijuana is legal, there was a higher use of marijuana even before laws were passed compared with other states, said Deborah Hasin, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Medical Center, and lead author on the study. However, there was no increase in rates of adolescent marijuana use after a state legalized the drug for medical use, she explained. Hasin and her team assessed data from the Monitoring the Future study, which includes information from over 1 million students who were in the eighth, 10th and 12th grades (13–18 years) of 400 schools. Those surveys started in 1991, and the most recent was in 2014. During that time, 21 states passed laws for the use of marijuana for medical purposes; the first being California in 1996, and the 21st state was Maryland last year. (Since the most recent study, Minnesota and New York have also legalized medical marijuana.) Students completed a self-administered questionnaire about any marijuana use in the previous 30 days. The researchers adjusted the data to account for various factors, such as sex, age, race, education of parents, class size, and whether educated at an urban or rural school, public or private school. The study found that 16 percent of teenagers used marijuana in the states where medical marijuana was later legalized, compared with 13 percent of teenagers in the states where there are no such laws. But there was no statistical significant difference between teenage marijuana use before or after the laws were passed. There was no significant difference between teen marijuana use before and after medical marijuana laws were passedThis study gives the most definitive answer to date on the contentious question of whether medical marijuana laws increase cannabis use among teenagers, Kevin Hill from the Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse, Belmont, told The Verge. Early adolescent use of marijuana may have long-term harmful consequences such as altered brain development, cognitive damage, and psychiatric symptoms — and the study authors write that cannabis use in teenagers can impact employment prospects and can result in substance addiction. Policy makers and scientists seem to have widely varying opinions on what legalizing medical marijuana will do for teenagers. Richard Gil Kerlikowske, US Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection and Former Director of the Office of National Drug Control Police, thinks that legalizing medical marijuana will give teenagers the wrong idea: ""When I’ve done focus groups with high school students in states where medical marijuana is legal, they say, 'Well, if it’s called medicine, and it’s given to patients by caregivers, then that’s really the wrong message for us as high school students.'"" A 2014 Monitoring the Future study assessing teenage drug use in the US found fewer young people believe marijuana is risky. In this same study high school seniors (age 17 and 18 years) said they would try marijuana or use it more often if it were legalized for general use. And in another survey of teenagers, in states that had not legalized medical marijuana, 55 percent (out of 393 teenagers) thought that passing a law like this would ""make it easier for teens to start to smoke marijuana for fun."" A growing body of evidence shows medical marijuana doesn't impact teen drug useBut this new study can be added to a growing body of evidence that actually shows that legalizing medical marijuana does not impact teenage drug use. A recent 2014 study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health looked at data from over 11 million teenagers and found similar findings: there was no statistically significant differences in use of marijuana before or after policy changes were made, although the period looked at for this was shorter (20 years) than this new study. Medical marijuana research — despite being underfunded, and despite researchers’ difficulties in acquiring study drugs — has suggested benefits for several disorders. The jury is still out, since almost no large clinical trials have been conducted, but a few studies have shown positive effects in conditions including glaucoma and neuropathy. Though the FDA hasn’t approved pot as a safe and effective treatment for any diseases, the agency has indicated it supports further scientific research. ""An easy assumption to make would be that medical marijuana laws would increase access to marijuana, and therefore use among adolescents would increase,"" said Kevin Hill in an accompanying comment published in The Lancet Psychiatry.

The tech company is commercializing Harvard-pioneered technology known as Organs-on-Chips — a method of simulating organ systems on tiny microchips — and it now has used the technique to turn deadly blood clots into chip form, as well. Before a newly developed drug can be tested on people, researchers need to have a pretty good grasp of how the medication is going to affect the human body. That means the drug must go through numerous rounds of animal testing first — but a rodent or chimp’s response to a medication doesn’t always translate so smoothly in a person. To get a more accurate picture of how human organs will react to a drug (without using actual human organs), Organs-on-Chips gather together a collection of thousands of cells in a chip the size of a memory stick to mimic the biological processes of individual organs. The aim is to test novel drugs on these tiny organs first, so as to produce a more predictive biological response to a drug and perhaps lessen the need for animal testing. Getting a more accurate picture of how human organs will react to a drug The Organs-on-Chips technique was originally developed by researchers at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University, who reduced major organs like hearts and lungs to chip size. Emulate has now used this method to recreate thrombosis — commonly referred to as a blood clot. Appropriately dubbed Thrombosis-on-Chip, the platform models the various factors that lead to the formation of blood clots within the body. The chip also simulates the flow of blood and interaction of platelets, which help form clots. Clots stop a small wound from being life-threatening, but too much clotting can also block blood flow to organs like the brain, lungs and heart, with potentially-deadly consequences. Knowing how clots form will help drugmakers come up with better ways to treat conditions like deep vein thrombosis — which is part of what contributed to Serena Williams’ hospitalization in 2011, after a blood clot lodged in her lung.

The sight led them to suspect that a dust cloud might be percolating miles above them — but no further evidence has been found to validate this idea. The explanation for it remained a mystery.  Now, writing in Nature, researchers from the University of Colorado have confirmed that a big, lopsided dust cloud does indeed exist on the surface of the Moon. Yay, mystery solved, right? Well, not quite. The position and composition of this newly revealed dust cloud doesn’t quite explain the weird glow seen by NASA astronauts over 40 years ago. But the discovery does indicate that maybe other airless planetary objects have dust clouds surrounding them as well. That means rocky planets without dense atmospheres could have some interesting materials floating around them in nearby space — an important thing to consider if we ever want to visit Mars, which has an atmospheric pressure just one-hundredth of Earth’s. Dust clouds are important things to consider if we ever want to visit Mars When they first saw this unexplained ethereal glow, the Apollo astronauts suspected that a phenomenon called light scattering was behind it. Light scattering works like this: when sunlight hits many tiny dust particles, it scatters in various directions, giving off what looks like extra brightness. But to explain the Apollo glow, a dust cloud would have needed to have some very particular properties: It would need to be a high-density cloud, filled with particles just one-tenth of a micron in radius. And the cloud would need to be situated 10 to 60 miles above the Moon’s surface.   (NASA) Using data collected from NASA’s Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), the uncrewed lunar probe that orbited the Moon from 2013 to 2014, study author Mihaly Horányi and his team went looking for this mysterious Apollo cloud — only to find another dust cloud altogether. The one they discovered is less than a mile up and comprised of particles about half a micron thick, indicating that this is not the cloud that issued the weird Apollo light. There hasn’t been any evidence of the Apollo cloud in the last six months of LADEE, Horányi says. ""The cloud that would have explained the Apollo observations is certainly not there all the time,"" Horányi, a professor of physics at University of Colorado-Boulder, told The Verge. This dust cloud, however, is likely the result of high-speed interplanetary particles colliding with the lunar surface and then kicking up materials, according to Horányi. The researchers found that the density of the cloud even grows when meteors pass by, such as the Geminid meteor shower; particles in the meteors’ tails bombard the Moon’s surface, amplifying the size of the cloud. High-speed interplanetary particles collide with the lunar surface and kick up materials Similar dust ejection effects have been seen previously on icy moons in our solar system, such as those surrounding Jupiter. Until now, researchers were unsure if these clouds could form over objects covered in the rocky soil found on the Moon and Mars, known as regolith. ""It could be that even though the Moon is bombarded at all times just like the icy moons of Jupiter, every single particle would bury itself deep into the surface and would not generate an outgoing population of particles,"" said Horányi. ""But that’s not the case. Even at the Moon, this process is at work."" That means it’s possible for clouds like these to be circulating above other rocky, airless planets, too. That’s important if we ever want to land humans on Mars, because we’ll have to consider everything that might stand in our way. Dust clouds surrounding planets can harm spacecraft and astronauts if they’re dense enough. As for what caused that glow back in the 1970s? The mystery remains. It’s possible that some electrostatic forces may have kicked up the dust during those two missions. Regardless, it’s definitely not what you’re thinking.

Twitter’s commitment to transparency appears to end when it makes the powerful uncomfortable. Back in 2012, Twitter decided to allow the Sunlight Foundation to collect and curate deleted tweets from lawmakers and people seeking public office in order to hold them accountable by preserving their public statements on the record. That behavior was in-line with a company whose founders constantly sold it as the nexus of free speech. ""We are the free speech wing of the free speech party,"" Twitter's former CEO Dick Costolo famously said that same year. But in June of this year, Twitter shut down the deleted tweet project in the US under the guise of ""honoring the expectation of user privacy."" Then, this Sunday, Twitter dealt the final blow, killing the Open State Foundation’s effort to archive deleted tweets from public officials in 30 other countries.  This is a terrible precedent, even if it’s not surprising. Twitter, like all profit-driven social platforms, has to make money — which means at some point it starts serving certain audiences (like celebrities and politicians) more than its ideals of free expression and transparency. The company sells itself as a democratizing tool the world over, but its actual commitment is more complicated. Twitter does care about preserving tweets — for brands. Twitter's decision is immensely hypocritical To put a fine point on Twitter’s hypocrisy, the company announced earlier this month that it would be giving some clients ""instant and complete access to every historical public Tweet,"" for the purposes of marketing. ""Dr. Carl Sagan once famously said, ‘you have to know the past to understand the present,’"" Twitter wrote in introducing the new feature. ""For brands to most effectively analyze Twitter data in the present, they also need to know what’s happened in the past."" Funny, since you could say citizens and voters — Twitter’s user base — have the same need. It’s easy to indict the effects of capitalism on public welfare, but Silicon Valley’s inexorable need to monetize everything might not be the real issue here. There seems to be a deeper, systemic problem at Twitter and elsewhere: treating everyone as equal when real people have different needs. Facebook, for instance, implemented a real-name requirement as a panacea for inauthenticity, but didn’t realize that type of automated policy is immensely harmful to marginalized groups of people who have good reasons for using pseudonyms. The move to ban Politwoops is based on false-equivalency Twitter’s decision to shut down the Open State Foundation and Sunlight Foundation’s deleted tweet programs is symptomatic of the kind of false-equivalency that runs rampant in tech companies. OSF says that Twitter banned its tool after ""thoughtful internal deliberation and close consideration of a number of factors"" that concluded with the idea that Twitter doesn’t distinguish between users. ""Imagine how nerve-racking — terrifying, even — tweeting would be if it was immutable and irrevocable?"", Twitter told OSF. ""No one user is more deserving of that ability than another. Indeed, deleting a tweet is an expression of the user’s voice."" But Twitter doesn’t actually believe its own statement, because the company doesn’t actually treat all users equally. It actively ""verifies"" people of public importance, like journalists and politicians, to help authenticate their statements for broad dissemination. Why would Twitter need to verify the identity of only some individuals if their words were not more important than others by some measure? Even one of Twitter’s core algorithms is biased; in 2011, the company modified its search engine to organize tweets based on the ""influence"" of users, meaning it privileges the thoughts of celebrities and powerful people over others. Twitter is fundamentally designed around the idea that people are not equal. Twitter has damaged its public trust Twitter is either incapable of making essential distinctions, or becoming submissive to powerful users — and either scenario should damage everyone’s trust in the platform. The question of who is a public figure is murky, but the idea that politicians and people in positions of state power are public figures is uncontroversial. That they should be held accountable by having their publicly-stated words stored as a matter of record is well-established and fundamental to concepts of democracy: elected officials form a bright line, not a slippery slope. Twitter's decision is especially flabbergasting when you consider that the company originally blessed the idea of preserving the deleted tweets of politicians, only to suddenly have a change of heart three years later. Twitter should reverse this harmful decision. The change in policy directly contradicts the company's mission statement, which is ""to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers.""

""Today I can confirm that Avid Life Media is offering a $500,000 reward to anyone providing information that leads to the identification, arrest, and prosecution of the person or persons responsible for the leak of the Ashley Madison database,"" said Evans, according to the BBC. He called the hack ""one of the largest data breaches in the world"" and ""very unique on its own,"" due to its scope and the personal nature of the data. Avid Life Media later confirmed the news in a statement. ""As [Toronto Police Services] indicated at today’s press event, the investigation is progressing in a 'positive direction,' but more help is needed from the outside,"" wrote a spokesperson. ""In the very best interest of our customers, who have been affected by this malicious act, we are firmly committed to fully assisting these law enforcement and investigative authorities, without reserve."" Police say they have unconfirmed reports of two suicides after user data leaked Evans didn't elaborate on the reports of suicide. One potentially Ashley Madison-related death was reported late last week in San Antonio, Texas, where three city employees' email addresses were found in the list of accounts. It's unclear, however, whether the employee's death was connected to the leaked information. Since many of Ashley Madison's email addresses weren't validated, it's also not clear whether the accounts actually belonged to the employees in question. Canada-based Avid Life Media has already asked potential informants to come forward, albeit without mention of a reward. ""While we are confident that the authorities will identify and prosecute each of [the hackers] to the fullest extent of the law, we also know there are individuals out there who can help to make this happen faster,"" wrote social media director Anthony Macri on August 18th, asking ""anyone with information that can lead to the identification, arrest and conviction of these criminals"" to email the company.

Triple-digit speeds were reported nearing a curve with a speed limit of just 50, which seems likely to have contributed to the accident — but some sort of object had apparently hit another train along the route, and the NTSB has ""not ruled out"" the possibility of objects hitting 188 as well. Still, speed has remained a central focus of the investigation, which has turned the focus to PTC — Positive Train Control, an established technology in the rail industry that uses a system of signals, computers, and GPS to prevent trains from going too fast and colliding with other trains in the event an engineer is incapacitated or makes a mistake. PTC is so promising as a tool for improving rail safety that the federal government has ordered its deployment across broad swaths of the US rail network by the end of 2015. And furthermore, the accident has led the Federal Railroad Administration to demand that Amtrak ""immediately"" enable automated controls on the segment of track where the disaster occurred.  But David Hughes, a former CEO of Amtrak, argues that the operator hasn't dragged its feet on deploying PTC — in fact, it was ""moving as fast as it could,"" he says in an email to The Verge: In fact, both Amtrak and the freight railroads have been going full speed in implementing PTC, but there are some formidable challenges.  For the freight railroads, when PTC technology was mandated by Congress, the technology to implement it did not exist.  So, railroads and the supply industry had to effectively invent it.  Everyone agreed that it could be invented, but that takes time and lots of integrity and safety testing.  In addition, the system required radio spectrum that wasn't available.  So the railroads had to go out and buy up in bits and pieces the radio spectrum to implement PTC.  Moreover, even with spectrum, sites for new radio towers were required which had long permitting process.  Every tower had to be approved by the local Indian tribe to ensure it wasn't near some sacred site.  Permitting was a real mess. No doubt the railroads felt that PTC did not have enough benefits to justify the $10 [billion] or so in costs, but I believe, as an insider in the railroad industry, that they have moved with all due haste in implementing PTC. As for Amtrak, the equipment for PTC was already installed in the track at the time of the accident.  It had not been made operational because Amtrak had only recently received FCC approval for their use of the spectrum they purchased.  So, the timing was really unfortunate, but Amtrak was moving as fast as it could to implement PTC on that curve. Hughes is correct in saying that the FCC just recently signed off on Amtrak's PTC spectrum in the area: a blog post by the FCC's Roger Sherman confirms that approval came in March of this year, while also noting that railroads must acquire spectrum at auction or from existing license holders ""by law"" — basically, the FCC can't pull new spectrum to meet the PTC mandate out of thin air. None of that is to say that an earlier request for approval from Amtrak couldn't have necessarily gotten PTC deployed to that curve more quickly, however; Sherman says that the FCC signed off on Amtrak's request ""just two days after Amtrak submitted a final amendment"" in March. It could still be ""up to 12 months"" before the NTSB issues its final report on the root cause of the crash, the agency reports. Its next update on the investigation is expected later this week.",0.23123920991302827,0.7687607900869717,0.8368809710190748,649,4.704160246533128,350,5.8542857142857141,0,0,"Transportation, Exclusive, Report"

That’s partly because it’s one of the few titles in recent memory to offer a serious challenge to heavyweights Gran Turismo and Forza — those simply don’t come around very often — but it’s also because of its unusual development structure. CARS was partially crowdfunded as the inaugural release from World of Mass Development, a project of Slightly Mad Studios intended to bring AAA games to market with more direct input from fans and less from major publishers, the goliaths of the gaming industry beholden to business interests and cold, hard deadlines. Now, it’s finally here as a true cross-platform release, coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Steam. (Support for PS3 and Xbox 360 was dropped during the development process, but a Wii U version is allegedly still in the works.) It’s been a bumpy road, though, as the development cycles of virtually all major titles tend to be. Specifically, I started to worry about Project CARS somewhere around the announcement of the third delay of its release earlier this year. I’m sorry to say that my concern wasn’t entirely without merit: it’s buggy, and unless you like extremely frustrating controls, this one may not be for you.     I tested the Xbox One version of Project CARS, which feels like a port from the moment it’s powered on. The on-screen text is uniformly microscopic, as if it’s designed to be viewed on a PC monitor that’s a few inches from your face. That doesn’t work particularly well on a sub-40-inch television that’s across the room. It’s not a huge deal — much of the text is automatically narrated as you work your way through the game’s deep, broad user interface as a sort of tutorial as you go — but it’s an early warning sign that CARS lacks the polish of a Forza. UI misgivings aside, CARS generally looks wonderful, both inside the cockpit and out. I was particularly impressed when I dialed up a track’s weather to ""thunderstorm,"" with realistic pools of reflective water accumulating on the asphalt and just enough splattered rain on my windows to make visibility a genuine challenge. I can’t honestly say it looks any better than Forza 5, though — and there are a few places where I felt the cars looked more ""plasticky"" than in other current-gen sims — but it’s still a joy to take in the visuals. Before you get to those visuals, though, you’ll want to wander through the unbelievably complete menus of settings and modes. In fact, Project CARS is a master class in immersive, comprehensive racing simulator design: one-off races are available, of course, but the career mode lets you work your way up from karts into a variety of different circuits — F1, LMP, stock car, so on. Races take place on actual calendar days, each with their own weather conditions, and involve practice, qualifiers, and actual races alike. As you progress, different teams will make you offers to participate in different classes of racing, while a fake social media stream will even have your ""fans"" respond in real time to your good and bad performances on the track. (Just like the real Twitter, the game’s fake hate-tweets can get a little depressing.)     The overwhelming configurability of the game left me a little intimidated at times: a glance at the settings screen, for instance, reveals dozens of fine-tuning adjustments for car control, well beyond anything I’ve seen on a console before. On the track, you can micro-manage your car’s setup (just as you can in titles like Forza and GT), but you can also configure your pit strategy. And the pits go well beyond refueling and tire changes: the game lets you choose from two different levels of performance-impacting damage, simulated mechanical failures, and even hyper-realistic race starts where jumping off the line can incur a pitting penalty. It really is the ""anti-Mario Kart"" — it entirely trades pick-up-and-play ease of use for endless customization. Granted, you don’t have to touch any of these settings if you don’t want to, but I found that I was continually futzing with tuning and realism settings because — to be very blunt — CARS doesn’t drive very well. Or, rather, it doesn’t drive very accessibly. It’s entirely possible that the title hewed so closely to realistic racing physics (as it set out to do) that it’s just very difficult to control with a standard console controller, but either way, it’s such a slog that the simple joy of playing a video game was sapped right out of it. In the end, I was spending more time adjusting my car than I was actually driving. But even if the finicky driving characteristics are truly by design, CARS has bugs. I wouldn’t be surprised if the game’s delays were related to last-minute bug stomping, but the studio didn’t manage to get them all: I observed almost constant screen tearing in some races, moderate slowdowns in congested turns that broke my concentration, and strange steering behavior that would occasionally cause me to go left when I wanted to go right, and vice versa. There are also little annoyances, like a menu system with a selector that jumps around randomly as you try to navigate through it. In aggregate, the bugginess was severe enough to make the game very, very hard, even with all of the driver assists turned on. If you feel at home on the tracks of Forza and GT, this game will give you a very serious — and often irritating — run for your money.     As complete as CARS is as a simulator, its catalog of cars is shockingly thin, and many major manufacturers are just missing altogether. It could be that the developers simply ran out of time to model any more vehicles, but I think the more likely explanation is a tricky and laborious licensing process with automakers that doesn’t lend itself to this kind of bootstrapped game. There’s no Ferrari, no Lamborghini, no Alfa, no Honda, no Toyota, and no General Motors brand of any kind, just to name a few. (There’s also no Porsche — which is notoriously finicky with video game licensing — but as with other games, CARS gets around this by using Porsche tuner Ruf instead.) But as cobbled-together as CARS feels in places, I want to believe. It’d be wonderful for the Forza/GT duopoly to get some legitimate competition, and CARS shows promise for catering to a slightly harder-core audience than those mainstream titles typically have. My guess is that CARS feels much more at home on a PC, where controller options are abundant and players have the option of hooking into an SDK that Slightly Mad offers for plugging third-party apps and utilities into the game. (A handful of these apps are already available for download.) As for the console versions, the onus is on them to solve — quickly, if possible — a laundry list of loose ends and to build out the anemic database of cars.",0.36919358156741255,0.6308064184325874,0.16234246429900623,1218,4.8185550082101809,624,6.2980769230769234,0,12,"Gaming, Transportation, Games Review"

Did he have to do some special driver workout to keep it in shape? I mean, he retired a while ago, so does he still do it now?   These are the thoughts passing through my mind as I hurtle down the backstretch of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway at 180 miles per hour, cradled above the blurring asphalt by a few inches of carbon fiber, cloth, and a fire suit. I’m buckled snugly into the back half of one of the special two-seater cars that IndyCar uses to thrill anyone with a few hundred dollars to burn. A Honda engine howls just inches behind me, and in front is the man with arguably the most famous name in motorsports history. I’m lucky enough to be here on assignment, marking what will surely be my most exciting Wednesday morning ever. For Mario Andretti, 45 years my senior, this is just another day — wake up, drink some coffee, head to the track, and drive a few suckers around until their heads spin. At three times the speed limit, Indy’s straightaways put me in a state of almost fearless euphoria. But that all goes to shit in the turns, where the centrifugal forces send my breakfast flying up into the right side of my ribcage. I spend the first lap trying to fight the overwhelming forces imposed by the big, sweeping, 9-degree banked turns, but by the second lap I’ve given up. My head flails helplessly in the wind. I just grin and bear it, enjoying what little time I have left on the famous 2.5-mile oval.   As much as I’ve dreamt of driving a race car as a kid, I’m suddenly realizing there’s a better chance of us finding alien life in our solar system than there is of me lasting through 200 laps of the abuse I’m taking. I came to Indianapolis because I want to learn a little bit more about what it’s like to drive an IndyCar. Having grown up down the hill from an asphalt track that features its own special breed of open-wheel racing, I’ve followed the sport for most of my life. I feel close to it in a way that I can never feel for its rowdier stock car cousin, NASCAR. IndyCar has run five races so far this year, but the season symbolically begins in earnest this Sunday with the 99th running of the Indy 500. And on the cusp of its centennial, IndyCar — like other major motorsports — is facing unprecedented uncertainty. All those other race series have implemented some rather radical changes over the last decade as they try to maintain old fans and attract new ones, all while our internet-addled attention spans winnow. But nothing is working particularly well. NASCAR introduced its own version of ""playoffs"" in 2004 and hasn’t stopped toying with the format since. The series also introduced a rear wing on its cars in 2007, which it removed three seasons later. More recently, Formula One dropped its engines from eight cylinders to six in 2014, the sound of which still irks longtime fans. IndyCar has also made its fair share of changes. This season, the series introduced wild-looking modular aerodynamics packages for both its road and oval courses, modifying a new chassis adopted in 2012 that has been criticized as ""cookie-cutter."" The series is also working on rolling out LED panels on the cars that display the drivers’ positions in real time. (They were supposed to be implemented in time for the Indy 500, but have since been delayed.)   With most of its races happening on Sundays, IndyCar is locked in a weekly ratings battle with the likes of NASCAR. Both series are often relegated to sports channels like Fox Sports 1 and NBC Sports Network, and the conclusions of their seasons bump up against the behemoth NFL. The rivalry runs deeper than just ratings; a few years ago, NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon and IndyCar Driver Tony Kanaan traded barbs over which series draws more fans. They can jab all they want, but the reality is that both series have seen attendance struggles. Last year’s 500 — aired on ABC — drew the race’s third-lowest television audience ever. But this year’s race will likely draw more, because those new aerodynamic kits have the cars going faster. In the earliest practices last week, drivers were reaching such incredible speeds that many thought Arie Luyendyk’s 20-year-old track record of 237.498 miles per hour was in danger. Luyendyk can rest easy, though, because IndyCar effectively limited the cars’ qualifying power after a series of increasingly spectacular wrecks during Indy 500 practice and qualifying. Hours after my ride in the two-seater, Helio Castroneves — who was turning the fastest laps of the day at the time — slammed into the wall exiting turn one, spun around backwards, and flew a few hundred feet down the track upside-down. (Fortunately, he was uninjured.) One day later, Josef Newgarden hit and flipped in a similar fashion, and a few days after that Ed Carpenter did the same. This week, James Hinchcliffe went airborne when a suspension part broke on his car. While the other drivers walked away, Hinchcliffe landed in an Indianapolis operating room. If high speeds are increasing the excitement, they’re also magnifying the danger.   The Penske Racing team watches the first replay of Helio Castroneves' wild crash. The wrecks at Indy have drawn a lot of attention, but these accidents aren’t any different from ones we’ve seen in the past. Despite the gruesome injury Hinchcliffe suffered, the cars — and especially the drivers’ cockpits — are much safer now than they were when Dan Wheldon died in a horrific multi-car accident at Las Vegas Motor Speedway back in 2011. If the new aero kits present any problem, it’s likely a much different one; at the sport’s opening event in St. Petersburg, Florida, one of the many pieces on the extraordinarily complex road kit flew off and struck a spectator, fracturing her skull. (A lawsuit has been filed.) But at speed, drivers can’t afford existential crises about the future of their sport — they’ve got other things to worry about. It’s always been easy to recognize the extreme danger that any type of open wheel racing presents from your couch, but it’s hard to fully understand the brutal forces they’re dealing with. Until my two laps around the track, I thought I had at least some idea. I was wrong. I’m still wondering how my legendary driver, at 74 years young so effortlessly manages the forces that would wither my 29-year-old frame. I never got a good look at that neck of his, because as soon as my ride was done, the next poor sap hopped in the two-seater. His visor flipped down, Andretti kicked the throttle, spun the tires, and off they drove.",0.3835436457619731,0.6164563542380269,0.8400489731730693,1156,4.7448096885813147,643,5.8320373250388799,0,12,"Transportation, Report"

According to San Francisco's KGO-TV, both police and dealerships in the area are aware of the growing trend, in which criminals smash the car's rear windows before cutting the cables connecting the battery and lifting it free from the trunk. The batteries weigh about 120 pounds and reportedly take around an hour to remove by trained professionals, but according to police, the thieves have been able to remove them in around 20 minutes. It's not entirely clear what kickstarted the spate of battery thefts, but Yahoo Autos speculates the demand for the tech might be rising because first-generation Priuses, bought around a decade ago, are nearing the end of their battery warranties. The batteries can be cut out in about 20 minutes Replacements from official sources can cost up to $3,000, while second-hand batteries are a literal steal, reportedly going for under $1,000 on Craiglist. The lack of an identification number on hybrid batteries reduces the risk in stealing them, but if the thieves are boosting the batteries to sell to owners of older Toyota hybrids, they must be doing some extra work behind the scenes — according to Yahoo Autos, most of the stolen tech has come from the newest third-generation Prius, whose battery is not immediately compatible with first-generation models unless its cells are reassembled in a new housing. The problem isn't yet widespread, but it also isn't just confined to San Francisco — battery thefts have also been reported in Sacramento and, across the country, in New York. In February, the NYPD reported that it had recorded 14 incidents of hybrid battery theft since November 2014, the majority of which were stolen from yellow cabs.

McLaren told the Top Gear site that it's also possible to convert the Longtail for road use, although looking at the history of roadworthy F1s, this might not really be the best idea.

Joseph Rosa, who curated Behar’s 2004 show at SF MOMA and is now director of the University of Michigan Museum of Art, says Behar’s designs are linked by “a quality of thinking.” As he put together the exhibition, Rosa was impressed by the way Behar brought together so many disparate partners in his work: people who worked in plastics, and furniture, and fashion. “He made these relationships to make the work take place,” Rosa says. “The older generation said, ‘I’m a designer, here’s a design, you figure out how to make it.’ Yves would figure out how to make it and then go find them the manufacturers to do it.”   Nicholas Negroponte chose Behar as his designer for the One Laptop Per Child project, which offers inexpensive laptops and tablets to children in developing countries. He says of Behar: “It is easy to imagine his place in history as the bridge between objects and behaviors, elegance and wit, well beyond form and function.” Here are a few of our favorite Behar designs. Read our full profile of Yves Behar here! Introduced in 2010, the deceptively simple Jawbone Jambox launched the wireless speaker market. Created from non-woven polyester and cardboard, the Clever Little Bag is easily recyclable. Manufacturing of the Clever Little Bag, as opposed to traditional packaging, reduced water and energy consumption by more than 60 percent yearly. The rugged, economic, and aesthetically friendly XO laptop was designed to be distributed as a low-cost educational tool for children across the world. More than 2 million have been produced. The Vue watch is as much an aesthetically pleasing timepiece as it is a commentary on the nature of time: the passing hours fade from the watch’s face, never to return. Behar’s design of the SodaStream Play simplified the original design. Designed in partnership with the Mexican government as part of an initiative to provide durable eyewear for students who can’t afford glasses, the Ver Bien design incorporates flexible Grilamid plastic. Behar’s Fuseproject lab reimagined the Nivea logo, using the company’s iconic blue tin containers as inspiration. Redesigned packaging also reduced weight and material use, creating a more environmentally friendly product. Tasked with creating a remote health-care diagnostic device, Behar’s fuseprojects created Kernel, a palm-sized amulet that can read blood, saliva, urine, and breath and transmit data back to a medical center. Behar’s Up wristband tracks sleeping, eating, exercise, and activity patterns on a daily basis and offers tips for healthier living. Using the same concept behind suspension bridges, the Sayl Chair is frameless, offering airy, flexible support. Behar brought his penchant for metrics to golf with Game Golf, a discrete system that uses sensors embedded in the club to shed statistical light on a player’s every shot. Behar’s August design revamps standard door locks, converting them into digital portals you can control remotely from smartphones and laptops. One Laptop per Child, Tablet: Much like the XO Laptop, the tablet offers a cheaper, sturdier solution for students in developing countries. Earlier this year, PayPal introduced a new, more compact Behar-designed logo. “It’s time for things to be more compact,” Behar said in an interview about the redesign. Behar offered an understated design for a product — a cup that can detect its contents — that took seven years and cost tens of millions of dollars to produce.

But can his good taste conquer the world?  Yves Behar is taking questions.  Behar, the renowned industrial designer, is standing in a glass-enclosed conference room at Art Basel, the Swiss art fair, as part of a business trip to Europe. He began in France at Cannes Lion, the annual festival for advertisers, and will finish in London, where he’ll debut his new line of furniture for Herman Miller. Today Behar is speaking on a panel with the kitchen-sink title of “New Technologies, Human Experiences, and Ethics: Discussing Design’s Future.” As it begins, he settles into his chair and faces the audience.  About 50 people of all ages crowd into the room to hear Behar discuss his work with the aid of slides. “The secret,” he says, “is in the relationship between the person and the object.”   Since moving to California in 1990, Behar has become one of the leading industrial designers of his generation, creating iconic objects for Jawbone, Herman Miller, General Electric, and Puma, among many others. The objects often have a socially progressive bent: light fixtures that promote energy conservation, say, or cheap but durable laptops that offer poor children improved access to education. Behar’s designs tend to be practical rather than flashy, and they have a history of predicting — or dictating — mass-market trends. His design for the Jambox, first released in 2010, launched a multibillion-dollar wireless-speaker market.  Lanky and handsome at 47, Behar keeps fit with a regimen of surfing and yoga. In a crowd he is most easily spotted by his wild tangle of brown hair, now graying at the edges, which adds a dash of mad scientist to an otherwise manicured appearance. His style is Silicon Valley dressed for a date: a fitted chambray shirt over dark denim, cuffed at the bottom. On his left wrist he wears a neon orange Up band, which he designed, and complements it with a colorful pair of surf-shop woven bracelets. Industrial design is a curious profession. Its practitioners are not quite artists, though they are artistic; they are not inventors, though they are inventive; and they are not engineers, though the best of them bring a deep technical understanding to their work. Working freelance or in-house, industrial designers marry art and science to improve the look, feel, and function of lamps, chairs, razors and even corporate logos — anything meant to serve a practical function. Good industrial design makes a thing look good, and great industrial design builds a relationship between an object and its owner. You use it again and again. You fall in love. Weeks after he returns from Europe, the value of Behar’s work will become clear when he sells 75 percent of his industrial design firm, Fuseproject, to a six-year-old Chinese conglomerate named BlueFocus. BlueFocus paid a reported $46.7 million for its stake, and plans to expand Behar’s model of ""venture design"" — forming long-term partnerships with startups in exchange for equity in the companies — around the world. With new capital in the bank and an eager international audience, Behar’s bid to redesign the world is about to go global.  In public Behar speaks softly, and his sentences bear the occasional hesitation of someone for whom English is a second language. (His first is French, and he is also fluent in Italian and German.) In English, Behar will sometimes cut off a sentence halfway through and begin again, or give up after conveying the general idea. Onstage and in interviews, Behar’s attitude is one of polite forbearance — the child made to sit still for a portrait. When he listens, he sometimes removes his Up band and turns it over in his hands. If a question particularly interests him, he grows more animated, illustrating his thoughts with gestures. His hands roll forward like waves, one thought proceeding neatly to the next, a tide of answers coming in to shore. He grows most animated when discussing the Up, which was among the first fitness trackers of its kind. Most products created by designers are used relatively infrequently by their owners — the lemon zester you buy and then pull out twice a year. But devices tied to smartphones are different. People who wear the Up open its companion app an average of 20 times a week. ""Frequency of use is off the charts,"" Behar says. ""It becomes an incredible way for us designers to connect."" The technology still feels primitive — the Up tallies things like steps taken or hours slept, and then shows them on a screen. But its wavelike texture and bold colors convey motion in a way that turns the device into a statement. It says: I take care of myself. Behar believes the future belongs to objects like Up, which give people more control over their lives through sophisticated but subtle applications of technology. He’s broadly interested in ""moving design closer to the body,"" through objects that adapt to you over time. ""Our principal role as designers is to accelerate new ideas, and the adoption of new ideas,"" he says to the audience at Basel. ""This is a way to do that."" Behar’s trip to Switzerland is a homecoming; he grew up 120 miles away in Lausanne. Among the attendees of his panel are his parents, Henry and Christine, and an aunt who is visiting from Turkey. Behar’s aesthetic mission has extended even to his parents’ home in Lausanne, where he disliked the chairs so much that he recently told his mother to get rid of them on the promise he would replace them. She complied with this request, but he has yet to replace any of the chairs months later, and if you find yourself introduced to Christine Behar she may relay this information to you within the first few minutes of your conversation. (He has since designed some chairs for her.) Behar’s longtime girlfriend, art advisor Sabrina Buell, is here in Switzerland as well. She’s traveled to Europe with Behar and their daughters, three-year-old Sylver and six-week-old Soleyl. Behar also has a seven-year-old son, Sky, from a previous relationship. (His parents chose a ""Y"" name for Yves in honor of Henry, and he has continued the tradition with his own children.) Though Behar retains his Swiss citizenship, in most ways he is a fully assimilated Californian: the surfing, the yoga, the utopian embrace of technology. Even his own countrymen can seem wary of him — when Behar checks into his hotel room, which Buell has reserved under her name, the front desk refuses him, thinking him a potential imposter. ""The Swiss,"" Behar says, ""can be very difficult."" After the panel, Behar shakes hands with design students from the audience, takes their business cards and autographs a festival program. I had traveled to Europe to see Behar at work, and when he spots me after his talk, he invites me to join as he and his family browse the art collection across Art Basel’s courtyard. Inside the gallery, a wire sculpture catches Behar’s eye. The untitled work, by the artist Fred Sandback, consists of a piece of elastic cord and steel snaking out of a wall to form a three-dimensional rectangle, 102 inches long, hovering in space. The sculpture, which Sandback completed in 1968, represents the kind of minimalism that is easily dismissed. You could have made that, Behar’s mother says to his father in French. But to Behar, the wire resonates because of its radical simplicity. It is, he says, something to aspire to. ""It’s about creating a maximum effect with the lowest means,"" he says. The work reminds him of his earliest days as a designer, when he couldn’t always afford the materials he wanted, forcing him to improvise. The wire sculpture’s price tag is $450,000. Behar’s father, who is 75, makes a face and sighs. ""I must be getting very old,"" he says. Henry Behar comes from a family of Sephardic Jews who were forced out of the Jewish ghetto in Venice and settled in Turkey. Christine Behar grew up in East Germany, and at the age of 17 escaped into West Berlin via an underground tunnel. They met at a nightclub in London, and married in 1966. Yves was born a year later. As a child, he often played with a hand-me-down Lego set given to him by a cousin. He built houses from the plastic bricks, growing frustrated whenever his creations failed to achieve a perfect symmetry. Behar says he wanted them to look ""resolved."" That play evolved into frequent teenage tinkering in his parents’ garage, and at 16 he decided to pursue design. Three years later he enrolled at the Swiss branch of the Art Center College of Design. By then, he was chafing against his Swiss surroundings: the country seemed increasingly small and closed-minded to him. ""I never felt truly at home in Switzerland,"" he says. He transferred to the main branch of the Art Center in Pasadena, California in 1990. At the time, Behar saw California as little more than a way of escaping Switzerland. But his timing was impeccable. He arrived just as desktop computers were coming to the fore, and Silicon Valley manufacturers were looking to industrial designers to differentiate their anonymous beige PC towers. Upon graduation, Behar moved to San Francisco, where he worked as a junior designer at big firms Lunar Design and Frog. (Among other desktop designs, he worked on the award-winning Pavilion from Hewlett-Packard.) Along the way, Behar absorbed Silicon Valley’s genetic optimism about the social impact of technology. It has since become a hallmark of his work. ""Hollywood tends to have a dystopian view of technology — I think it sells more movies,"" Behar says. ""But I can’t escape the environment I’m in, which is San Francisco, which tends to think in a utopian way about technology. It certainly makes mistakes, but I tend to have a positive view of it."" Behar founded Fuseproject in 1999, with the aim of serving clients who understand what good industrial design can do. The firm’s early work included a perfume bottle, a shampoo bottle that he designed for his hairstylist, and a recycleable shoe with an intuitive microchip designed for an exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The shampoo bottle won a design award, and the shoe brought Behar wide attention. His roster of clients multiplied, and in 2004, just five years after starting his own firm, he had solo shows at SF MOMA and in Lausanne. As the demand for Behar has grown, Fuseproject has swelled to more than 70 employees. If you value thoughtfully designed tools and have some disposable income, there’s a decent chance that something from Yves Behar’s imagination is in your house, in your office, or on your wrist. Along the way Behar has become a wealthy man, although it’s hard to say exactly how wealthy: the startups he has worked with most closely have yet to go public. He stands to make millions from the partial sale of Fuseproject, and will remain CEO, promising that very little will change in the day-to-day running of the company. ""Overall,"" he says, ""it’s an ambition to make design central to more businesses. And it’s a recognition that there’s much more work to do in that sense, internationally.""  ""What Yves is really good at is asking questions relentlessly,"" says Jason Johnson, his co-founder at August, a home automation company. ""He will just ask, ‘Can we make this a little bit smaller? Can we make this a little more fluid?’ He will ask questions that will force the people in the room to either say, ‘No,’ or, ‘That’s impossible,’ which he’ll challenge."" Gilles BianRosa, who hired Fuseproject to design the Fan TV set-top box, watched Behar throw out a design for the accompanying remote control the team had worked on for months. The remote felt great to hold, but problems with the materials interfered with the box’s electronics. After puzzling over a solution, Behar told everyone they would have to start over. ""I remember Yves’ team looking at him and saying, ‘Holy shit!’"" BianRosa says. ""Even my own team looked at him thinking, ‘What?!’ Because it was crazy for both our timeline and Fuseproject’s timeline. And yet we said fuck it, we’re doing it from scratch. If we’re trying to invent the remote of the future, we’re not going to compromise."" Of course, nearly every design winds up being a compromise of some sort. The plastic you want turns out to be too expensive, or the casing needs to be bigger to fit all the sensors, or there’s a seam running along the bottom because working from a single sheet of metal proves to be impossible. (The seam underneath the Big Jambox, which is the first Behar object I ever bought and still probably my favorite, continues to bother him.) In the case of the final Fan TV remote, though, any compromises are obscured. It’s a glossy, white, touch-enabled pebble that fits neatly in the hand. It snaps, via magnet, onto the accompanying set-top box, and the shape of the remote mirrors that of the box. Behar objects often make ingenious use of textures, causing their look to change slightly depending on the light. The result is often a thing you feel compelled to touch. Most remote controls you want to hurl across the room in frustration; this one you want to slip in your pocket. Johnson, of August, says Behar is successful because of his poise. ""He’s very in control emotionally,"" he says. ""Because he’s not raising the temperature of the room, nobody else does, either. You never get into a shouting match."" But Hosain Rahman, the founder of Jawbone, says Behar can be combative. ""I don’t qualify him as zen or docile,"" Rahman says. ""We have a great relationship, but we can fight. I used to tease people that if Yves doesn’t threaten to quit on a project, that means we’re not doing our best work."" Behar, who is Jawbone’s chief creative officer, allows that he and his Fuseproject colleagues ""are not known as being yes-men and yes-women."" ""I don’t think you can practice what we do without a strong vision,"" he says. When he meets with resistance, he often tells his clients that ""there is no time for average work."" Behar also repeats the mantra Pixar adopted when it decided to rewrite Toy Story 2 from scratch eight months before its release: Pain is temporary, but suck is forever. When a design finally comes together, he says, ""the pain is forgotten. What lasts is the quality of the work.""   After spending the weekend in Lausanne, Behar flies to London on Monday morning for two days of meetings. Around noon, he stops at the Ace Hotel in central London for lunch with Lucas Dietrich, the long-suffering editor of his book project. Dietrich, an American who works at the art-focused publishing house Thames and Hudson, has been working with Behar on a retrospective of his design work that will showcase its impact around the world. Dietrich’s pitch to Behar was somewhat unusual — ""I said, this will be agony for you and me both,"" he recalls — and Behar agreed. That was seven years ago. Behar flatly rejects the latest designs for the book, which he reviews on his iPhone: it looks too much like a documentary of his design process, he says, and not enough like a magazine spread. He would like it to look more ""editorial."" Dietrich nods vigorously and assures Behar it will be handled. A taxi takes Behar across town to meet Nadja Swarovski, an executive at the family-owned crystal empire that bears her name. Swarovski, who was raised in Europe and America, is beloved among designers for her willingness to spend big on custom art projects to promote the family brand. In 2007, Behar designed a chandelier of 16,000 Swarovski crystals that changed shape when you traced your fingers along a nearby touchpad. Later, he designed an environmentally friendly chandelier consisting of a single crystal illuminated by an LED light. Along the way, he and Swarovski have become friends. Swarovski greets Behar with a hug, her hand revealing a ring with a crystal the size of an unshelled walnut. They talk of her recent purchase of a home in suburban London — it’s close enough to the country club that she can have meals sent over to the house. But soon they get to the point: Swarovski wants to discuss an exhibition for the London Design Festival in September. She would like it to involve drones. Behar lays out a vision involving a dozen or so autonomous drones, laden with Swarovski crystal, circling in formation above the courtyard of the Victoria and Albert Museum at night. The drones will move in a programmed ballet, ultimately uniting to form a temporary chandelier, lit up and spinning above the heads of festivalgoers. Swarovski loves it. A few minutes into the conversation, a severe-looking woman named Irene Schiebel steps into the conference room. She has been summoned in the hopes that her family’s drone business, which is based in Austria, can supply vehicles for Behar’s aerial ballet. Behar asks about the types of drone that Schiebel has available. ""We have one drone,"" she says, curtly. This would be the massive Camcopter S-100. With a wingspan of more than 11 feet, and a price upwards of $4 million, it’s immediately clear that Schiebel’s product is both too large and too expensive for their needs. Swarovski frowns, but Behar humors Schiebel with more questions. Finally, Swarovski says they’ll call her later in the week. Schiebel, stonefaced, says her week is very busy, as is next week, and that afterward she will be on vacation for the rest of the summer. She has no questions about the scope of the project, and seems vaguely annoyed at being asked to attend the meeting. When she leaves the room, Behar and Swarovski look at one another in wonderment. ""That was phenomenal,"" Behar says. From there they share a cab to the museum, where they are to meet with various officials about drone logistics. A burly gentleman who runs an aerial photography company leads the conversation. Ruddy-faced and shaped like a bowling ball, he quickly knocks down Behar’s ideas. No, you cannot program the drones to fly autonomously — too dangerous. No, they cannot circle majestically overhead — they must be protected from the crowd by a large net. As the dream of a drone chandelier falls apart, Swarovski makes a pained expression, and leaves the gathering to get some air. Behar remains calm, asking questions in hopes of devising a workable alternative, before requesting more time to think. As he goes to offer a parting thought, the drone man interrupts again. ""One more thing to think about,"" he says, and points to the cloudy London sky. ""These things don’t do rain.""  On Tuesday morning, Behar walks a short distance from his London hotel to the Royal College of Surgeons, where Herman Miller is staging an event. Miller is a 108-year-old company that has no in-house designers; instead it contracts with a handful of marquee talents around the world. The most famous of these were the modernists Charles and Ray Eames, who rose to prominence in the 1940s and ’50s after pioneering the use of molded plywood, fiberglass, plastic resin, and wire mesh in their furniture. Charles Eames is a source of enduring inspiration to Behar, who often quotes one of his mottos: ""The best for the most for the least."" (He never quotes another of Eames’ mottos: ""Innovate as a last resort."") On this day, Behar is presenting his new line of furniture to 180 Herman Miller sales executives from around the world. In back-to-back, hour-long lectures, Behar lays out the Living Office, a suite of furniture designed to encourage collaboration. Its centerpiece, the social desk, includes a seat at every workstation that invites a colleague to sit down. In his team’s investigations of modern work, Behar found that 70 percent of office collaborations happen deskside, even though desks often lack seating for a second person. So Fuseproject designed a set of furniture, based largely on its own working patterns, to facilitate quick check-ins. Behar is a low-key salesman. His presentation is filled with slides from his own office, where his team has been testing the prototypes extensively over the past year. He methodically shows the evolution of the desk from cardboard prototype to finished project, emphasizing how they encourage collaboration. Herman Miller is an ideal partnership for Behar: it gives him creative freedom, it’s lucrative, and it burnishes his design credentials. When the day is done, in the back of another taxi, Behar says he ultimately wants to be known as someone who brings projects like this to life. ""For me, it’s not about being the best designer,"" he says. ""I’m interested in being the best partner. The best collaborator."" Behar has been asked many times to become an in-house designer, including by what he describes as ""grade-A"" technology firms, but has always declined in order to maintain his creative freedom. (He won’t say which companies approached him, but if you ask if Apple is among them, he will make a tortured face and quickly change the subject.) The taxi pulls up at the Serpentine Gallery in Hyde Park. For the past 14 years, the gallery has chosen relatively unknown artists to build sculptures on its grounds. Previous honorees have included Frank Gehry and Rem Koolhaas; this year the gallery chose Smiljan Radić, a Chilean architect best known for his unusual houses. Tonight is the installation’s opening, and the London art world has turned out for the occasion. Radić’s creation is a large, khaki-colored, vaguely organic form with openings cut at odd angles. Just inside, rope lighting zig-zags overhead, giving Radić’s structure the impression of a nightclub fashioned out of a giant mushroom. Behar is well known to many in the crowd, including a handful of journalists, who buttonhole Behar with tape recorders to ask him his thoughts on the structure. (He likes it.) Behar chats happily. His shoulders relax, and he smiles easily and trades stories with his fellow guests over a glass of pinot grigio. An archetypal London rainstorm breaks out, drawing everyone back into Radić’s mushroom. Soon, a small crowd has gathered around Behar, who is talking once again about the future, and the incredible power that devices with embedded sensors will soon have to make us feel better and live longer. Behar talks about his father’s asthma, and how doctors say physical activity can improve the condition. ""But nobody checks whether you’re physically active!"" Like so much in the present day, this simply will not do. Behar raises his hand to reveal the Up band on his wrist. He points at the band and grins ear to ear, as the crowd leans in. ""With this,"" he says, ""it’s easy!"" Photography by Ike Edeani.

I cycle between various bits of abstract art and concepts for weird new spaceships, but it usually doesn't feel quite right.  It's hard to make something that doesn't look amazing Crystals for iOS is the perfect solution to my problem. It's an app that lets you make slick and colorful images made of polygons, simply with a touch of your finger. Tapping the screen will create the tip of a polygonal crystal, splitting the screen into triangles, and with multiple taps you can create complex crystalline images. Each tap is emphasized with a satisfying ding, and there are a bunch of different color options that can dramatically change how things look. The most impressive thing is that it's pretty hard to make something that doesn't look amazing: Crystals is more of a visual toy than a proper art tool, and it's a lot of fun to play with. Once you complete an image there isn't much you can do other than save it or export it as a PDF or SVG file for tinkering in another program. Crystals for iOSPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext The app's simplicity and playful nature is intentional. Crystals was created by Jan Peter, the German designer behind Isometric, another iOS tool that made it relatively easy to create wonderful geometric art. But making something in Isometric takes considerably more effort than Crystals. ""When I started developing Isometric, I thought of it as a tool for designers and only later realized that most people just like to play around with it. They think of it more as a creativity game rather than a tool,"" explains Peter. ""So my goal with Crystals was to make it even easier to be creative, while still allowing creative professionals further edit the designs as vector graphics."" Crystals is free to download on iOS, with $3 worth of in-app purchases to add new color options (you also get a few bonuses if you already own Isometric). It's far from the most robust art tool, but that's really not the point: it's just a great way to zone out while making pretty pictures. ""I hope people have fun and can relax while using these apps,"" Peters says of his work, which may soon include a third app involving dots.

The massive sports network, owned by the Walt Disney Company, said in a statement provided to Recode that Verizon's new bundles ""would not be authorized by our existing agreements."" The statement continues, ""Among other issues, our contracts clearly provide that neither ESPN nor ESPN2 may be distributed in a separate sports package."" The contracts that your cable provider signs to bring your favorite channels to your home often have many stipulations — most programmers, for instance, require that their powerhouse channels be offered alongside their less popular offerings. Extremely powerful networks, like ESPN, can even mandate that its channels are included in the most widely distributed cable packages. ESPN says custom bundles ""would not be authorized by our existing agreements."" Verizon's announcement was somewhat noteworthy because it appeared to sidestep such stipulations, but now it seems that the operator may have jumped the gun before coming to agreements with its programming partners. The new customizable FiOS packages appear to violate ESPN's rules, as the sports network's channels are not included in the base TV bundle of 35 channels. Customers on the new plan get the base channels, broadband internet, and two additional add-on bundles for $65 per month. ESPN's channels are relegated to a separate sports package, which can either be counted against the two included bundles or can be added on for an extra $10 per month. There are a total of seven add-on bundles. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, FiOS president Tami Erwin said that the company designed the new plans such that it ""expects to be in a position of compliance"" with its programming contracts. But going off of ESPN's statement, it seems Verizon announced the new plans before hammering out all of the details in negotiations. It's possible the company used a public announcement as a bargaining move in an attempt to force an agreement.

I don’t have any data on inflation in salaries, but it seems like the expectations around salary and equity are 20 to 30 percent higher this year than last year, and the same is true for the year before that."" Butterfield explains that hitting the magic mark of a billion dollar valuation, a unicorn in today's startup parlance, is also a psychological threshold that helps with hiring and customer acquisition. A billion dollar valuation is table stakes for top talent Along with the cost for talent, the price of real estate is also spiking in San Francisco.  ""We just moved out of our temp office. That was $62 a square foot when we first rented it, and now nine months later we can sublet it for $75 per square foot."" While he insists that the funding is far more than Slack needs for day-to-day operations, Butterfield believes it's important in case a big opportunity presents itself. ""The money is useful in terms of creating options. Just cause we aren’t going to immediately spend it doesn’t mean it wouldn’t be great when we find a company we want to acquire."" What are the margins like on the company? ""We're growing so fast it's very hard to know,"" Butterfield said. The financial model might change if Slack decides to start spending anything on sales or marketing. Right now it's just spreading by word of mouth. Slack claimed 73,000 paying customers back in October of 2014. It says it has over 200,000 now. ""The margins are like any other enterprise software company, which is to say, they are very good."" A war chest in case you need to wait out a winter I asked Butterfield if he was concerned that the rapidly ballooning valuation of the company might outstrip what it can fetch at a public offering. There have been several enterprise software companies recently that found themselves underwater after their IPO. He acknowledged it was a danger, but pointed to the success of Etsy, a company in which he was an early investor, as an example of thinking long term. ""Is it something to be concerned about? Yes. But the way things are now, we have an indefinite amount of time before we have to go public. With this money, we can wait a decade if we have to, until the timing makes sense."" What would the impact be if this bubble were to pop? Butterfield believes it wouldn't be anything like the dot-com crash, pointing out that the total size of startup investments each year, roughly $50 billion, is just a fraction of our larger financial markets. ""Will our growth slow down, of course, it's the law of large numbers,"" he admits. ""But right now it's crazy. We keep doubling in size. It's hard to wrap your head around."" The rest of the world is thinking the same thing.",0.6325517423278273,0.3674482576721727,0.5663811016171432,759,4.6100131752305664,427,5.5152224824355969,0,0,"Business, Tech, Interview"

Last summer, San Francisco-based company Airware announced its intentions to build a platform to help make it easier for companies to deploy drones, and today the company is formally launching its Aerial Information Platform — a standardized drone operating system that could make it far simpler for companies to deploy and manage fleets of drones.  ""For drones to be used in a growing number of applications across a number of industries, there needs to be a platform,"" Airware CEO and founder Jonathan Downey said at a press briefing held in the middle of a farm in northern California — a space ideal for doing some drone tests. ""The idea [behind Airware] was that we would support a wide variety of vehicles required to address the myriad of different applications for which drones will be a key part of the solution."" Downey’s vision is that any drone running the Airware platform can be configured, deployed, and run the same way as any other — even if the vehicle itself is a completely different drone build by a different company for another purpose. Airware believes a standard platform is needed for drones to really work for businesses  To make that happen, Airware spent the last four years building what it calls the Aerial Information Platform — a system that encompasses both software and hardware that standardizes the drone experience for a company. The first piece of that puzzle is the ""flight core"" — a hardware autopilot box that can be attached to a drone that runs Airware’s flight software.    The flight core then communicates from the drone with operators on the ground running Airware’s two different software solutions. The Ground Control Station program lets you build your flight plan, set geofences and contingency plans for the drone, and basically tweak anything related to the in-flight mission the drone will carry out. The farm provided a perfect venue for showing off the software — Airware’s CTO Buddy Michini set up a geofence over the farm, dictated how high and fast the drone would fly, built a flight plan for surveying the area and shooting photos every second, and then launched a test drone to carry out his instructions.  There’s also a higher-level configuration manager that lets administrators build out bigger projects with specific goals — that can all be then sent down to the Ground Control program where the actual operators will carry out their jobs. While there’s no doubt that the demonstration Airware showed off made things look as simple as possible, it did feel highly approachable, with a relatively simple learning curve. That’s by design — Airware said it looked at the UIs for various drone programs and found most were designed for pilots or engineers, whereas the Airware system is designed to be easily approachable by the employees it expects to carry out these tasks.    As for the kinds of companies that might deploy such a system, Airware had two partners on hand — GE (who is also an investor in the company) and telecommunications company Infinigy. When talking about Infinigy, Downey noted that 13 people died in 2013 while carrying out cell phone tower inspections — so Infinigy hopes to use drones to replace people when doing basic checks on towers, saving humans for only situations in which repair or other actual physical work is needed.  GE didn’t talk specifics about how it might use drones, Downey said that the company was working with utility companies to utilize drones to check power lines and equipment against vegetation encroachment. And manufacturer Drone America is already building drones that can deliver lifeboats in emergencies as well as carry out search-and-rescue missions.  Can Airware become for drones what Android is for smartphones? While Airware is only rolling out the flight core and its two software platforms today, the company has more planned. The ""app core"" will let third parties write plug-ins for the Ground Control software that could expand a drone’s capabilities when it launches in the coming months, and Airware is also launching a cloud-based platform for managing a company’s drone fleet in ways that extend beyond simple missions — it’ll help companies (and its end users) deal with the insurance and government compliance requirements needed for managing a drone fleet. The cloud platform will also make it easy to analyze the various sensor data gathered by a drone flight and share it within an organization. It’s the early days for Airware, and the company is a rather unique entity in the drone space, so it isn’t trying to rush its new drone operating system out there — the company is working with a handful of manufacturers now, and says that it is currently targeting the ""top 50"" commercial drone manufacturers for potential partnerships. It remains to be seen if those drone manufacturers — as well as the companies who need the drones for their work — will find Airware’s platform to be worth the cost ($2,500 per drone, per year).  But in a new market with no real status quo, Airware is betting that it can become the universal drone OS across all hardware makers. That’s easier said than done though — some analysts are already imagining a world in which hardware quickly becomes commoditized, with software being the differentiator. ""Next year and the year after that, you’re going to see hundreds of DJI clones,"" Chris Dixon, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz (an investor in Airware), told The Wall Street Journal yesterday. ""I don’t think long term that’s a good bet...Software is going to eat drones."" For the moment, at least, Airware’s got the head start in the race to find what could become for drones what Android is for smartphones.",0.5289718027829572,0.4710281972170428,0.8431272482927682,1006,4.9821073558648115,501,6.1716566866267462,0,4,"Business, Tech"

The stock was priced at $16 a share but immediately jumped to $32 when it opened. While it's not yet profitable, Etsy has seen its revenue surge over the last three years. The company has benefited from extraordinary network effects, word-of-mouth marketing, and customer loyalty that stems from its focus on empowering the creators of handmade goods. How do you define hand made?  How exactly to define what belongs on Etsy has become a contentious issue. Some successful sellers have been accused of stocking their stores with pre-fab items purchased from Alibaba. Even the CEO has mistakenly endorsed mass produced products. But its brand continues to hold weight with consumers. An analysis of its financials shows that for every $100 of sales that occurred on Etsy’s platform, it spent just $1-2 on marketing, performance its peers in ecommerce would kill for. The company has also sought to differentiate itself by becoming a ""B Corp"", making clear to investors that it values its community and the environment as highly as it does profits. And it set aside a portion of its pre-IPO shares for sellers, allowing them to participate in the potential wealth creation of taking the company public. A stark contrast to the Silicon Valley startup bubble Despite the company's impressive revenues, its market value it dwarfed by many still private Silicon Valley companies like Pinterest and Snapchat that have little or no revenue to speak of. Recently many tech investors have been warning that these enormous private valuations may leave some companies underwater when they go public, as happened with Box, which was worth less after its IPO than it was after its last funding round.   Etsy has always played the game differently. Its CEO, Chad Dickerson, believes that allows it to attract top talent who are burnt out on the culture of Silicon Valley and the relentless pursuit of the most money. ""Part one of Etsy’s values is ‘keeping it real,’"" noted Mike Grishaver, who left Pandora to become Etsy's head of product. ""They tend to have people who are pretty humble despite the growth.""

The most recent figures come from Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with as strong a track record as you're likely to see in the Apple guessing game. In a note to investors from Kuo's employer KGI Securities, Kuo estimates that the Apple Watch clocked in global pre-orders of over 2.3 million units. We estimate production of Apple Watch around 2.3mn units in March-May. Mass production of Apple Watch began in March and will likely reach 2.3mn by end of May. Considering that most consumers who preordered will not get the device until June, we estimate global preorders of over 2.3mn units, with Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition representing a respective order allocation of 85%, 15% and less than 1%. Second-guessing Apple is never an exact science These estimates, as published by MacRumors, can be compared with figures publicized earlier this week by a company named Slice Intelligence, which estimated US-only Apple Watch pre-orders of 1.2 million units. Slice's information, however, comes from a rather biased source. The company relies on enthusiastic shoppers signing up for their app to collect data (the app helps customers by keeping track of purchases and stores receipts), which they then turn into country-wide estimates. In this case their sample size was around 9,080 — a little on the small side, especially considering their sign-ups are skewed towards hardcore shoppers. Read next: Read our Apple Watch review. Kuo, by comparison, is a Taiwan-based analyst with proven supply chain sources. His predictions aren't perfect (he claimed that the iPad mini 2 would come with an 8-megapixel camera, for example), but he's had an impressive number of hits over the years. These include correctly predicting the screen size and resolution on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the two sizes for the Apple Watch (though his measurements were out), and the inclusion of Touch ID on the iPad Air 2. It's easy to carp over the details, but Kuo has a better track record than most. As well as 2.3 million pre-orders, he also claims that Apple is aiming to produce 2 to 3 million Watches a month. one million pebble smartwatches have been sold and 720,000 android wear devices If either Kuo or Slice's estimates are right, Apple has already become the biggest player in the smartwatch industry. Solid sales figures for the rest of the market aren't easy to come by either, but in February, Pebble announced it had sold over 1 million smartwatches since 2013. By comparison, over 720,000 Android Wear devices are thought to have been sold in 2014 (the OS only launched in June that year), with Motorola reportedly ""the clear leader"" among the various manufacturers. If Kuo is right about global pre-orders, the Apple Watch has already eclipsed the rest of the entire market. The estimates for the Apple Watch also compare well with the company's previous launches in new product categories. When the first iPad went on sale in 2010 it shifted 300,000 units globally in its first day, before racking up 1 million sales in 28 days. And in 2007, Apple sold 270,000 units of the first iPhone in the US in the first 30 hours, before hitting the 1 million mark in 74 days.",0.6223322652777221,0.3776677347222779,0.8322804837427965,561,4.9465240641711228,317,5.7917981072555209,1,0,"Apple, Business, Tech"

In response, the university appointed an independent investigator, Nardello & Co. Its report is out today, and it found that approximately 10,000 workers who built the Abu Dhabi campus lacked the labor protections NYU had stipulated. Perhaps most disturbing, many workers, including those covered by NYU’s labor guidelines, had their passports taken and held by their employers, impeding the ability of the mostly foreign workforce to leave. Many did not relinquish their passports voluntarily NYU has faced criticism for its Abu Dhabi campus since it was first announced. In 2009, it issued a ""statement of labor values"" designed to give workers better protections than the norm in the UAE. But last year, The New York Times reported that conditions fell far short, with immigrant laborers saying that they'd been asked to pay recruitment fees, parted from their passports, crammed into crowded living conditions, and paid less than promised. Earlier this year, an NYU professor critical of the exploitation of migrant labor in the UAE was barred from entering the country. Passport confiscation and recruitment fees are common tactics in the world of forced or coerced labor. In exchange for the promise of work abroad, workers pay fees that they then struggle to pay off; upon arriving, they then have their passports confiscated, preventing them from leaving. Human rights groups have criticized the UAE and other Gulf states for these practices for several years. Common practice in the world of forced labor The statement released by NYU alludes to the passport issue after saying that its protections didn’t cover many short-term subcontractors. These workers represented approximately one-third of the campus's 30,000 laborers, and NYU says it will compensate them so that their wages are in line with protected workers. But NYU president John Sexton placed greater emphasis on the passport issue in an email sent to faculty and students. ""Even for those construction workers who were covered by the standards, relatively few retained their passports,"" he wrote. ""While many employees covered by the standards said they voluntarily agreed to have their employer hold their passports (and had access to them), such an arrangement conflicted with the publicly stated standard that employees must hold their passport."" In the report, Nardello & Co says that ""more than a quarter"" of the workers they interviewed who were covered by NYU’s labor guidelines ""did not relinquish control of their passports voluntarily."" In his email, which is far more critical than the official statement, Sexton writes that ""there were real lapses,"" particularly in the policy of allowing short-term subcontractors to be exempt from NYU’s labor policies. ""Neither we nor [local partner] Tamkeen knew about the exemption policy or how widely it was being applied,"" Sexton writes. ""We acknowledge the lapses."" Though NYU’s policy was to reimburse any workers who paid recruitment fees, it says that it couldn’t verify that workers had paid fees for the NYU campus project and not a prior one. The university's statement ends by saying that the campus will launch a research project into recruitment fees. The email from Sexton ends on a more apologetic note. ""We acknowledge the lapses, will learn from them, and will attempt to rectify them,"" Sexton wrote. ""I hope our experience on this project can be a useful lesson not just for NYU but for others, too.  For that reason, we think the open publication of this report, with its frank findings, is a valuable, good faith start on that process.""",0.5539586692719584,0.44604133072804164,0.924505876996378,619,5.2584814216478186,337,6.2611275964391693,0,0,"Business, US & World"

Shaheen and campaigners from Women on 20 originally targeted the higher-denomination note for female representation because of current honoree Andrew Jackson's opposition to paper money, and his track record of favoring forceful legislation that subjugated Native Americans.

The first is an overhaul to its Lifeline program, which subsidizes phone service for low-income Americans and should soon also be able to subsidize high-speed internet, furthering the commission's goal of seeing access spread across the country. The second is an update to the commission's robocall rules that will allow service providers to use robocall blocking software to stop spammy calls from reaching their customers. The robocall rules go into effect immediately; the Lifeline overhaul will now be opened up for a comment period before being revised and likely entered into law.  Subsidies go to households near or below the poverty line The Lifeline update is the more important of the two proposals that the FCC approved today. The program currently offers $9.25 per month for phone service to households that are below or only slightly above the poverty line. The idea is that phone service is so critical to daily life — you need it to call for help, to get a job, to stay in touch with the world — that everyone should be able to afford it. Of course, that was more accurate in 1985 when the program was set up. Today, the internet is what fits that description, which is why Lifeline is now being changed to cover broadband. It's an important update for spreading internet access, which is currently limited among low-income households. In 2013, Pew found that only 54 percent of households making under $30,000 a year had broadband. The hope is that Lifeline can go a long way toward changing that. Many Republicans are, unsurprisingly, opposed to the program. Lifeline has even received the nickname ""Obamaphone,"" which is brilliant because the program started under Reagan. The claim is that Lifeline is fraught with fraud and misuse, which is likely why the FCC's proposed update takes steps to add further protections. As far as the robocall update goes, it's largely a series of clarifications and tweaks to the FCC's existing rules. They're a meaningful series of changes, however, as they make it clear what steps phone providers can take to prevent spammy calls, and they remove loopholes that robocallers were using to avoid getting in trouble. One change will make it far easier for people to opt out of robocalls and texts — callers will be required to accept any reasonable request for removal — and another change will require that callers regularly clear old phone numbers from their lists. Spammy calls (and texts) are apparently the issue FCC gets the most complaints about, so these changes could do a lot to help remove that annoyance. That said, there remains some concern among the commissioners about the possibility of robocall blockers stopping the wrong calls. The FCC actually approved a third item at the meeting as well, one meant to increase competition in VoIP. The update makes it easier for VoIP providers to acquire phone numbers, which could in turn reduce costs for subscribers.",0.6518889317033563,0.34811106829664373,0.8361602902092079,501,5.0299401197604787,286,5.8531468531468533,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World"

As the Associated Press reports, the government plans to add Wi-Fi to 35 state-run computer centers across the island, where internet access remains tightly controlled and illegal at home for most Cubans. The state also announced plans to lower the price of Wi-Fi from $4.50 to $2 per hour, in what marks the most significant expansion of web access since President Barack Obama moved to normalize US relations with Cuba late last year. Cuba is one of the least connected countries in the Western hemisphere. The government says about 25 percent of its population has access to the internet, but most of those users are limited to government-approved websites and a handful of services. The pro-democracy group Freedom House says only about 5 percent of Cubans have access to the full web. The $2 Wi-Fi price point would still be prohibitive for most Cubans, who earn an average of $20 per month, but experts say it's an important step in the right direction. Baby steps?

Cuba's communist government has signaled its intent to expand web access in the past. A fiber-optic cable to Venezuela went online in 2013, and the country's first public Wi-Fi center opened earlier this year, offering free internet. A government report that leaked this month outlined plans to bring broadband connections to half of Cuban homes by 2020. Opening the internet has also been a major part of the Obama administration's new approach to Cuba, as the White House moves to loosen export restrictions on services and equipment that could facilitate an expansion. Some American technology companies have shown interest in expanding to the island, as well.

Learn more. Tumblr CEO David Karp met Taylor Swift at her San Francisco show last Friday, and it was an interaction that left both parties glowing. Swift signed a ""no its becky"" T-shirt and a poster for Karp — she called him the ""creator of Tumblr, a.k.a. my world"" — and she posted about the meeting on her Tumblr (where else?) a few days later: ""I met David Karp tonight and he was wearing a ‘No it’s Becky’ t-shirt. It was everything I ever dreamed it would be."" It's a nice story, but it's not unprecedented. There's a proud tradition of pop stars and tech titans coming together in beautiful friendship, one that stretches at least as far back as the first time Steve Jobs and Bono came together to hawk iPods and digital singles. Alicia Keys and former BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins were thick as thieves, so close that she was named the company's ""global creative director"" in 2013; the role didn't last. (She wasn't the only musician with a side hustle doing creative direction: Lady Gaga ended a similar relationship with Polaroid last year.) Goth teen queen Lorde tweeted in defense of ousted Reddit employee Victoria Taylor as the site's management crisis was erupting into a full-fledged conflagration. Swift cajoled Apple into paying artists for plays accrued during Apple Music trial periods with an open letter, but I can only assume the deal was sealed over a long, boozy emergency lunch with Eddy Cue at Margaritaville. Even lesser stars like Christina Aguilera and Keith Urban have friends in technology's high places, as evidenced by their tight link with retired Cisco CEO John Chambers. I'm happy that all of these prominent people have managed to forge totally genuine connections in this zany, hyperconnected world, but I don't think they should have all the fun. With that in mind, I've designed two tools that give us regular folk a window into the world of interdisciplinary friendship. 1. The psychic friendship generator  I have a hidden talent, one I've never shared with anyone before. I have the ability to tap into the universe's hidden rhythms, allowing me to determine beyond the shadow of a doubt when two people are going to become friends. Given the rapidly increasing number of musicians and tech elite coming together in unexpected ways, I've decided to share my special skill with the world at large. I've poured it into the tool below — keep clicking, and a galaxy of future friendships will be revealed.  2. The foolproof personal friendship algorithm What if you're uninterested in the pop-tech friendships that have yet to bloom into glorious color? What if you're feeling... lonely, and looking for a friend yourself? What if you're specifically searching for a tech luminary or prominent businessperson, one with whom you can rent private karaoke rooms and meet for lunchtime Thai? Don't fret: I've got you covered. If you can answer a series of four simple questions, my foolproof friendship algorithm will recommend a new best pal that's perfectly suited to your unique mix of likes and dislikes. I'll give you the name, and I'll guarantee the chemistry — all you have to do is reach out.

By the end of 2012, it was accepted as a historical fact that Carly Rae Jepsen's ""Call Me Maybe"" was objectively the song of 2012. It was one of the few moments in pop music where even would-be detractors and snobs had to shrug and concede its superiority. Everyone loved that song. Everyone sang along to that song. What's more, there was something about that song's success that felt unquestionably earned — no matter the Justin Bieber-abetted machinations to place it in the center of the pop cultural dinner table, most people could hear ""Call Me Maybe"" and feel that the people involved in its creation were good at their jobs. Whatever work had gone into writing that exuberant, endlessly repeatable chorus had paid off; Carly Rae was a star, Scooter Braun was rich, karaoke bars would never be the same. Barely anyone bought Kiss, the rushed-into-production album the song eventually lived on, but in our streaming- and singles-dominated world, who cares? Pop music, like any other mainstream art form, is not a meritocracy, but if it was, Jepsen's follow-up album E•MO•TION would be the biggest, most inescapable pop creation of the year. It's such a competent piece of work, every moving part not only well-oiled but possessing the kind of charisma that not even the most cunning Swedish megaproducer can create in the studio. It in fact does have a cadre of critically respected writers and producers behind it, but when you put on headphones and press play on ""Run Away With Me"" you're not thinking about what a great Shellback hook that is. You're wishing you could run down the streets like Jepsen in the homemade-looking music video, jumping into fountains and sharing the song's uncontainable joy with everyone in the general vicinity.  Right now, that very video is sitting at just shy of 5 million views on YouTube; for comparison, Demi Lovato, who is of a comparable level of celebrity as Jepsen (but still without a world-conquering hit like ""Call Me"" to her name) released her ""Cool For The Summer"" video a week later, and it's now at about 32 million views. I'm a fan of Lovato's; she's at Jepsen's level as far as the pure vocal ability to sell a hook, and she sells the hell out of ""Cool For The Summer."" But what's that 27 million disparity about? Why does Demi get to 19 on the Hot 100 (already modest for a pop song of this ambition) and Carly doesn't chart at all? Why is nobody showing up for this album? Should the absence of a narrative matter when the music is this good? It's mysterious, perhaps even ironic, that as our on-demand modes of consuming media become more and more microscopically tailored to the individual listener or viewer, pop music has become sneakily dependent on the artist — or, more specifically, the narrative surrounding that artist. Bluntly speaking, we don't know anything about Carly Rae Jepsen. She hasn't shared her life with us in the same way that Lovato, Rihanna, or even Beyoncé, that master of strict self-curation, has. And when it comes to selling your story as a product, all those artists are eating the dust of Taylor Swift, whose preplanned ""candid"" paparazzi shoots and carefully leaked gossip tidbits keep her personal saga in business even between album cycles. Like Marvel superhero movies, when a new Taylor Swift song comes out, we come to it with a certain portion of our comprehension meter already filled. Any new music is just another episode in the Taylor Show; it becomes nearly impossible to judge or experience in a vacuum. As dominant as ""Call Me Maybe"" was three years ago, we don't come into E•MO•TION with that same level of precognition on a narrative level. But should the absence of a narrative matter when the music is this good? When those stop-and-freeze downbeats on ""Making the Most of the Night"" hit you like a hairflip? When you're able to sing along to the lovelorn chorus of ""Your Type"" after one listen? I'm not talking about a daring outsider musician not getting her due for her boundary-pushing vision. E•MO•TION is as poppy as pop gets; you'd be hard-pressed to call anything about it experimental. I'm talking about a pop artist showing up and doing her job: at times, even better on a technical level than Swift, who rode that same ‘80's inflected monster-hook wave to break just about every record known to man with last year's 1989.  You don't read these songs like a book, you drum them out on the steering wheel But unlike Swift, Jepsen somehow manages to deflect the spotlight off herself, even though her expressive, persistently-kinda-hoarse voice is ever-present on the album. And that's both what makes these songs so universal, and perhaps what will keep her on the pop sidelines. Carly Rae Jepsen makes songs that are about you, not Carly Rae Jepsen. Lyrically, they're like Cosmopolitan horoscopes; evocative, yet general enough to feel like they are oh my god soooo accurate. Her writers, which include such talented people as Sia Furler and Vampire Weekend's Rostam Batmanglij, make propulsive rhythms and drum fills out of her winsome words. The Furler co-written ""Making the Most of the Night"" builds its chorus off the sound of the words, not their meaning (""Knowyouhadda rough time / but here I come to HIGHjack you / HIGHjack you"") — but its insistent, playful seduction still comes through in the production. The verses of ""Run Away With Me"" and the chorus of ""I Really Like You"" are such perfect matches of lyrics to melody that the former are almost rendered abstract. You don't read these songs like a book, you drum them out on your steering wheel.    Pop music is made to be shared. A massive hit single is a common experience in itself, but it often succeeds because it speaks to an existing common experience: big, eternal human struggles like love, loneliness, and of course, Getting Ready to Go Out. It seems deeply counterintuitive then, that increasingly a pop star needs to ride in on a fully formed personal narrative in order for her songs to be successful. But pop music is about patterns and familiarity, both in the form of chorus refrains and familiar faces and characters. There's nothing disingenuous about E•MO•TION; at the same time, Jepsen doesn't give any of herself in it. Jepsen isn't selling her story as a product, and thus E•MO•TION remains perfectly executed, thoroughly unscalable pop.",0.6045979104921249,0.39540208950787514,0.19168559828781873,1102,4.8502722323049001,579,6.1312607944732296,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Music"

Amazon is pulling in Emmy nods for shows like Transparent and attracting established talent like Bryan Cranston; Hulu is cornering the market on Seinfeld syndication and making shows of their own; Netflix is churning out so much programming that it's expanding by focusing on mediocrity. At this point, it feels like a new series order or premiere date is announced every other day. With that in mind, it's worth taking a step back and evaluating just how active Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon have become in their few years as purveyors of original content. And in the spirit of Hack Week, what better way to compare these three giants than with a fancy, filterable chart? A note regarding the methodology behind this chart: I counted each discrete season of a show as one entry in a given year. For example, Orange Is the New Black added one to Netflix's total in the 2013, 2014, 2015, and TBA categories (because it's been renewed for a fourth season). I also counted every pilot Amazon included in a given batch of new shows in the count, even if the pilot wasn't picked up for a full series order. The shows are separated by genre so we can see where the services are placing their biggest bets — for example, Amazon has concentrated the bulk of its efforts to date on comedies and kids' shows. Netflix is dominating this sphere I could've made a few decisions differently in tabulating the data, and it wouldn't have mattered — Netflix is dominating this sphere. It's responsible for over 70 percent of the items counted, though that percentage is artificially inflated by the huge number of confirmed renewals and movie deals in its back pocket. (If you only count comedies and dramas, their share jumps down to 55 percent — still a majority, but not quite as staggering.) The service is set up well for continued dominance, too: it has more TBA shows than Amazon and Hulu combined. Of course, these numbers are subject to rapid and staggering change. Amazon could announce a new batch of pilots and a few movie deals tomorrow. That volatility is a major reason why the TV landscape is so exciting right now. The chart also ignores the existence of both network and cable television, and companies in both categories are making their own moves into streaming content. (The inclusion of HBO alone would've completely transformed the data below.) But it makes for an interesting snapshot of the companies at the vanguard of streaming original content, a group with one obvious leader.

Today, it went a step further and introduced an actual upcoming product: a Kinect-style 3D camera built for game streaming and virtual reality. The apparently unnamed device is based on RealSense, Intel's depth-sensing camera technology. You can already find RealSense processing in laptops, and it can be used for, among other things, drone navigation. But Razer's camera is specifically geared at common gaming applications. For people who stream on platforms like Twitch, its sensors can trace around their face and replace the background, like an automatic green screen. This is already a standard feature in RealSense, and there's no shortage of other background replacement options, but RealSense is still relatively uncommon in computers, and it could require less work and be more reliable than DIY setups. More speculatively, Razer sees this as a step towards VR gaming. The RealSense camera could become an external tracker for VR headsets, scan real-world objects to put them into a game, or track hand motion, among other things. Motion sensing is also an established, if niche, technology — Oculus has acquired several hand-tracking companies, the Kinect is a semi-viable control option, and Leap Motion announced its own faceplate for Razer's OSVR headset development kit. Without knowing more details, the distinguishing factor here is the Razer brand name, the dual focus on video and 3D mapping, and the (quite plausible) possibility that it's part of a larger Razer VR line. There's no word on pricing or release date beyond ""coming soon,"" and the image above is a concept rendering that could change in the future.

We're totally blowing up our site: we've given our reporters and editors the entire week to play with new tools and experiment with new storytelling ideas, while members of our amazing product team have gathered in New York to help build all sorts of interesting new things. Learn more. Big-budget games are a paradoxical combination of incredibly conservative business strategies and incredibly fast-moving technology. Few other industries love franchises so much, and few other mediums change so quickly. The result is single stories that span decades, each entry shaped by both the culture it was made in and the machines that it was played on. Next year, we're going to see one of the weirder byproducts of this system: Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, a story connecting the future of the present with the past of the future of the past. Deus Ex is the kind of conceptually fascinating series that's best when it feels dated. It's a set of four (soon, five) games based around contemporary conspiracy theories, from FEMA camps to chupacabras. The first game, despite being set around 2050, presented a very 1990s near-future; director Warren Spector described it as a cross between James Bond and The X-Files. But in 2011, it was pulled all the way back to the late 2020s for prequel Human Revolution — requiring developers to extrapolate forwards from reality and backwards from what is now the retro-future. Deus Ex extrapolates forwards from the present and backwards from the retro-future The original 2000 game features some normal predictive failures; news websites and ebooks, for example, haven't overtaken newspapers and hardcover novels. But the biggest issue is that modern technology and game conventions have left Deus Ex's 2050s in the dust. The game's nano-augmented protagonist is supposedly replacing Human Revolution's cyborgs, but in 2011, it's possible to animate far more over-the-top superpowers. First-person shooter characters have gotten more powerful. An average protagonist can constantly regenerate health and take down enemies by pressing a button. And little futuristic details in clothing and furniture can actually come through, instead of being lost in a low-resolution texture. In 10 years, we'll have Renaissance collars and diamond-textured slacks; in 30, we're back to plain leather couches and power suits.  But this gap hasn't broken the story, it's shaped it in a way that few other mediums could manage. If Deus Ex had been produced as a movie, it would be almost impossible to buy the premise that Human Revolution's writers came up with: that humanity reached a technological apex, then regressed to a world clearly filmed in the 1990s. But the beauty of the original game's rough design is that nothing has ever looked like it. Fashions are torn up and put back together with muddy textures and scant polygons. You feel an intense desolation in the world's flat, repeating textures. If you stop thinking of everything as a crude ancestor of modern gaming, it's not just futuristic, it's totally alien. Here, for example, is Deus Ex's conception of a UNATCO (future UN) peacekeeper, compared to a Detroit cop from Human Revolution:  Everything exists at an almost symbolic level: you're in a shantytown composed of three or four shacks, a rat sliding awkwardly across a couple of strategically placed pieces of garbage. There's an empty barrel with the vague suggestion of fire. Why did the peacekeeper have to kill that terrorist with a Bowie knife? Because even the all-powerful world government's armories are feeling the pinch of recession, obviously. The maps, meanwhile, are massive. They're built to an entirely different scale, with vast amounts of space and nothing to fill it. An office hallway in Deus Ex looks like a cathedral:    Warren Spector has said that everything in Deus Ex was modeled on a real place in some way, which feels right — I explored Battery Park there years before I moved to New York. But it's warped by the limits on textures and decals, as well as the fact that older first-person shooter protagonists covered ground much more quickly than their modern counterparts. And forget about crowds. Even for a neighborhood under lockdown, Hell's Kitchen is a wasteland compared to 2020s Detroit. Nobody even has the lights on.  The game's architectural decisions raise questions of their own. When did New York real estate value drop so far that bathrooms became the size of studio apartments?  You get the feeling that everyone is living in the ruins of a greater culture, where all available objects must be arranged at careful intervals, never touching, to disguise the fact.  While we've long recognized pixel graphics as a distinctive style, 3D models are often still judged by the benchmarks of strict realism and technological progress. The indie world is coming around to low-poly design as an artistic choice, with games like Neon Struct and the work of Brendon Chung. But like most AAA shooters, Deus Ex is devoted to pushing the boundaries of computer graphics. The game world might regress, but technology marches on. This means that starting with Mankind Divided — which takes place between the prequel and the original game — we'll get closer and closer to a photorealistic version of a place that was defined by its eerie unreality. We've got a weird few decades ahead of us. But at least, contrary to the sum of my lived experience, there will always be room at the bar.

You get more screen and more customizable buttons, and the brutal truth is that a well-done virtual keyboard will let you type faster and more accurately than you can with even the best physical keyboard. It's better. But even so, in losing all those tiny buttons we lost something else: the ability to just start typing on our phones and have something magical happen. Sure, you can swipe or tap to bring up a search — but more often than not you won't bother. It's just easier, or at least more habitual, to hunt down the app you want and use its interface. The ""just type"" mentality won't die But that ""just type"" mentality won't die among power users — and I'm one of them. I use Alfred on my Mac to connect up all sorts of services so I can just type in what I want done and watch it magically happen. I also am a big fan of Fantastical, which lets you just punch out your appointment in natural language and let the calendar app figure out where, when, and with whom I have an appointment. Input is free if you only hook up two services, and it costs $1.99 for every three you to add on top of that.   And on the iPhone, I've been trying out a new app called Input. The idea is simple: instead of icons, you get a command prompt. You plug in the apps that you use and then you're able to shoot commands to them from a single interface, just by typing. I've plugged ToDoist, Evernote, and Calendar into Input, and now I can just type what I need done (or, more accurately, what I need to get done) and those apps will magically create the relevant entries. Does the command line really make sense on a smartphone? But the question is whether this command line model really makes sense on a smartphone — especially one that has both Siri and Google Now available on it. Both of those virtual assistants promise similar functionality — but they're both locked down to their respective ecosystems (though Google, I have to admit, is slightly better at integrating other apps for some features). So Input's reason for being is that it's able to talk to the services that you're actually using, the ones that your digital assistant obstinately refuses to call: Evernote, Wunderlist, Asana, Slack, Venmo, Twitter, and a few more. The list of supported apps isn't as long as I'd like, but it hits enough of the ones that I use that I could see myself going to Input when I don't want the cognitive overhead of hunting down an app when I just need to rattle off something quick. Input works for me mainly because I use a bunch of those apps instead of living just inside Apple Land or Google Land. It's a great idea, but it also has me wishing I could make it a core part of the interface, the way that Siri is. And in fact, what it really does is make me realize how much I wish that Siri and Google Now were more extensible. I need an assistant that can talk to all of those services and — most importantly — treat them as equals. Input does that, but it doesn't do all of the other magical things that Siri and Google Now do. What I want is one thing that does all of those things, built deeply into an operating system. Why can't Siri or Google Now do this? Just before it went up in smoke, Palm created an extensible, universal search service called ""Just type"" that let any developer plug any app into it with simple commands. And BlackBerry 10 has a similar feature — though of course it's not supported by many developers. Apparently what I want isn't really a priority, given the fates of both of those companies. I suppose investing in a command line interface doesn't make sense without a persistent, physical keyboard. Voice makes much more sense for these quick actions. Sadly, it also makes sense that Siri and Google Now aren't as friendly to all apps as I'd like them to be — a cold, hard, ecosystem lock-in kind of sense. It takes all of two minutes to get Alfred to talk to my preferred Tasks app on the Mac and all of 30 seconds to get Input to do same thing on my iPhone. Somehow, I don't think it would be that hard for Apple and Google to build these kinds of choices into their assistants. Until they do, I'll be keeping Input on my home screen.",0.510230837221441,0.489769162778559,0.17369273293932452,808,4.3551980198019802,390,5.476923076923077,0,2,"Apps, Tech"

Amazon could also be exploring other ways to make the $50 target price possible.

It's not that easy, right? As someone who was around for the arrival of the World Wide Web, even I have trouble remembering what was around in those early days. Google didn't start until 1997. Angelfire and Craigslist launched in 1996.  Others, like Pets.com, didn't make it. But 20 years ago this week, in an office at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, gamma ray astronomers Robert Nemiroff and Jerry Bonnell created a simple website that still thrives today: the Astronomy Picture of the Day, or APOD.   APOD serves its titular purpose with minimal flare. Every day — the site updates at 12AM ET — there's one featured image (or video) of our cosmos. That's accompanied by a short description with some links for anyone who wants to dig a little deeper. The site is available in 20 languages, has a Twitter account with a million followers, a Google+ page — don't scoff, the astrophotography community actually thrives there — with over 900,000 fans, and nearly 200,000 likes on Facebook. There's an Instagram account, countless apps, and there's even a dedicated subreddit. All that helps account for more than 1 million visits to the APOD website each day – a far cry from the first day 20 years ago when it barely cracked a dozen. APOD launched on June 16, 1995. In advance of its milestone birthday, I spoke on the phone with the two guys who have run the site by hand for two decades, a seemingly unfathomable task in the age of ephemeral content. How do they do it? A combination of Microsoft Word, a fiery passion for astrophotography, and lots and lots of emails. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. So where did the idea originally come from? Robert Nemiroff: Jerry Bonnell and I shared an office at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and we were both — we’re still — active researchers. But the web was growing up, and so we brainstormed to try to figure out how we could contribute to this web. One idea, we thought, was maybe we can make lots of money, and buy a Hawaiian island or something. But that never worked out. [Laughs.] So we were getting these emails that had these image attachments, sometimes about the Hubble Space Telescope, sometimes from something else, and the people sending these emails had no idea what that was. It would say, ""Look at this, it’s colorful and something astronomical. Isn’t that cool?"" So we thought maybe something we could do was take these images and explain them one after the next. Jerry Bonnell: When Bob and I started doing APOD we were both gamma ray astronomers. We were working in an energy regime that’s way beyond visual wavelengths [of light]. So we have a very broad concept of what an ""image"" might be, and I think we’ve translated that to some degree into APOD. I’m still impressed at the imaging we can do beyond the visual spectrum. I’m always on the lookout for a picture that you could never see with your eyes. Under the hood, how does APOD work? Robert Nemiroff: I just open up Microsoft Word on my PC. I bring up the text file from an old APOD post from a couple of days ago. I delete out the old stuff, I put the new stuff in, then I transfer it to [the network at] NASA Goddard and I look it over, and with the VI editor I make changes, because I almost always make some kind of mistake somewhere. And then I look at the result and see if it looks reasonable, and if so then I just leave it alone.  On the left, the first ever APOD post. On the right, a recent one from June of 2015. The design of the site really hasn't changed much at all. It reminds me of Craigslist; it serves a purpose so well that it doesn't need to look any different. Robert Nemiroff: Maybe a couple times a year we get emails from somebody who says, ""I’m a web designer, your page is out of date. Don’t worry, I’ll do it for free!"" And so far we’ve declined all those requests, because it’s functional. We’re translated into 20 different languages, and there’s also apps and things like that that read our files. If we were to change our structure it would cause a domino effect down the line. It’s just simple. There’s one image, and that’s the image of the day. It’s pretty much been the same since 1995. You might notice the 1995 ones the picture’s not centered, because there was no center tag. So we did upgrade to the center tag. But we haven’t done much else. Jerry Bonnell: Boy that was a breakthrough for me in HTML coding, when I learned how to center something. The design has evolved very little. I like the idea that it’s very simple, it’s still very bytes-small. What kind of routine do you maintain to update the site daily? Robert Nemiroff: I usually do the beginnings of the weeks and Jerry does the ends of the weeks, and Wednesday can go either way. I will do several in a row. I’ll do most of my week maybe on Thursday or Friday, sometimes on Saturday or Sunday. Sometimes I’ll leave Wednesday to the night before in case there’s some kind of breaking news. Jerry will do the ends of the weeks, he usually waits until the night before, and works on it during the afternoon. Both Jerry and I, we surf the web all the time anyway incessantly, we can’t stop it. If APOD was to die tomorrow we would still be surfing the web and saying, ""Oh, that’s a cool astronomy image."" So I’ve accumulated some that I’ve seen, many were submitted. People submit a lot of images. Jerry Bonnell: I get ideas at all times, and I try to pay attention to things coming in and what’s going on in astronomy. Ideas tend to present themselves. I would say it’s unusual to have things queued up a week in advance. We usually run only a few days in advance. But that’s one of the things that I’ve enjoyed and still enjoy about APOD over the years. Robert Nemiroff: If, however, there’s a very topical image that comes out, then it’s understood that either of us will stop what we’re doing and work until they’ve created an APOD post based on that image, move it over to NASA Goddard, and then it will be in the queue for the ""robot"" to update at midnight Eastern time. Do you have a favorite type of image that you look forward to seeing on the site? Robert Nemiroff: I just like the stuff where you look at it and say ""Wow, what’s that!"" I’m somewhat jaded after 20 years. It has to work for me before I try to make it work for other people.   Jerry Bonnell: I seem to be a sucker for the big, beautiful spiral galaxy images. How does the process of searching for the right image compare to 20 years ago?   Jerry Bonnell: We used to use the pretty pictures that came from observatories and NASA, stuff like that, for the picture of the day. But now I think it’s much more heavily weighted toward the amateur communities and non-institutional imaging. We get tons of images submitted, so now I have to spend much of my day looking through my email, whereas it didn’t used to be that way. I used to have to be more proactive. I would explore what was online and available in the NASA archives online, and I would also make occasional trips to photo libraries that I could find at Goddard and NASA headquarters and look at the prints.     How closely tied is that rise in submissions related to the amateur astrophotography boom?  Jerry Bonnell: It’s really been driven by the rise of CCD [sensor] technology. You used to have to have institutional budgets to afford those, now you can just buy these things off the shelf. It’s become more of a garage-level kind of technology. It makes the application of it a lot more creative by the amateur community. They can think of their own ideas, they can devote their own time. They don’t have to apply for observing time at a telescope. That, and the fact that we have very powerful computers sitting on the desktop or being carried around in people’s pockets. Robert Nemiroff: Amateur astrophotographers have gotten much better, and they’re just doing amazing stuff. Easily the ones we’re rejecting today, if we had seen those in 1997 we would've said, ""This is great, we’re going to put this up!"" But things that in 1997 would have been wonderful, we just have better images now. Really good amateur astrophotographers, they’re always taking great images and always outdoing themselves. They have more time to look deeper with more detail. Cell phones are capturing things like meteors that wouldn’t have been found before, and we're getting dash cam images of meteors coming in through the atmosphere. Technology is providing much better images than before, some unexpected images. I can't imagine you running out of images to post now, but was there ever a time in the early days where you thought you might not be able to keep this up?  Jerry Bonnell: In the early days we were criticized by our colleagues for this idea, you know — how could we come up with an image a day? I think Bob and I both had the thought that we could certainly come up with an image a day, but we were in danger of maybe becoming the ""lunar orbiter"" image of the day website. That was what was really accessible. Robert Nemiroff: Before we posted our first image we debated this, Jerry and I, as to whether we were going to run out of images in a few days and then say, ""Well that was stupid."" But actually there were many images around even back then. And NASA’s Ranger series took tens of thousands of images of the lunar surface, so if we had to we could just start putting up other pictures of the lunar surface. ""Here’s another crater that’s a little bit different than yesterday’s crater."" But we never ran out of images. We always had interesting images, and as time went on we were sent more and more images. And now we reject 10 to 1, so for every image you see we’ve rejected 10.        Robert Nemiroff (left) and Jerry Bonnell (right) at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in 2007 You've built a really simple site that seems like it can last forever, and you're definitely not going to run out of images any time soon. Where does APOD go from here?  Robert Nemiroff: I’d like to think that APOD is more of an idea than just a website. I would hope that the concept would live on past Jerry and me, and that when images come out that are astronomy-based and the talk of the day, that becomes the ""astronomy picture of the day"" and is posted somewhere with at least a minimal explanation so people who are not necessarily part of the astronomy crowd or space enthusiasts can understand what’s going on. I hope it goes many years, and we’re considered to be just the first people to do this. Websites come and go. I remember when the greatest search engine I ever saw came on called Altavista. I told Jerry, ""This is the best one! I don’t know why there would ever be a better search engine than Altavista. This is going to live forever."" Now I don’t know if it’s even still there. We feel lucky. We’re going to make it to 20, anything else is icing on the cake. Jerry Bonnell: I don’t think I’ve ever contemplated the endgame. I’m not feeling particularly mortal right now.

The increase wasn't universal, though — the teen birth rate dropped by 9 percent, a record low. Births among women in their 30s increased by 3 percent There are probably many reasons for this change, but an increase in contraceptive use most certainly played a role. More women are using condoms and the Pill than they were 20 years ago, and IUDs are gaining in popularity because of their ease of use. In fact, if you ask the CDC about it, the answer is pretty clear: the best contraceptives for teens are IUDs and implants — and it looks like their use is paying off. Teen births decreased by more than 60 percent in a quarter century The most recent peak in teen births occurred in 1991. Back then, there were close to 62 births for every 1,000 women aged 15 to 19. Today, the rate is 24 births per 1,000 women, which means that teen births have decreased by more than 60 percent in a quarter century. It's a slow change, but it's still very good news; children born to teenage parents are more likely to be born prematurely, and they're more likely to suffer from poor health early in life. That wasn't the only large drop in 2014, however. The US also saw a 2 percent drop among women in their 20s.

Here's hoping they work on your computer While we've seen some 4K videos from the ISS in the past (like this gorgeous one from the ESA, or this one posted to ReelNASA earlier this week), they have typically been time lapses made from large batches of still photos, which required lots of time and editing. NASA figuring out a way to download near-real-time UHD video means the 4K content could make it to the internet much faster. Of course, many computers still struggle to support 4K video, let alone the ones running at 60fps. Now excuse me while I try to get NASA in touch with Lucasfilm's new VR team.

By analyzing historical storm data, researchers have found that the likelihood of a coastal city experiencing severe rainfall and storm surge at the same time is far greater nowadays than it was in the middle of the 20th century. And that combination has substantially amplified the risk of flooding in coastal counties over the course of the past century — counties that house about 40 percent of the US population. The average flood claim is almost $42,000 Floods are one of the most common natural disasters in the US. They don't claim as many lives as heat and hurricanes, but they cause a ton of damage. Between 2010 and 2014, the average flood claim was almost $42,000. And that doesn't even take into account the number of people that are displaced following a severe flooding event. That's why researchers are trying to figure out which factors contribute to flooding; it's the kind of information that can really come in handy when rebuilding a city, for instance. In the study, researchers used records of rainfall, sea level, and hurricanes to assess the relationship between heavy precipitation on land and the abnormal rise of water that occurs during a storm, a phenomenon that's referred to as a ""storm surge."" They found that, for both US coasts, the kind of weather event that blows water toward the coast — thus causing a storm surge — is now more likely to also cause heavy rainfall over land, compared with weather events that took place in the middle of 20th century.   (Theodore Scontras / University of Maine) The scientists also found that storm surges and heavy rain occur more often along East Coast compared with the West — largely because of the tropical cyclones and hurricanes that occur in the East. As a result, the chance that New York City will experience a weather scenario that combines simultaneous storm surge and heavy rain has actually doubled, compared with 60 years ago. Storm surges and heavy rainfall are happening together more often  The study ""clearly identifies"" an increasing connection between storm surges and heavy rain, says Carling Hay, a geophysicist at Harvard University who didn't work on the study — and that's pretty novel. ""It's well known that the combination of storm surges and heavy precipitation has the potential to increase coastal flooding; however, I'm not aware of other studies that have examined long term trends in the co-occurrence of the two."" The researchers don't know if climate change contributes to this altered relationship, says Thomas Wahl, an oceanographer at the University of South Florida and a co-author of the study. That's a question that they plan to tackle next. That said, researchers already have evidence that global warming has led to heavier rainfall in some places, and many think that warming will lead to more heavy rain events globally, says Philip Orton, a physical oceanographer at the Stevens Institute of Technology who didn't work on the study. In addition, researchers have shown that sea level rise causes more coastal floods — and this will intensify as sea level rise accelerates. ""Whether this pair of troublemakers will become closer allies in the future is harder to predict,"" Orton says. ""But this paper is one of the first ever to look at the problem over such a broad area, so it's a step in the right direction for better understanding the science, and monitoring how things change.""

Though they have a few star-like qualities, these celestial bodies lack some of the fundamental characteristics that define a star; they’re cool, small, and emit very little light. This has led some scientists to argue that brown dwarfs are more akin to planets than they are to the luminous balls of plasma scattered throughout the Universe.  Now, a new study is strengthening the ""planet"" argument. For the first time, astronomers have detected powerful aurorae on a brown dwarf star located 20 light years from Earth. In a study published today in Nature, the researchers detail how they used a radio and an optical telescope to observe the aurorae, like Earth’s Aurora Borealis but much stronger, at the brown dwarf's magnetic poles. Since aurorae have only ever been observed on planets, this discovery points to the idea that brown dwarfs are more like giant planets than they are like stars. ""Is a brown dwarf more like a planet or more like a star?"" Brown dwarfs emit light like other stars do, but that’s where their similarities end. The light they illuminate is so dim, it can only be observed in the infrared. Brown dwarfs are also relatively cool compared to other types of stars — ranging from 1,880 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature of a home oven. Yet what really confuses astronomers is how small these stars are — landing somewhere between 15 and 75 times the mass of Jupiter. That may seem big compared to our puny planet, but study author Gregg Hallinan says it's fairly tiny in the intergalactic scheme of things. ""What defines a star is if it's big enough to fuse hydrogen at its core,"" Hallinan, a professor of astronomy at the California Institute of Technology, tells The Verge. ""Brown dwarves don’t quite have enough mass to burn hydrogen throughout their lifetime; they’re liked failed stars. So the question you might ask: is a brown dwarf more like a planet or more like a star?"" One way scientists have gone about answering this question is by studying the magnetic activity of brown dwarfs; magnetic fields manifest differently when surrounding a star versus a planet. Our Sun's magnetic field, for example, helps to heat up the star's outer atmosphere to a very high temperature, causing activity like sun spots, solar flares, and solar wind. Earth's magnetic field, however, acts something like a shield from this solar activity. When the charged particles of solar wind hit Earth's field, they get redirected to our planet's magnetic poles, where they get excited and emit the greens and blues of the aurora.   Jupiter has its own powerful aurora. (NASA, ESA) All planets that have magnetic fields within our Solar System have aurorae, so Hallinan and other researchers believed that if brown dwarfs were more like planets, they too would exhibit aurorae. To figure this out, Hallinan and his research team analyzed one brown dwarf in particular — LSRJ 1835+3259. Previously, Hallinan discovered that this dwarf pulses, sending out a blast of radio waves every few hours. That kind of activity is unlike anything ever observed from a large star, but similar pulsing has been seen from Jupiter. When Jupiter rotates every 10 hours, it blasts radio waves — and produces an aurora at the same time. They theorized the same thing was happening on this brown dwarf. The researchers used the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array to observe LSRJ 1835+3259's radio emissions, along with the Palomar's Hale Telescope and the W. M. Keck Observatory's telescopes to gather optical data about the brown dwarf. Sure enough, each time LSRJ 1835+3259 rotated — every 2.84 hours — it pulsed a radio emission and an aurora appeared at a location on the brown dwarf's surface. ""The aurora is so much more powerful than anything we've seen in our Solar System."" ""In the case of the brown dwarf, the aurora is so much more powerful than anything we've seen in our Solar System,"" says Hallinan. ""Jupiter's aurorae are 1,000 times more powerful than the Earth's aurorae. Well this brown dwarf has aurorae that are at least 10,000 times more powerful than Jupiter's aurora."" The aurorae's colors are also a bit more diverse, emitting red along with blue and green. As for what is powering these aurorae, it could be the combination of the dwarf's rapid rotation, as well as an active planet that's orbiting the brown dwarf, spewing charged particles into the object's magnetic field. ""There's a possibility there’s something like an Io there,"" says Jonathan Nichols, an advanced fellow in planetary auroras at the University of Leiceste, who was not involved in the study. ""Io is this very active, volcanic moon that's deeps inside Jupiter’s magnetic field. It's the planet's rapid rotation combined with this volcanic nature of Io that gives rise to Jupiter’s radio emissions and aurorae."" Overall, Nichols says the research is exciting because it strengthens the argument that brown dwarfs are more closely related to planets, kind of like ""beefed-up Jupiters."" ""Typically, people tend to think of these things as failed stars,"" says Nichols. ""My preferred explanation is they’re more like very successful planets, and this study demonstrates more planet behavior than stellar behavior.""",0.34913021705063585,0.6508697829493642,0.36143826759356085,889,5.0517435320584925,447,6.0469798657718119,0,2,"Science, Report"

They created a ribosome, the factory for proteins within the cell, inside a living cell, where it worked just like its natural counterpart, according to a report in the journal Nature. This finding means it may soon be possible to harness these little machines to produce more complex proteins, perhaps — one day — for use in medicine. But the scientists did something even more remarkable: they changed the structure of the protein factories themselves. In nature, ribosomes are split in halves, which float around separately inside the cell until it’s time to produce a protein. To keep the lab-made ribosome from linking up with the naturally occurring ones — which would kill the cell — the scientists tethered the two halves together. Keys to the protein-making factory  This change in ribosome structure may have accounted for the attempt’s success — scientists have tried to produce them in the past. They’re crucial structures in the cell; if DNA is a blueprint, the ribosomes are the carpenters. Making one from scratch might give researchers the ability to make any number of proteins easily, and in large quantities. But until now, no one has been able to make a whole ribosome within a living cell. ""A lot of people consider the ribosome to be the chef of translation and so one of the things we’re curious to know now is if you have the ability to make specialized chefs, chefs that make different types of cuisines,"" says Michael Jewett, synthetic biologist at Northwestern University and a co-author of the study. These ribosomes could be tailored to only make a certain type of molecule, one that a ribosome has never made before — or one that can be used to mass produce a new drug. This ""sets the stage for the production of entirely new classes of exotic [molecules]."" ""Overall, the authors have surmounted a major barrier in constructing fully synthetic and customizable ribosomes,"" and in doing so, ""they've laid the foundation for dramatic alterations of the ribosome not previously seen,"" says Karissa Sanbonmatsu, a ribosome researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory who didn’t work on the study. Farren Isaacs, a cellular biologist at Yale University, agrees. The study is ""a key advance,"" that ""sets the stage for the production of entirely new classes of exotic [molecules]."" Despite this high praise, the final design remains flawed. Cells that only have the artificial ribosome, called Ribo-T, grow two times slower than cells with normal ribosomes, says Alexander Mankin, a molecular biologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a co-author of the study. ""Our tethered ribosome is good, but not as good as ‘normal’ ribosome"" — at least ""not yet."" After all, normal ribosomes are the product of several billion years of evolution, ""and our Ribo-T is only one year old!"" Mankin says. ""Our Ribo-T is only one year old!""  But the point of engineering a protein factory isn’t to improve the naturally occurring version, anyway. If Ribo-T falls short when making regular cellular proteins, but can still be repurposed to make a specific therapeutic protein, ""we would be very happy,"" Mankin says. No one seems to know what the next steps are. ""How do you imagine producing new types of materials as evolvable, living matter? What does that look like? We don’t know,"" Jewett says.

In the image we see what New Horizons' principal investigator Alan Stern calls the ""icy, frozen plains"" of Pluto.  It is made from three images that were taken by the LORRI imager on the New Horizons spacecraft at 6:10AM ET on July 14th, shortly before the spacecraft's closest approach. For scale, each pixel represents 0.4km on the surface.  One of the three frames in the mosaic shows a complex, frozen section of Pluto's surface that New Horizons geologist Jeff Moore jokingly called ""not-easy-to-explain terrain"" during a press conference. NASA is informally calling the region “Sputnik Planum” in honor of the first satellite to orbit the Earth. Sputnik Planum has an irregular, segmented surface separated by troughs, a pattern that's reminiscent of how mud dries on Earth.  In a zoomed-in view, Moore detailed what appears to be evidence of wind streaks on the surface. The dark streaks point in the same direction and stretch for miles. The icy surface also shows evidence of sublimation, a process where ice turns directly into gas. New Horizons scientists believe there may also be icy plumes on Pluto, perhaps from cyrovolcanoes, but there is still no visible evidence.   Another one of the frames in the mosaic was released at a press conference earlier this week. That lone image gave New Horizons team scientists a lot of new information about the dwarf planet. We now know Pluto has mountains made of water-ice that stretch as high as 11,000 feet, and that the surface is very young, which we know thanks to the telltale lack of visible impact craters. These results are puzzling because, until this week, it was thought that icy bodies like Pluto were poorly equipped for geological activity. These types of worlds typically need a large source of gravity nearby (like Europa has with Jupiter) to provide the kind of tidal forces that can create surface features like the ones seen in these images. The New Horizons team will now focus some of its science efforts on figuring out why Pluto behaves this way. Last week, Pluto was little more than a blurry speck in the sky. Now we're scouring it for the smallest details. But New Horizons team members are quick to remind everyone that there's more to come. The reconnaissance of Pluto is only going to expand, and the scientific analysis is going to get better. NASA has a few more landmark image releases planned in the coming days. The rest of the data from the spacecraft's flyby of Pluto will be unpacked, analyzed, and published over the next 16 months. Zoom in!

The new image is zoomed into less than one percent of Pluto's surface. It was published less than 24 hours after NASA received confirmation that the New Horizons spacecraft successfully completed its flyby of Pluto. More of these scans will be released on Friday. The high-resolution image of Pluto's surface shows us a fraction of the lower left portion of yesterday's image. John Spencer, a New Horizons science team member, said that the team has yet to find an impact crater in any of the scans, which means the surface of Pluto is very young relative to the rest of the solar system. Spencer also said that the mountains seen in the image stretch to over 11,000 feet (about 3,350 meters) high, and are likely made of a type of water-ice bedrock.   See Pluto in high-resolution The mountains probably formed less than 100 million years ago, according to NASA. They might also still be growing. That's counterintuitive to the way we've previously viewed icy worlds, which are typically only geologically active if they're orbiting much larger bodies. (Take Saturn's moon Titan, for example, which has visibly active cryovolcanoes that are aided by Saturn's massive gravitational pull.) While there are no immediate signs of cryovolcanoes, the New Horizons team will be looking for them when they get more high-resolution scans. They might also be visible in the images taken from the backside of Pluto, when the dwarf planet is back-lit by the Sun. Spencer said that this one image is already making the team rethink how the geological activity on these worlds is powered. Alan Stern, New Horizons' principal investigator, agreed. ""The one thing we can say for sure is that tidal energy is not at play here,"" he said. ""[Now] we have to get a little more clever."" The team also announced that the ""heart"" feature of Pluto will now be known as the Tombaugh Regio, after Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto.

New Horizons gave us our first real look at Pluto and its moons. As Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator, described it to me, ""We turned a point of light into a planet, and we did it like that"" — a declarative statement he accented with an inhumanly loud finger snap. That's catchy, but boiling down the New Horizons mission to 15 words sort of obscures the magnitude of the accomplishment. New Horizons was the fastest object to leave Earth when it escaped our planet's atmosphere at more than 36,000 miles per hour in 2006. Nine years later, it passed Pluto at a distance of just 7,800 miles, threading the needle through a target window less than 100 miles wide. And, somehow, all the science being done by the seven instruments onboard only consumes 28 watts of power.    All this bred a contagious excitement that consumed the people on campus at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, the headquarters for New Horizons. Each day, guests and media cornered scientists in hallways to ask them questions like ""What’s with that whale shape?"" The scientists themselves were so excited that they were positing new theories in the middle of media briefings about fresh data. Even one of the NASA TV camera operators couldn't resist shooting a double thumbs up to the crowd while whispering, ""This is exciting!"" on a quiet set. The flyby has so far been an unmitigated success, and we will hopefully have a long time to revel in it — NASA won't be done downloading all the data from New Horizons until October of 2016. Beyond that, the mission's future is unclear. The team wants to go to another object in the Kuiper belt, but a mission extension requires funding. I asked Stern about an equally difficult task: sustaining the public excitement that was stirred up over the last month. ""Most people lead busy lives,"" he said. ""They’ll sort of check a box: 'Pluto’s been explored, it’s really complicated, it looks like a planet to me.' But, you know, our goal this week was to show how exploration rocks, how exciting it can be."" Mission accomplished. NASA held the Pluto flyby event at the headquarters for New Horizons — the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. Scale models of New Horizons could be found around every corner of the campus. Alan Stern, the principal investigator for New Horizons, speaks to the crowd at Johns Hopkins moments before New Horizons performed its flyby. It would take more than 12 hours before the world knew whether the spacecraft was still alive. That didn't stop the crowd from celebrating. New Horizons team members, NASA staff, and guests filled multiple rooms to watch the countdown. The crowd cheers as the countdown reached zero. A remix of Europe's ""The Final Countdown"" was playing in the speakers. Guests and members of the media watch Bill Nye's reaction to the now-famous image of Pluto, which NASA released just before the flyby occurred.  Journalists pore over Pluto's details while they waited for the post-flyby briefing to begin. Various New Horizons team members met with the media all week to offer insight and discuss the latest mission developments. It will take 16 months to completely download the data from the spacecraft. “We are facing the Christmas that keeps on giving,"" said Kimberly Ennico Smith, a New Horizons deputy project scientist. Chris Hersman, lead engineer of New Horizons, explains the spacecraft's trajectory with a mockup made from an iPhone 4, a pen, and a sliced up Dunkin Donuts cup.   Pluto's ""heart"" is not healthy, according to team scientist Bonnie Buratti. The bright region has been eroding for years to the extent that it was even visible before New Horizons showed it in detail. Sylvia Kuiper (left), daughter of Gerard Kuiper (for whom the Kuiper belt is named), holds up an image of Pluto alongside Alden and Annette Tombaugh, whose father discovered Pluto. John Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science, holds up the now-famous image of Pluto. Grunsfeld and Stern watch a New Horizons media briefing. Members of the media listen to Ellen Stofan, NASA's chief scientist, speak about New Horizons and the agency's future plans. A geologist by trade, she said she was fascinated by the increasing detail of the images, and that it was tough to resist drawing early conclusions about the makeup of Pluto and Charon. ""I was looking on Twitter, so it's really hard to look at a Twitter photograph and start doing geology on it — but of course I was doing it anyway,"" she said. Team scientist Bill McKinnon explains some of Pluto's features to the media. McKinnon wore socks on flyby day that showed the phases of our Moon. New Horizons has enough fuel to last until the 2030s but would require a major mission extension to still be doing science that far from now. Team scientist Fran Bagenal was asked if the spacecraft will ever get to study the boundaries of our Solar System. ""We'll measure as long as we can,"" she replied, ""and as long as we have money."" Tom Krimigis takes questions from the audience during a briefing. He has been a part of major space missions to each of the nine major planetary bodies in the Solar System.   Ann Druyan, one of the co-writers of COSMOS and Carl Sagan's widow, spoke at a panel on the day before the flyby. ""I just briefly wanted to celebrate the fact that this continuity of minds that is science, that stretches back to antiquity, is the most precious thing we have. And if it is good enough to get us to the Kuiper belt in perfect synchronized, melodic grace — to do this so brilliantly — then it's good enough for us to really depend on it for the saving of our lives. We should be listening to the scientists and what they're telling us about the fate of this world."" Alan Stern (right) holds up an issue of The Planetary Report from 1990 that contains a plan to explore Pluto. Stern wrote the paper, and Robert Farquhar (left) was the study manager. The spacecraft in Stern's plan looks similar to New Horizons. Magician and entertainer David Blaine performs a trick with an audience member.  The audience member was instructed to pick one puzzle piece from a bin. The piece wound up being the only one missing from a separate, nearly complete puzzle of our solar system. The auditorium at the Johns Hopkins Kossiakoff Center was where most of the main media briefings and NASA TV broadcasts were held. This was what the room looked right minutes before the doors were opened before the ""phone home"" event. Volunteers sort the programs, stickers, and other promotional materials available for guests of the event. The New Horizons team members who spoke on stage used these commemorative mugs.  Mission operations manager Alice Bowman (right) receives word that New Horizons has phoned home and that all systems are healthy. Annette Tombaugh, daughter of the man who discovered Pluto, reacts to the news that New Horizons is alive. The New Horizons team enter the auditorium at the Kossiakoff Center to a standing ovation. Alice Bowman greets her team on stage. A New Horizons team member celebrates with the other Pluto.  NASA's administrator Charles Bolden has an emotional moment on the stage shortly before speaking about the successful Pluto flyby. ""Today’s mission was just one more step on the journey of getting humans to Mars, because it gives us one more piece in the puzzle of our Solar System,"" Bolden said. A New Horizons team member is interviewed moments after the news of the successful flyby. The team assembled on stage during Charles Bolden's speech. Alan Stern calls out the rest of the New Horizons team and asks them to stand up to receive recognition. Stern spent much of the week deflecting praise to his team, while his team did a fair share of praising his work. ""You know, we’ve got Alan as the PI on this thing, and thank god for that because if it hand’t been for Alan Stern this mission would not exist,"" said Ralph McNutt, a New Horizons co-investigator. ""It's a big family thing, we've been working together for a long time,"" Stern said. Deputy project scientist Leslie Young celebrates the successful flyby. New Horizons project scientist Hal Weaver (right) and his wife speak to the family of Clyde Tombaugh, the man who discovered Pluto. New Horizons team members pose with wearable versions of the spacecraft, made by Johns Hopkins students. Alice Bowman receives a standing ovation from the audience. Hal Weaver celebrates the news that New Horizons is alive. John Grunsfeld, Alan Stern, and Alice Bowman hold up nine fingers each, known to the New Horizons team as the ""Pluto salute"" — a nod to their belief that Pluto should be recognized as the ninth planet in our Solar System. Alice Bowman receives a hug from NASA administrator Charles Bolden. With the flyby and phone home in the books, the ballroom at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory was finally empty.

Tesla also promises a run to 155 miles per hour some 20 percent faster than on a standard P85D. In follow-up questions, Musk said that the upcoming Model X would also have Ludicrous Speed as an option, but due to the vehicle's weight — it's 10 percent heavier than the S — it'll likely be a bit less quick. Ludicrous Speed doesn't come cheap, though: it's a $10,000 option for the car, so you really need to want to be pressed into the back of your seat.

It's not a way to get a ride, obviously. Instead, it's a way to needle the New York City mayor and to try to get Uber users to pressure him to back off on proposed legislation that could seriously hamper Uber's growth efforts in the city. Uber is dealing with push-back from regulators and taxi companies all around the world, but in New York City it's about to face one of its biggest fights yet. Mayor Bill de Blasio is backing a city council proposal that would temporarily freeze all new licenses for ""for-hire"" vehicles. The freeze would come so that the city could create a study on traffic congestion, which the administration believes is getting worse thanks to ride-sharing. The New York Taxi and Limousine Commission is backing it, saying, ""The onslaught of vehicles is so tremendous that it seems actually irresponsible not to legislate in some way,"" according to The New York Times. Of course, Uber paints the freeze in much more dire terms, arguing that ""10,000 expected new jobs would evaporate"" and that there would be no reduction in congestion if the freeze happens. It's making that argument at a petition site and sending users there directly from the de Blasio ride option in the app. When you select it, the map of available cars in the city is emptied out and the ""wait time"" for a ride rises to 25 minutes. Tap in and you're greeted by a pop-up exhorting you to sign Uber's petition. It's not Uber's first attempt to stop the legislation, as Business Insider reports. Last month it offered free rides to anybody who showed up to a protest it organized. It's also been airing commercials on local television.

(Who isn't?) Today, such a video comes courtesy of McLaren, which has posted three-odd minutes of gratuitous footage of a bright green 675LT doing the absolutely silly things on smooth asphalt that it was designed specifically to do. The 675LT — introduced at Geneva earlier this year — is a hot, limited version of the workaday 650S that gets an extra 25 horsepower, special bodywork, and hardcore suspension tuning while shedding 100 kilograms (about 220 pounds). The ""LT"" in the name is an homage to the legendary F1 GTR Longtail, the rarest (and awesomest) variety of the already ridiculously rare F1 — only 10 were made, and of those, only three were designed for road use.

Unlike other headsets on display this year, however, this interface runs entirely off a smartphone.    For the headset to work, all you need to do is slip a smartphone into the slot and fasten it in place. The display gets reflected onto the one-way visor, letting you see the HUD mapped over your surroundings. Caputer boasts that users will have upwards of a 100-degree field of vision, making for a more immersive experience. Plus, the app can detect your head movements so the interface pans depending on where you're looking. There's even a ""mouse"" cursor that appears in the center, and you can select objects in your path by clenching your jaw. Unfortunately, the Seer is still very much a prototype. The headset I wore was a rough 3D-printed model, and the interface had trouble reading my movements and selections. It's also fairly clear Caputer chose the Iron Man because it sounds cool as opposed to it being immediately intuitive. But why not?

In total, 97 buildings of at least 200 meters in height (656 feet) were completed worldwide in 2014, rising sharply from the previous record of 81 skyscrapers in 2011. Eleven of those buildings are also what the council calls ""supertalls,"" which are at least 300 meters (984 feet) high. Those too are setting a new annual record. One World Trade Center took the title for 2014's tallest building and is now the third tallest in the world.  ""The massive plan to urbanize [China] ... is underway."" The council speculates that the resurgence of skyscrapers is, at least in part, due to economic turnaround. ""Now that six years have passed since the global economic crisis / recession began in 2008, and given the long gestation and construction periods common to tall buildings ... we are almost certainly seeing a post-recessionary recovery,"" the report says. The council also says that China continues to be a major factor, with skyscrapers now appearing in cities that previously had none. This, it says, ""indicat[es] that the massive plan to urbanize the country — requiring the urban relocation of some 250 million people — is underway."" China completed more skyscrapers than any other country this year, accounting for 58 of the 97 buildings. Though this is the seventh year in a row that China has built the most skyscrapers, it's only this year that the country has brought them to some of its biggest cities, like Beijing, which saw two completions in 2014. Asia actually dominated 2014 in general, accounting for 74 of the new completions. The use of skyscrapers is continuing to change, too, though it isn't entirely clear in what direction. The construction of skyscrapers dedicated to office space is increasing, with nearly half of this year's buildings going to that purpose. With 47 office towers, it's the highest total ever, rising up from the previous record of 31 in 2011. Even discounting the increased number of skyscrapers, a full 10 percent more of the total went to office space in 2014 over 2011. That all said, the tallest buildings appear to be finding new purpose. Only 39 of the world's 100 tallest buildings are now office towers.

It all started with Dragon Ball Z. When he was young, Nicolas Delort's friends were watching the anime and collecting the cards, but he fell in love with the black-and-white manga that inspired it all. ""Akira Toriyama's ink work is so clean, precise, and elegant and I spent a lot of time tracing, at first, pages of the manga, and then eyeballing and eventually just doing my own fanart,"" the Paris-based artist explains. That fascination has since turned into a career, as Delort has taken up the classic technique of scratchboard and adopted it for his own incredibly detailed, monochrome creations. The technique involves creating images by literally scratching them onto a piece of clayboard. Delort has used it to illustrate a wide range of images, and not just the dark and gloomy ones you'd associate with black-and-white drawing. His portfolio includes everything from art books based on Blizzard games like Diablo III to magazine covers featuring soccer stars like Clint Dempsey. He's illustrated fantasy book covers and posters of the likes of Charlie Brown and Where the Wild Things Are. ""I have a clear preference for vast compositions where human presence is minimal — ruins, trees, landscapes come much more naturally to me than people,"" he says of his work. ""I'm trying to force myself to experiment a bit more and step out of my comfort zone, but it's sometimes hard to do so on jobs with strict deadlines."" While his work has a classic vibe, like many modern artists, Delort also dabbles in the digital, using tools like Photoshop to get his illustrations from the clayboard to your computer screen. And he doesn't see the two as being in conflict. ""I couldn't do the illustrations I do on a computer, but at the same time I couldn't work as an illustrator without Photoshop,"" he explains. ""They're all just different tools for different goals."" It's early, but 2015 is already filling up with new jobs that will keep Delort pretty busy. That said, he's hoping this will be the year he gets to break away from commissions for a bit, and create something of his own, an illustrated story that explores more personal topics. Then again, there's one commission he'd never say no to. ""I certainly wouldn't mind being asked to illustrate the entire Harry Potter series.""

Set out in a series of detailed renders, the conceptual iMac combines the internal components of an 11.6-inch MacBook Air with the addition of a touchscreen and the new reversible USB connector. Its shape echoes that of the original Mac, though the rear bulk of the computer has sensibly been excised, leaving only a striking aluminum shape. The floppy disk drive of the original has been converted into a speaker grille in the modern version, which also houses an SD card slot, a FaceTime camera, and a microphone.

What was once the domain of RSS is now something handled in large part by social media, be it Facebook’s News Feed, the massive number of links shared on Twitter every day, the ever-popular Flipboard app, or Apple’s recent big push into news on its iOS devices. That’s why LinkedIn is releasing a vastly redesigned version of the Pulse news reader app (out today for iOS and Android) that it purchased back in 2013. Akshay Kothari, co-founder (and now LinkedIn project manager) of Pulse, said that in the first three years, the company made tons of content deals to get as many top publishers as it could on board, and it grew to 30 million users in that time — but that wasn’t enough to thrive as users transitioned to mobile. ""One missing piece of the puzzle was identity,"" Kothari says. ""We didn’t know who our users were, and that was the key thing to start making smart [content] recommendations."" Pulse has refocused around your professional world LinkedIn provided that identity layer — it knows where you work, what industry you’re in, who you follow professionally, and so on. The new Pulse app, which launches today, takes advantage of all that data to present you with a vastly simplified interface compared to the Pulse of old. Rather than different publishers being displayed horizontally, with new stories showing up from left to right, Pulse is now one simple stream of content being pulled from a variety of places. You can still follow publishers (as well as individual LinkedIn authors) if you search for them, but the idea is that you can jump right in and find relevant stories without doing any setup. In addition to showing posts from publishers, the Pulse feed will also show you posts that people in your network share or comment on, stories that mention your company or people you work with, breaking news for industries that are relevant to you, and editorially curated picks by humans who work at LinkedIn. It’s not just all algorithmically generated. ""One of the philosophies we’ve had is the 3 C’s,"" says Kothari. ""We serve high quality content, make sure that we are giving you the right context, and we want to give the user control over what they see.""   To that end, you can swipe left or right on every story you see — swiping to the right saves it under your profile to read later, while swiping to the left removes it from your feed. Swiping left will help teach Pulse what kinds of stories you want to see and what to avoid going forward. It’ll take time to see how well that works out, but it’s a pretty important part of any news reader at this point — if you’re going to get stories generated for you automatically, users need to be able to clear out the clutter and focus in on what interests them. Pulse has survived for years, but will this new update keep it relevant? There’s no doubt that it’s a different app than the one it replaces — it’s no longer appropriate for digging through all of the stories posted by your favorite publishers. It’s going to be more focused on stories that have popped up in the last 24 hours, rather than seeing a long chronological list of content from a particular news source. And with your LinkedIn identity providing so much of the data used to serve you stories, there’s definitely a bigger focus on business than there was before. ""The hope is that we become a personalized business news digest for the user,"" says Kothari, ""and the key word is business."" People might already have way too many options for reading on their phones, but LinkedIn is betting that there are enough people interested in a business-focused view of the news for Pulse to continue to find a place on people’s home screens.",0.6138427355567472,0.3861572644432528,0.17931454050370768,694,4.7319884726224783,374,5.8235294117647056,0,2,"Apps, Business, Tech"

If this ruling is repeated in upcoming court cases, it could mean Uber would need to provide its drivers with benefits like health insurance and overtime pay. The company could also be on the hook for payroll tax, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, and state taxes. All that would drastically reduce the profitability of the fast-growing startup's current business model, which has powered it to a $40 billion valuation and massive global reach. ""With a business model based on offering affordable fares, these companies may not be able to survive a ruling against them in this area,"" argued Jennifer Robles of Owen Dunn Insurance. ""Without contractor status, it’s likely these companies could not continue at a profit, leaving traditional taxi drivers decidedly happier and thousands of Lyft and Uber drivers out of work."" Uber v. Berwick by Jordan Crook    The decision could add 30 percent to Uber's labor costs According the National Employment Law Project (NELP), a workers’ rights group, the change from contractor to employee could amount to an extra 30 percent in labor costs. ""Uber has had many bumps along its road, but this one is a genuine roadblock,"" said Forrester analyst James McQuivey. ""The entire model depends on fluid labor -- some will say exploiting labor, others will say liberating it. In the end, it only matters what the regulators say, and they have spoken, at least for now."" There are three critical factors the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers to decide if someone is an employee or an independent contractor: ""behavioral control, financial control, and relationship."" Uber has always maintained that it is a tech platform and marketplace connecting drivers and riders, not a traditional employer. But the fact that Uber controls both the fares and the driver's cut, as well as Uber's ability to decide what cars can be used and when to fire poorly rated drivers, convinced the commission that Uber drivers were employees under its behavioral and financial control. ""Uber exerts a lot of control over how its drivers behave."" ""Uber manages to exert a lot of control over how its drivers behave,"" says Alex Rosenblat, a researcher at Data and Society who has been studying the company and its relationship to its drivers. ""They can deactivate you for having a bad rating. They also make it possible for customers to reach drivers if they leave something behind after a ride. A driver will want to return that iPhone and keep their rating up, but has no way of being paid by Uber for that time."" The battle is far from over. ""Uber should and will appeal, but it may also be time for Uber to start showing some love to drivers, many of whom are watching their profits shrink as Uber grows and continues to position itself to be an investor darling,"" argues McQuivey. ""Regulators may or may not listen to reason, but they certainly listen to the cries of drivers and those who want their tax revenue."" In a statement, Uber said that the same California commission had ruled in its favor two year earlier and that today's ruling was non-binding.It also pointed out that the commission's ruling was confined to the single driver who filed suit. But today's ruling followed earlier legal losses for Uber and its rival Lyft from this past March, when two judges in San Francisco decided that juries would have to decide the status of the services drivers in larger class action lawsuits. The decision of the Labor Commission, which Uber is appealing, won't have any bearing on its upcoming court case. But it shows that drivers are finding ways to make a convincing case their status with Uber should be fundamentally reevaluated, and regulated. Given these uncertainties, it's easy to understand why Uber is investing so heavily in the development of its own driverless car technology. ""These guys will fight and avoid until they hit their end goal, which is the driverless car,"" says Chris Dolan, a lawyer who sued Uber over a fatal accident involving one of its drivers. ""The game is delay, make as much money as you can, then get rid of the problem.""",0.3548211449392676,0.6451788550607325,0.8329316652331983,746,4.9034852546916889,409,5.9926650366748166,1,0,"Business, Policy & Law, Tech, Transportation, US & World, Report"

The commission is charging AT&T with falsely labeling its plans as ""unlimited"" and not properly informing customers that their speeds would be slowed after it implemented throttling in 2011. ""Unlimited means unlimited,"" Travis LeBlanc, chief of the FCC Enforcement Bureau, says in a statement. ""As today’s action demonstrates, the commission is committed to holding accountable those broadband providers who fail to be fully transparent about data limits.""  The FCC says affected customers were throttled around 12 days per cycle The commission says that it's received thousands of complaints from consumers since AT&T's policy went into effect in 2011. As part of an investigation into AT&T's throttling, the FCC says that it found millions of people were affected, with affected subscribers on average receiving throttled service for 12 days per billing cycle. Though AT&T did make note of its changing policy at the time, the commission says that it was not adequate to fulfill the transparency requirements laid out in the old Open Internet Order, which mandates that carriers provide sufficient information so that subscribers can make informed decisions about their service. The fine is not final, as the FCC has only charged AT&T with violating the requirements so far. It's possible that the company will eventually settle, which seems to be how FCC fines take their course. However, AT&T says that it ""will vigorously dispute the FCC’s assertions."" It argues that the commission has ""identified this practice as a legitimate and reasonable way to manage network resources,"" although that's sort of ignoring what the FCC is actually saying. The commission isn't taking issue with AT&T's throttling for the purpose of ""reasonable network management,"" it's taking issue with AT&T throttling customers indiscriminately because they've used a lot of data. Notably, while this fine isn't particularly huge for AT&T, it is the largest proposed fine in FCC history and the commission is attempting to put it forward as an initial threat. A senior FCC official says that any future fine over this issue would be large enough to not be viewed as a ""mere cost of doing business"" for AT&T, which has apparently made billions on its unlimited plans.

It's part of Caviar's Fastbite service, which launches this afternoon in New York City, following a successful run in the Silicon Valley area. The offering is a piece of a broader trend in the tech industry, with companies like Uber, Amazon, and even Google branching out from their core competency and experimenting with ways to quickly deliver groceries and meals. A lengthy article in The Wall Street Journal yesterday examined Uber's struggles to find traction for its UberEATS service. While it has hundreds of thousands of cars operating in major cities at all times, the logistical challenge of parking, picking up, keeping food warm, and finding the customer, has resulted in an experience best summed up as ""lukewarm burrito.""

The end goal is very different for Square than for a service like Uber.

Uber, by contrast, is trying to find more ways to squeeze revenue out of its network of drivers and justify its massive $40 to $50 billion valuation.

Chen Zhimin, China's deputy minister of public security, tells the Times that the ""network security offices"" will be installed at major Chinese web companies like Tencent and Alibaba, ""in order to be able to find out about illegal internet activity more quickly."" The plan was announced Tuesday at a national working conference in Beijing, though details on its scope and implementation remain unclear. The move follows a draft cybersecurity law, presented earlier this year, which calls for tighter controls over internet companies. The law would require web companies to store user data in China, curtail online anonymity, and share data with the government. The draft has drawn swift criticism from civil liberties groups, who say it will only further restrict speech in an already stifled country. ""A clear and chilling message."" ""While the Chinese government is known for its obsession with Internet control, the draft law sends a clear and chilling message of intent to further control online expression,"" Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement this week. ""The law will effectively put China’s internet companies, and hundreds of millions of Internet users, under greater state control."" Chinese internet companies already deploy armies of online censors to swiftly remove content deemed objectionable, including rumors and anti-government messages.

People like Mark Zuckerberg are known names, of course, but the army of coders, writers, and engineers behind them aren't readily accessible to those who aren't in the know. Tech entrepreneurs Gina Trapani and Anil Dash want to better connect the people in these networks, while also creating an avenue for long-excluded women and people of color to join in. Thus they created Makerbase, a kind of LinkedIn for techies that shows what digital creators are up to everyday. ""If you love apps, there was no way to know who made them."" For Dash, that the talent behind so much of what makes the web work is often invisible seemed like a unique problem worth addressing. ""If you love movies,"" he told The Verge, ""you can sit through the credits, and if you love music, you can read the liner notes. But if you love apps and spend all your time on websites, there's no way to know who made them."" Therefore, the guiding ethos for Makerbase is to expose what people do in as clear terms as possible. After logging in with Twitter, users will find people's profiles showing what they've built or contributed to, along with a whole host of projects like apps or even artwork. And developers and projects alike are easily searchable and editable a la Wikipedia. So for an example: say you've come across a engineer who helped design Pinterest. Searching for the engineer will expose what else they've worked on. Meanwhile, searching for Pinterest will expose the other people who worked on it with them.   Using Makerbase this way turns it into a powerful networking tool. And since there's no hierarchy or status structure underpinning the site, there are no boundaries keeping people from reaching out to one another. That means that those who traditionally have difficulty breaking into the tech industry will finally have access to a hopefully more inclusive online community. Breaking down barriers ""Aside from the skills of learning how to code or design,"" Dash said, ""one of the biggest gaps for any underrepresented community is to break into that network. What Makerbase does is make that visible so that anybody can find their way in."" That's why Makerbase is launching officially at today's White House's first-ever Demo Day. Announced earlier this year, President Obama intends on highlighting the talents of developers and innovators from across the country, regardless of their connection to Silicon Valley. The idea is to address the lack of diversity in the tech industry. In a Medium post published last month, White House officials Thomas Kalil and Terah Lyons wrote: ""Metrics that track participation in the American innovation economy show low participation rates for females and under-represented minorities in the technology sector and the entrepreneurial community. Just three percent of America’s venture-capital-backed startups are led by women — a figure that drops to around one percent for African American and Hispanic entrepreneurs. Only about four percent of U.S.-based venture capital firms have any female investing partners at all. And capital is predominantly available in just a few places, making high-growth business creation a challenge outside of a handful of coastal metro hubs."" And Makerbase is already growing. After building the platform in January, Dash and Trapani invited a handful of programmers to help test the site. In the months since, the site has blossomed organically to more than 100 users who improve on one another's profiles to expand on what they and their colleagues are working on. Tech companies like Twitter and Facebook have already released diversity reports showing where they need to improve when it comes to their hiring practices, and work is being done to bring disenfranchised groups into their ranks. Showcasing the work of those who might not have been noticed before is an excellent start that could benefit the entire industry.",0.6292174848288865,0.3707825151711135,0.8551780238199207,665,5.1082706766917294,398,6.1658291457286429,0,2,"Culture, US & World, Web, Report"

Skidmore studied film, but also worked on more films outside of school than most people I met. His work, beginning as an intern and production assistant (or PA) a decade ago, has led to his current enviable role at a production company responsible for some of the most critically acclaimed comedies on television. He's credited as the producer on Inside Amy Schumer, Louie, Broad City, Difficult People, and other films, television shows, and comedy specials. So you're head of production for Jax Media, what does that mean? That means that every show our company does, I interface with the network, do the series budget, manage the funding from the network, deal with the unions, and in sort of a macro sense deal with the crew stuff and logistics of making the shows. I've visited your office. I originally imagined making comedy as this wacky, non-stop party. But it's a real job. There are offices and calendars and spreadsheets. There's a ton of money at play. How do you strike that balance between the reality of production and producing a funny show? We approach it by making a firm plan up front. We schedule everything meticulously. We [tell the comics], hey, we think this is ambitious but doable. Or this might be a lighter day or a heavier day. The more they are aware, the better off you are. ""The looser and funnier things can be, the more the crew enjoys working."" The set needs to be fun, because a lot of these comedies don't have big budgets, and they're on a  tight schedule. So I think the looser and funnier things can be, the more the crew enjoys working. There are long hours and not great pay. If you can make everyone laugh on set two times a day, it makes the job better. It's definitely better than working on a drama. Who is the funniest person you've worked with? That is really tough. I'll give a two-fold answer. Louis [C.K.] is the greatest comedian certainly that I've ever seen. I haven't seen a ton of comedians, but just everything I see him do is brilliant. I would say in person — in real life — Abbi [Jacobson] and Ilana [Glazer, the co-creators and stars of Broad City] are some of the funniest people I've ever met. What's your favorite memory from working with them on Broad City? The most memorable experience we had with them was the St. Marks episode, which we did as the finale of the second season. We shot on St. Marks four straight nights. All overnights. All together. It's almost like a sleepover party, from sundown to sunup. We had that sort of giddy exhaustion, because no matter how much you sleep during the day, you're still not nocturnal. But they were game for everything. It felt like a unique episode for the series, just because of how it was conceived and pulled off. We had that sort of giddy exhaustion We rarely shoot episodes in a row. We usually shoot two or three episodes at the same time and take bits and pieces from each one. That was the same episode straight through, so we really got to build the momentum of the episode. What's the craziest thing to happen on your job? One of the craziest things we've ever done is we created a hurricane on Louie on the Upper West Side and in Red Hook. That, from a production sense, is one of the craziest things I've ever been a part of.   Do you remember your worst day on the job? I feel like there's one a month, or one every show. There's a day where you feel like everything goes wrong. You have to take a deep breath and get through it, because it always turns out fine. Does it turn out fine because you make it fine? It turns out fine because the whole job is problem solving. There are a thousand fires around you, and you have to take them one at a time or else you're just going to sit there and burn alive, essentially. There could be a problem with the location or some other thing, and it's like alright, one at a time. Fix this problem, and it'll help fix the other problems, and you'll bring things back to reality. What's the strangest request you've been given on a set? We were shooting a movie, and we were at a remote mansion in Long Island. We were doing a wedding scene, and we needed mani-pedi people. I think we had actors, but the director wanted people who could apply a mani-pedi for real. So they sent me into town, and I went to a nail salon and recruited two people who didn't really speak English to come with me to a mansion and put them on camera. The whole job is problem solving They showed up. I didn't actually think they'd show up, but they did a couple hours later and hung out with us. How did you end up in this job? I went to film school at NYU. I started interning my sophomore year. I worked on a movie called The Hottest State with Ethan Hawke. The [president] of Jax Media, Tony, was the production manager on that movie. So I worked with him for a few movies over the course of a couple years. Once I graduated, I started working on TV with him, then I joined Jax when he formed the company in 2011 or 2012.   What's your best career advice for someone wanting to get into what you do? I still think interning, despite lawsuits to the contrary. I think it's the best exposure. As an intern you can work on several different things in the same week. Shows hardly ever employ people for full weeks anymore, so you can do like two or three internships. A lot of people who intern at Jax do that. It gets you exposed to a million different fields and opportunities and people. We have a concerted effort to hire from our intern base. Say it's me. I'm almost 30 years old. I say, ""Hey, I want to work in the industry."" Should I go back to school? Should I be a production assistant?' I think PA-ing is the best. I have a strong opinion that the best experience is in the field. School is great as a base of knowledge and a place to meet people, especially undergrad.

It's a really nice change of pace! Now trailers are rolling out for thrillers and serious dramas, and a lot of them look really good. Head below to see 13 of the best trailers that came out this week.   Concussion could be a harrowing look at the damage done to NFL players' brains and the NFL's troubling choice to ignore it... or it could be a watered down version of that story to make sure that no one gets too upset. It's too soon to tell, but this trailer makes it seem like Concussion is shooting for the former. Also: how weird is it to see Will Smith be so stoic and sad; also also: it's still very hard to separate serious Alec Baldwin from 30 Rock Alec Baldwin. The film comes out on Christmas Day, so go see this if you want to upset your entire family.   Netflix's first movie comes out in just over a month, and it looks like it's going to be a good one. Beasts of No Nation follows a child in West Africa who's forced to become a soldier after being split from his family. Between director Cary Fukunaga — of True Detective season one — and Idris Elba — the world's prediction for the next James Bond — there's a whole lot to like in here. It premieres on October 16th.   Three more weeks. The Daily Show returns on September 28th, and Comedy Central has been letting out little teasers to preview the show's new sensibilities and style until then. So far, it's hard to say that a lot has changed — aside from that music, at least. For now, we're hoping it's just a placeholder.   Downton Abbey's sixth and final season is about to begin. A first trailer for it premiered this week, ahead of the series' return to ITV on September 20th. It'll come to PBS several months later, on January 6th of next year.   Hand of God was among Amazon's standouts when its pilot premiered last year. The episode certainly had its problems, but it was hard not to want to see more of a half-crazed Ron Perlman doing whatever the hell he wanted. Now, we're finally getting to. Hand of God's first season premieres today on Amazon Video — it should give you plenty to do over the long weekend.   If you watched the VMAs last weekend, you probably caught a first look at MTV's new fantasy series, The Shannara Chronicles. Pretty much everything that can possibly happen in a fantasy show appears to happen here, and somehow Jon Favreau is involved. But hey, it seems like a surprisingly epic series for MTV — and it's almost certainly going for the Game of Thrones crowd that can't get enough. It starts in January.   Am I too excited for a Macbeth adaptation? Seriously, just watch 30 seconds of this: Michael Fassbender! Marion Cotillard! Those insane insane insane landscapes! I'm sold. It's out December 4th.   This one could get a lot of attention: The Danish Girl comes from the director of The King's Speech and is about a painter beginning a public life as a trans woman. The film looks absolutely gorgeous, and, at least in this trailer, Eddie Redmayne seems to be doing a wonderful job as its star. It'll be out November 27th.   I really don't want to spoil anything in here because it's just so bizarre and wonderful. It involves Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, weird romance, and turning into animals. It's out October 16th in the UK.   Here's a trailer for a thriller that actually feels thrilling. I have no idea what's going on in The New Girlfriend, but whatever it is seems tense, sexual, and secretive. It opens September 18th.   In July, Barack Obama became the first sitting president to visit a prison, and Vice and HBO were there to document it. Their report, Fixing The System, has Obama sitting down with Vice founder Shane Smith to discuss the issue of mass incarceration and America's problematic war on drugs. It'll air September 27th on HBO.   The director of Jiro Dreams of Sushi has a new documentary coming out. A Faster Horse goes inside Ford to look at the creation of the Mustang, its current role in the company, and the impact it's had on car fans and American culture. Even if you're not into cars, this seems like it could be an interesting one. It'll be available to rent on Vimeo starting October 9th.   I get the impression that Daniel Radcliffe wants to have the same kind of career as James Franco, but he keeps getting involved in projects that are crazy but serious, rather than just crazy. So it's just as a matter of course that Radcliffe is now playing one of the masterminds behind Grand Theft Auto in a movie for the BBC. It's hard to tell exactly how this is going to turn out, but it seems safe to guess this won't be the next Social Network. It premieres September 15th.",0.514626360865623,0.48537363913437703,0.12518778807570277,893,4.3751399776035838,480,5.5374999999999996,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Film"

I'm Jamieson, I'm still your host, and I’m looking forward to a relaxing Labor Day weekend before Apple hysteria reaches a fever pitch next week. Let’s all dream of one last weekend spent lounging in the sun, our heads free of iPhones and Watches! As per usual, there's a Spotify playlist at the end for your listening convenience, and you're also welcome to share your own favorite cuts and complaints in the comments. Let's go: Alessia Cara, ""Seventeen"":  This is the first song on Alessia Cara’s debut EP Four Pink Walls, which was released last week. If you’re familiar with Cara, it’s probably because of her single ""Here,"" the piece of anxious pop-soul that lifted her from a world of acoustic covers on YouTube into a record deal with Def Jam. ""Seventeen"" doesn’t have the same crackle or preternatural wisdom — it sounds like a decent Lorde song, I guess — but it captures something specific and true about being young, when all it takes is a year or two to feel like a completely different person. It’s a precious, natural phase, and Cara brings it to life here. All Dogs, ""How Long"":  If you liked this year’s records by Waxahatchee and Hop Along, I’m positive you’ll have a great time with Kicking Every Day, the debut full-length by All Dogs. In terms of intensity, it’s pitched somewhere between the former’s low-stakes shamble and the latter’s white-knuckle howling; it helps that lead singer Maryn Jones sounds a lot like Katie Crutchfield. If you can pick apart the words Jones is singing underneath coarse waves of guitar, you’ll find a piercing song about trying to balance vulnerability and guardedness. The rest of the album’s worth your time too. Battles, ""FF Bada"":  Mathy experimentalists Battles are almost ready to release La Di Da Di, their third album and first in four years. (It’s out on September 18th.) ""FF Bada"" is a great reintroduction to the band’s unique skill set, one I prefer to other recent single ""The Yabba."" It’s intricate, brawny, and dynamic, and it crams a ton of action and movement into under five minutes. Beach House, ""PPP"":  This is my favorite song on Depression Cherry, the excellent new Beach House record I reviewed last week. ""PPP"" has the same impeccable pace and structure you’d expect from a good short story or film, and it earns the oft-used (re: this band) descriptor ""cinematic"": there are spoken word segments, furtive glances, leaps of faith, and a soaring, extended wordless climax. The song takes everything Beach House does well and blows it up to the largest possible size. Find some time this weekend to put this on your headphones and go out someplace where you can see the stars. Destroyer, ""Bangkok"":  ""Bangkok"" is Dan Bejar at his most blasé on his recently released Poison Season; the lyrics fall out of his mouth like he’s lying in bed on a humid day and can’t be bothered to stand: ""Like you, I’ve been around the world, seen a million girls… I’ve seen Bangkok."" He’s brought to life by greasy horns and strange news about someone named Sunny. This song makes me want to take a shower, and that’s somehow a compliment. Fake Palms, ""Melatonin"":  Toronto’s Fake Palms released their debut album last week, and it’s full of scuffed-up noise-pop sparklers like the one above. It all sounds a little like Deerhunter c. the second half of Cryptograms, or maybe like a mud-splattered version of The Strokes. ""Melatonin"" rides a fantastic set of guitar melodies into a dreamy, chugging outro; the subject matter’s just what you’d expect for a song named after a hormone that helps prepare us for darkness and sleep. Florence + the Machine, ""Queen of Peace (Hot Chip Remix)"":  Hearing a song you’ve come to love remixed can feel like running into a friend who’s undergone an impressive makeover since you’ve last seen them. Their hair’s been cut, their clothes are nicer, there’s an extra spring in their step — it’s still them, but they’ve changed! Here Hot Chip transform Florence + the Machine’s gusty, sweeping ""Queen of Peace"" into a kinetic, funky house cut. If you’re like me — a ""Sweet Nothing"" fan who’s always happy to hear someone embracing Florence’s inner club diva, that is — you’ll want to press play. Kelela, ""Rewind"":  Kelela established herself as a force working on the fringes of R&B with a fine 2013 mixtape, Cut 4 Me, and she’s following it up with an EP called Hallucinogen this October. She’s a flexible and skilled collaborator, and on ""Rewind"" her work with producers Kingdom and Nugget yields a slice of dewy, nocturnal club music. When a crush has you feeling completely frazzled like Kelela is here, the least you can do is try to dance away the cobwebs — this’ll make for an able soundtrack. Maddie & Tae, ""Sierra"":  Maddie & Tae made a splash last year with their debut single ""Girl in a Country Song,"" a fiery rebuke for all of the ball-capped bro-country upstarts that have dominated the genre’s charts in recent years. (A stinging sample: ""We used to get a little respect / now we’re lucky if we even get / to climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut, ride along / and be the girl in a country song."") ""Sierra"" is a highlight from their new full-length Start Here, and it reveals them to be equal-opportunity lyrical assassins. A snooty, salty Regina George-type is the target here, and they cut her to ribbons. It’s a hilarious, hearty listen. The Weeknd, ""In the Night"":  If you kept up with our extensive VMA coverage earlier this week, then you know that Abel Tesfaye emerged one of the night’s winners. His explosive performance of ""Can’t Feel My Face"" was an obvious highlight from the festivities, and his new album Beauty Behind the Madness is set to achieve one of this year’s highest first-week sales totals. ""In the Night"" is poised to become its next big hit once ""Can’t Feel My Face"" starts to slide down the charts: it’s Tesfaye’s most focused single, a slab of dark disco with obvious pop ambition and Max Martin’s Midas touch. I’m positive you’ll be sick of this in a few months, but it’ll sound intoxicating on your first dozen plays. Here’s this week’s playlist — have a lovely Labor Day weekend!

But the only thing that seemed more alluring than watching The Goonies back then was actually being one. And next year, I might finally get my chance. In an interview with Yahoo Movies, Goonies director Richard Donner revealed yesterday that he is planning an unorthodox ""immersive theater"" adaptation of the movie. In what sounds very much like Sleep No More, Donner explains that  the show will be staged in a warehouse with no seats, allowing the audience to be a part of the story, because making children (and likely, many grown adults) crawl over decaying skeletons and do the Truffle Shuffle is always a good idea. ""You become part of it, and you travel through with actors,"" Donner told Yahoo Movies. ""It's very popular now... It will take another year or so, but it's going to be wonderful."" There are basically no details about it at the moment, but having a bunch of people try to avoid One-Eyed Willie's traps is just too delicious of an idea to dismiss completely. Donner has been known to cast about rumors before — like last year when he said he would be making a sequel — so it could very well amount to nothing.

When Alex Gibney premiered Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine at SXSW, a group of Apple employees in the audience walked out. That's okay with him — the director behind 2005's Enron exposé The Smartest Guys in the Room and Scientology documentary Going Clear isn't known for shying away from complex topics. Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine hits theaters, iTunes, Amazon Instant Video, and on demand systems today, and it's already provoking a wide range of reviews and discussion. In March, our own Bryan Bishop called it an ""unflinching look at the emotional shrapnel people took when they were part of Jobs’ life,"" and that focus sets it apart from the growing body of work that celebrates Jobs' accomplishments in business and technology while glossing over the depth of his character. I spoke with Gibney earlier this week about the movie, what he'd learned while making it, and the future of Apple. So it's a pretty dark movie. Even some of your music choices — it's not like always uplifting, there's a real darkness to it. Gibney: I would say it's light and dark. The moment at the beginning where you're hearing the studio version of ""Tambourine Man"" and you're seeing all those people hold up their iPads with candles on them, there's a stirring of some real pathos there. And that was not mocking or meant to be ironic. We certainly found things that caught our eye, and a number of them were interviews with Steve. One is an SEC deposition, which actually helps to form a rough structure of the overall film. And one is an interview with Steve where he's talking to a very small Silicon Valley group. It was a very much off the beaten track kind of video, and he's not trying so hard to impress, he's thinking a little bit more thoroughly. That's the one where he talks at the end about how we’re all a piece of sedimentary rock and then the next layer forms on top of us, and our contribution disappears. So I think that you begin to build with materials that you find, as they seem to be important. I don't think there was a grand design at the beginning, but there came to be a grand design at the end. I hadn't seen that SEC video, and it struck me how different Jobs is in that video compared to everything else. It's the least polished version of him. Why didn't you lean on that harder? Perhaps, perhaps, but those [answers] get technical awfully fast. I think that when you start out the film, he's giving you information about his life and his career, and you don't really understand until late in the film that it’s actually an investigation of a possible criminal activity. That was intended to be something of a surprise, but along the way it reveals things about him that are interesting: the kind of contempt with which he treats the questioners, the sarcasm he uses to answer many of these questions, and then the self-pity toward the end. He talks about how he was hurt because the board didn't award him a bigger compensation package. All of that I found terribly interesting. And his body language as well.  Very much so. ""I don't think there was a grand design at the beginning, but there came to be a grand design at the end."" It feels like the first act of Steve's life, the early Apple stuff and even a bit of the NeXT stuff is really well documented. There was no internet and there was no ability for Jobs to control the message, so there was actually some journalism being done around him, he gave access to people. It seems like that’s way more open.  And then as he came back to Apple, everything seems much more closed. What I've noticed in virtually every piece, even the Isaacson book where he had so much access to Steve directly, is there's a wall that goes up. It's hard to see the actual person behind some of these actions — you end up with Apple history, or even cultural history in the case of some of the products. But it's very hard to see Steve. Did you struggle with that? Do you think that you were able to get through it? I never saw it so much as walls going up as he was always constructing a persona for himself. And earlier on, you're right, he didn't have as much control over that persona as he did later, because he got a lot more power later. That to me is the big difference between early Steve and late Steve. The book by Brent Schlender and [Rick Tetzeli], Becoming Steve Jobs, makes the case that he changed as a person. I'm not sure I agree. I think he was the same, but he got more power later, and that made it difficult to see him as anything more than the character he wanted you to see, particularly on stage. And he'd begin to stage manage how his life was written, right on down to the photograph that Walter Isaacson used for the cover of his book. Jobs was very much controlling about his image, which he always wanted to be one with Apple. He never allowed some of his key lieutenants to speak out in public forums. He always resisted that. The walls did go up in a way, but he so carefully cultivated that personality. He stage managed a role that he felt he was born to play.   Obviously when the movie first came out, Eddy Cue tweeted that ""this isn't the Steve I know."" How do you respond to that sort of criticism? I don't know how to respond to it. First of all, I'm not sure Cue was at the SXSW screening. Do we know if he really was? I know a bunch of Apple people were. But you know, that's his opinion. I can tell you that a lot of very high-ranking Apple executives have seen the film, former high-ranking Apple executives, who don't have to be keepers of the flame, and they found it to be very accurate. In the years now since Steve has died it seems like his ability to stage manage his persona persists, and the real stories don't seem to be coming out. Particularly — and this is what I think of as the walls going up — his decision-making process around the later products has still not been revealed. The stories around him not paying Woz for Breakout have been revealed. The stories around the first Mac have been almost completely revealed. But we don't really know anything about the iPhone. We don't really know anything about the iPad and how these products really came about. Why do you think that persists?  I think it persists because they would almost certainly reveal that while Steve was a great storyteller at Apple, he wasn't always the person who was driving the products. He was the guy who would choose between two paths, but there are a lot of very smart people at Apple who are doing a lot of very good work. I wasn't there, but from what people have told me, it wasn't like Steve came into the office every day and then chiseled out a tablet of what was going to happen and how things were going to proceed. He was a band leader, and he knew it was very important to have very talented musicians in the band. But I think he decided that it was also important for the public at large — and some executives managed to make themselves comfortable with this because it seemed to make them a lot of money — that it was important for the public to feel that Steve did everything. That he was the grand vizier, that he could see into the future, that he was going home into his house at night and just imagining what the next product would be, and thinking about new tech and how it was going to be engineered and how it was going to be designed. My understanding is that it was not like that at all. That Steve was a storyteller, but not really the inventor. And that's not a story that Steve wanted anybody to tell. ""Steve was a storyteller, but not really the inventor."" You come back to that storyteller theme several times in the movie, but I think the answer you just gave me — ""Steve was great at telling the story but he wasn't actually the driving force behind the product"" — is more explicit than anything in the film. Is there a reason it’s not as explicitly stated in the movie? You know, sometimes I think it's a good thing to pull material out of the movie. But I think it's there. When you hear Jon Rubinstein talk about how the iPod was put together, it's clear that they were looking to do a music player, but they hadn't figured out how to make it work yet. And they didn't figure it out until Jon found that small drive. And that was just a kind of a peek, in a way, because this film is not really about the technology, it's not really about how each product was invented. It's really more about values, I suppose. But that gives you a little bit of a peek into how this stuff worked. I think it's worth it for people to look at the moment when Jobs comes back to Apple. A lot of the so-called ""dream team,"" that group that really brought Apple rolling back, were already in place when Steve came on board. I think that's present in the film, even though, as a narrator, I didn't feel compelled to say, ""Remember this."" I felt like, it's there, in a subtle way. You're saying it's not a film about the technology, it's a film about values, and Jobs comes back to values several times. You very sharply highlight how his early, rebellious values about controlling a large system don't necessarily mesh with his later values about protecting his own large system. As a person who covers Apple frequently, that’s fascinating. It's almost like, I think about it so much that I stop thinking about it. It was to me one of the most striking things about him and his growth. Even though he thinks he didn't grow out of those countercultural values, I think he took certain affectations from the counterculture and left some of the more deep-seated values, both from the counterculture, and frankly from his ""search for enlightenment,"" quote-unquote, behind. And I think he didn't really fully appreciate that he had left that behind. He starts out doing blue boxes with Woz, right? And yet by the end he's going after the guys at Gizmodo. Who you'd think actually had that same kind of renegade blue box spirit that he celebrated himself and liked to believe that Apple still represented. It’s the idea of this plucky startup. Apple wasn't a plucky startup anymore! And he never was able to reconcile himself with that idea. ""He starts out doing blue boxes with Woz, and by the end he's going after the guys at Gizmodo."" He was genius at creating the notion — and I must say I fell for it too — that by using these products you were somehow investing in a higher ideal. ""Think Different."" Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Rosa Parks, Einstein, you know. But actually, the way Apple ran wasn't really that different at all. In a corporate sense, they didn't think different at all! They thought pretty conventionally, really, except when it came to the products. That's when Steve’s zen-like focus was riveted on the idea that his products would be different because they would connect to people and be an extension of themselves. And that they would be designed beautifully, so that people would want them, desperately. That's where the iPod was revolutionary. But all the other stuff — when it came to workers in China or pollution in China — he wasn't thinking different. And it certainly wasn't counterculture values. I found it really interesting that for all the time he spent in Japan — there was something about going to Japan that seemed to loosen Steve up, and he became a slightly more compassionate person — yet with all of Apple's business in China, he never went there. Ever. That is fascinating. I'd never thought about it that way before. Tim Cook is always going to China. He's constantly talking about China.  Tim Cook and Jon Rubinstein. Jon Rubinstein was going to China so often that when he sat in 3C instead of 3B the stewardess said, ""Wait, don't you want your familiar seat?"" You touch on Lisa in the movie. Obviously she's an enormous part of that early Jobs arc, but you don't really touch on what his life was outside of Apple. His wife, or his three kids, or even to a certain extent Pixar. What was your decision process there? I thought long and hard about, particularly the Lisa and Chrisann Brennan issue. The reason I felt it was legitimate to go there as opposed to dealing at length with Laurene and the other kids was that Lisa was something that crossed over into the company. After all, he named a computer ""Lisa."" And that confusion between real life and the machine seemed very poignant in light of the other episodes in the film, and the other concerns of the film which is all about how we use technology. ""The Confusion between real life and the machine seemed very poignant."" Also, he used a lawyer in order to fend off Chrisann when she was trying to get a paltry amount in order to survive — he used the attorney who helped set up the Apple corporation originally, so there was an eerie kind of personal-corporate connection there that I felt was appropriate to look at. Yet, the reason I included the writing from Lisa later was that it also fit in with this theme about Japan. And I felt having shown that cruel moment where he tries to run from his paternity, it was only fair to show that he reconciled with Lisa even though their relationship was rocky off and on. And to give some sense of that relationship and not just leave it early. I didn't set out to make a complete biography of Jobs. It was intended always to be angled and speak to a few people and to focus on a few key things, rather then try to tell the whole story. Which if I had done, I'd have got bogged down in listing events rather then trying to probe their meaning. Pixar is a really interesting episode in Jobs' life, and I think as a manager, he was tremendously successful at Pixar. And his fortune was really made at Pixar. But his heart beat with the blood of Apple. That's really what he was all about. Pixar made him a lot of money, and I think he handled it very well, but it was all about Apple for Steve. At the end of the film you reveal that you’re an Apple fan as well, and you had bought into the myth of Jobs. Do you think that myth persists around Apple in the absence of Jobs? I'm going to the iPhone launch next week, and I think it's changed. I think in many ways that Apple feels like another company now. And their products are very good, but — The products are very good. I'm not sure I'd ever, having done this movie, I'm ever interested in really investigating the Apple Watch. I don't want to be prodded any more into doing stuff than I already am. I mean, look, here's the danger: when you design the marketing strategy for a company that revolves around one person giving you all these great gifts and looking into the future and telling you what's going to come next, well, when that person leaves it's bound to create a sense of disappointment. Jobs had a succession plan, but it wasn't a succession plan for the idea of how he presented Apple to the world. And I think one of the reasons that people wept when he died was that he was singularly associated as a human being with the growth of the personal computer, which became the way we all changed. So, yeah, it's inevitably going to feel like a different place because Steve isn't the face of it anymore. ""There's still a bit of ruthlessness leftover from Jobs in that company."" Do you think that they can succeed without the qualities Jobs brought to Apple?  I think they can. It's a big company with a lot of very smart people. But they'll have to figure out a way for themselves to change. And it's hard to keep hitting home runs all the time. You're going to have to go back to bunting and hitting a few singles and doubles. But there's still a bit of the ruthlessness left over from Jobs in that company, and that might not be such a good thing to hang onto. Apple fans are notoriously harsh about things they don't like or that are critical of Apple, and particularly of things that are critical of Jobs — what's the feedback been like?  So far, honestly, it's been pretty good.  Maybe the Apple people have been holding back. I know a number of Apple employees walked out of the SXSW screening, but that's kind of to be expected. I mean, if you attack the Pope, or if you speak ill of the Pope, many Catholics don't like it. And I think there is a kind of cult of Mac, but I hope I've created a space in this film to ask some questions, not only about Steve, parts of whom I greatly admire, but also about who we are and what our values are. Particularly as it comes to not only business but technology. Those are the far more important things, not whether or not I spoke occasionally critically about Steve Jobs. I hope a lot of Apple people will come to this movie and reckon with that. And discuss. I make films in order to stimulate discussion and to have people think about them after they leave the theater or stop the streaming on the computer. You brought up the Pope, and you brought up cults. And you made Going Clear which was about Scientology, and I'm wondering, that cult aspect around Apple, that almost religious fervor for the company and for Jobs, did those things strike you? Were there any similarities?  Yeah, there were some similarities. I don't want to overdraw them, because Scientology actively practices human rights abuses as part of the L. Ron Hubbard doctrine of fair game. And Apple doesn't do that, but Apple in its own corporate way can be very cruel to its critics, and very fastidious about protecting its image. I don't think that's really a good thing. So, yeah, there are aspects of it that struck me as being similar. I mean, it's funny, I sometimes do a number of projects at the same time, and along the way that I was making this film, I made a film about James Brown and about Church of Scientology and both ended up being very reflective of certain aspects of the Jobs film in ways I never expected. What do you think Jobs' legacy is?  The true legacy of Jobs was creating a sense of deep connection between people and computers. I really think that was his genius, and I think he succeeded in that. I think that people are now beginning to realize that there's a downside to that. That sometimes, when they look incessantly, like I do, at an iPhone instead of engaging in conversation it can be a bit of a problem. And I think that was baked in, unconsciously, to the character of Steve Jobs also. ""JUst because Apple is hugely successful, we don't have to make the same choices Steve did."" What I'm sad about — I see a lot of people in Silicon Valley who feel like they need to ape every aspect of Steve Jobs. So, ""let's not give to charity, that would be a fucked up, stupid waste of time."" You know, how does that compute? And how does being unnecessarily cruel to people or not reckoning with the kind of corporate responsibility that big companies should have to reckon with, how does that really advance the ball? Was it really necessary? I think that was a kind of peculiar petulance that Steve had that doesn't have to be observed. The guys at Enron were very consciously libertarian and quite cruel also, thinning the herd inside their own company and also practicing a ruthless kind of cowboy capitalism on the electrical grid in California, but when Enron failed, everybody didn't feel that that kind of cruelty or corporate irresponsibility should be mimicked. But now that Jobs is successful, everybody thinks you should ape everything about him, and one of the reasons I made the movie was to say, ""Some things were great. Some things were not so great. So just because Apple is hugely successful, we don't have to ape them all, we don't have to make the same choices that Steve did.""",0.6402676748659439,0.35973232513405606,0.15369206410874184,3620,4.4328729281767956,1140,6.1833333333333336,0,12,"Apple, Culture, Entertainment, Tech, Interview"

Mallow! Mallow! A few hundred billion light years from this world, where the air is little bit thinner and the kitchen tables are a little bit smaller, there exists a universe composed entirely of human thumbs. The lives of the thumbs will feel familiar to you, because their planet is a replica of ours. Our pop culture is their pop culture, but everything is a little off. Instead of Star Wars, they have Thumb Wars: the story of Loke Groundrunner, a brave young thumb who must save the universe from the Evil Thumbpire. Instead of Titanic, the have Thumbtanic, a tragic tale of two thumbs riding on a turbulent ship of love. And instead of The Godfather, it’s The Godthumb who fills his cheeks with cotton balls. Every hand has a thumb This is the world of Thumb!, a parody series created by Steve Oedekerk (the guy behind Kung Pow! Enter the Fist). Thumb Wars was the first installment in the series; it premiered in 1999 on UPN, a broadcast network you may or may not remember (it later merged with the WB to become The CW). The movie’s tagline, ""Every hand has a thumb,"" was at least kind of true, if nothing else. The rest of the 30-minute shorts that followed Thumb Wars, like Bat Thumb, Thumbtanic, and Frakenthumb, were released on DVD in the early 2000s.   If there was every any ardent cult fondness for these movies, it has largely been lost to the sands of time. That doesn’t mean you can’t watch all of the Thumb movies on YouTube, but a mention of ""Thumb movies"" to most acquaintances will likely elicit more raised eyebrows than looks of recognition. Thumb Wars only has 185,000 views on YouTube, and it’s been up there for at least two years. This beagle has 785,000 views, and it’s been up for less than a week. On an IMDb message boards, a user asks, ""Anyone else find the thumb movies really unfunny and bad?"" But most of the responses to that post are ""No, no one else thinks that."" Because here’s the thing: the Thumb movies are not bad. They’re objectively, scientifically, un-bad. And I’m going to remind you why. By ""scientifically"" I mean ""anatomically,"" and by ""anatomically"" I mean ""all of the characters are thumbs."" Because if you put a face on a thumb — a tiny, pinched visage with giant watery eyes and no nose — anything the thumb says will be a good joke. And for fans, the thumb aesthetic is recognizable enough that certain people start to look like thumbs. So why have these movies, these monuments of artistic achievement, been forgotten? I think it’s mostly because parody doesn’t have a long shelf life and it’s very easy to hate. There are four Scary Movies now, because as more horror movies come out, the previous Scary Movies start to feel irrelevant, or at least dusty. The films parodied in the first Scary Movie are either a) forgotten or b) classics, like Kazaam and Scream, respectively. It’s difficult to make fun of something nobody remembers, and classic movies tend to defy parody. Have you ever seen a clever Scarface parody? Thumb movies are happy being as obvious as possible, they don’t need to try to be anything more The Thumb movies manage to avoid these pitfalls, I think, because they’re presented from the start as insignificant. The characters are thumbs, and many of the jokes are centered around the fact that they’re thumbs. Thumb movies are happy being as obvious as possible, they don’t need to try to be anything more. The only character who shows up in every single Thumb movie is a character known as the ""Woo-hoo"" guy. He says ""Woo-hoo"" one time per short, and then he leaves. This is objectively dumb, but parody is one of the few formats in which dumb can really shine. Take The Blair Thumb and Thumbtanic, the stand-outs of the collection. The Blair Thumb stars Stressy, Jish, and Vic (short for Victim), who get lost in the woods while hunting for an evil thing. One night, the trio thinks they hear the Blair Thumb slowly creeping towards their tent, but the intruder turns out to be a shark. A shark in the woods — imagine! Later, when Stressy is alone and crying, she wonders out loud where the rivers of snot on her face are coming from, because she doesn’t have a nose.   You might recall a popular scene from Titanic, in which Leonardo DiCaprio’s Jack stands at the bow of the ship, throws his arms out, and yells, ""I’m the king of the world!"" This scene is in Thumbtanic too, except Jake’s line is, ""I’m the king of the globe!"" Then someone behind him yells, ""I’m a dentist!"" The jokes roll away as quickly as they land, and the thumbs move on to new jokes, scrunchy up their thumby faces with dumb, mindless glee. After the six installments of the Thumb series were released to a few golf claps, Oedekerk promised new movies were on the way: Thumbatrix and WTW: World Thumb Wrestling. They were both rumored to be coming out in 2003, but that never happened. (Though apparently a Kung Pow sequel is in the works). The series was revived again briefly in 2008 and 2009, when Cartoon Network aired Frakenthumb and The Blair Thumb on Halloween, but other than that, the Thumb empire has gone dormant. The Thumb series hasn’t left much of a digital fingerprint; its comedic style seems to translate best in person, when a friend tells you to watch this dumb thing. So while no Netflix robot will ever curate the Thumb movies into a Recommended For You list, take it from me, your friend: watch this dumb thing.",0.682021032129978,0.317978967870022,0.8181401805225565,969,4.6295149638802888,509,5.6620825147347738,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Film"

He’d previously worked at places like Lionhead and Bullfrog Productions, game studios where beloved titles like Dungeon Keeper and Fable were made, but he decided to make the move to TT for one very specific reason: “It was Lego,” he says. The same year Ricks joined the studio, TT released Lego Star Wars, a game that would fundamentally change the company. Games aimed at kids, and games based on licensed properties, don’t have the strongest track record, yet Lego Star Wars managed to be both and still have commercial and critical success. And the studio hasn’t slowed down — since the release of Lego Star Wars, TT has released 27 Lego video games. In 2007 the company was acquired by Warner Bros., and it now focuses on the brand full-time.  Later this month, though, TT will be breaking out of the formula that has brought it so much success, in favor of something more ambitious. Lego Dimensions, which launches on a range of platforms on September 27th, is a game that combines the Lego video games with actual Lego bricks and minifigs. It’s what’s known as a “toys-to-life” game, a new-but-lucrative genre that already features massive names like Skylanders, Disney Infinity, and Nintendo’s amiibo line. Because of this stiff competition, Dimensions is a game that has been in the works for a long time, with the studio starting work on the project eight years ago, while still continuing to pump out traditional Lego games simultaneously. TT was founded in 1989 as Traveller’s Tales. Its first release was a fantasy-themed action game called Leander, but it wasn’t long before the developer started focusing on making games based on films and other licensed properties. 1994 saw the release of Mickey Mania on the Sega Genesis, and in the intervening years Traveller’s Tales worked with big-name publishers like Sega, Activision, and Disney, among others. In 2005 the developer merged with publisher Giant Interactive to become TT Games, and that same year it prepared to launch a joint project with Lego and Star Wars studio Lucasarts. Given TT’s history, there was little reason to believe that Lego Star Wars would be anything more than a standard, forgettable tie-in video game. But Ricks says he saw the appeal straight away. ""People thought that it would be a great Star Wars game, but perhaps they didn’t expect it to become the phenomenon that emerged,"" he says of the feeling at the studio at the time. ""But as soon as I played the first Lego Star Wars game I could see how this could be continued to be adapted and expanded."" A large part of the franchise’s appeal is its sense of humor. It’s just plain funny to see serious characters like Darth Vader or the Joker or the T. rex from Jurassic Park rendered in Lego. ""What we’ve found is the darker, or the more evil a character is, the more inherently humorous it is when it’s represented in Lego,"" Ricks says. The shift to Lego also means that the studio can have a lot of fun with things: when Batman punches a bad guy, they’ll crumble into a pile of bricks, and in Lego Jurassic World you can dig up dinosaur bones and turn them into a bridge to reach higher parts of the level. It’s the same appeal as The Lego Movie, except TT was doing it nearly a decade earlier. The other part of the equation is the focus on cooperative play; these are games explicitly designed for parents to play with their kids. It’s a tough balance to strike, as kids games tend to be overly simplified to avoid frustration, which makes them boring for more experienced players. Outside of Nintendo, TT is one of the few developers that has managed to strike the right balance, and its games are consistently enjoyable and fresh. Each new property brings a new game element; the Star Wars games have a focus on vehicles and spaceships, for instance, while the Lord of the Rings games have an almost RPG-like structure. Of course, much of the appeal also comes down to the properties themselves, franchises like  Batman, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. Next year will see TT tackle Marvel with an Avengers title. The combination of humor, family play, and big names has made the franchise a success; the Lego games have sold more than 100 million copies as of last October, generating an estimated $2 billion in revenue. Those are big numbers, but the toys-to-life space has even bigger potential. Skylanders is the biggest name in the genre, and since 2009 it has generated $3 billion, selling more than 250 million figures. Other competitors, meanwhile, have seen success, but on a smaller scale; as of March Nintendo says that it has sold 10.5 million amiibo figures. Lego Dimensions will be looking to differentiate itself in a few ways. For starters, there’s the sheer number of diverse properties that will be smashed together in the game. Dimensions will include characters from:   It’s a huge range, and likely to grow bigger as new expansions and add-ons are announced. (If you’re wondering why Star Wars, the franchise TT built its name on, isn’t included, it’s because Disney just launched its own Star Wars-based toys-to-life game.) The other feature that makes Dimensions different is that the game uses actual Lego bricks and figures. The base game will include Batman, Wildstyle, and Gandalf minifigs, along with a Batmobile and a portal used to scan characters and vehicles into the video game. The car and portal are made of standard Lego bricks and pieces that you put together yourself. Characters and vehicles rest on an NFC-enabled base so you can scan them using the portal, and more will be sold separately. According to Ricks, one of the big reasons the game has been in the works for so long is the R&D required to create new Lego sets that would work with the game. They have to work as toys and be small enough for a child to play with, but they also need to fit alongside other Lego sets on the portal, so the vehicles you build can’t be especially large or unwieldy. And since each vehicle has three different variations, this took a lot of testing. ""Everything has been exhaustively tested by the Lego Group,"" he says, ""ensuring that there’s the right balance."" All of the Lego sets you see in the game started life as real toy bricks. The appeal is obvious, but that’s not a guarantee of success. Instrument-based music games were once gaming’s hottest genre before players became burnt out on buying lots of plastic instruments. The same could happen for toy games, too, now that there are hundreds of millions of plastic figures already out there. Lego is also coming to the game very late, as Skylanders launched in 2009, while Disney Infinity followed up in 2013. Families that are already invested in one series — full games cost upwards of $60, while individual figures are around $13 each  — are unlikely to want to take on another expensive hobby. That said, the Lego brand has proven very resilient. Last year it overtook Hasbro to become the biggest toy company in the world, and while The Lego Movie seemed like a strange idea at the time, it went on to gross more than $468 million. If there’s any company that could enter the toys-to-life field so late and still be a success, it’s probably Lego. ""We’re just concentrating on what we know, and what we do best, and what Lego does best,"" Ricks says of the market. Outside of Dimensions, TT is also continuing to grow Lego video games in different ways. There are still traditional TT-style Lego games like Lego Avengers in the works, but next year the studio will also launch Lego Worlds, a creativity-focused game that looks more than a little bit like Minecraft. (While the full launch isn’t until next year, Worlds is currently available as an ""early access"" game on Steam.) It’s not clear what form the Lego games will take in a few years time, but there’s a pretty good chance they’ll still be around one way or another. ""I think we’ll be crafting Lego games until I’ve got great grandchildren and long grey hair,"" Ricks says.",0.6129487499456997,0.3870512500543003,0.1929192478733318,1422,4.7756680731364272,650,6.2015384615384619,0,10,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Report"

The system employs sensors to figure out the best angle to approach a landing site, so the legs adjust themselves accordingly. In a test video shown on September 10th, DARPA showed the legs attached to an otherwise standard RC chopper as it touched down with two feet on an elevated piece of wood and two feet firmly on the grass — which is notable because it resembles the type of uneven terrain current landing gear is incapable of dealing with. Roboticists have long looked to insects for inspiration. Scientists have modeled miniature search-and-rescue robots after the cockroach, taking advantage of the insect's exoskeletal shell to bump up its agility and help it slide through small spaces. It's also been a valuable pastime for researchers to film insects with high-speed cameras, resulting in such nightmare fuel as a water strider-inspired jumping robot that can leap 5.5 inches off a liquid surface without creating a splash. After all, the course of nature has resulted in tiny critters capable of astounding feats when it comes to flight, carrying weight, and moving around with more than two legs. In case you were getting over a fear of insects Insects’ abilities to land on uneven surfaces have long fascinated designers in the aviation community, since ideal landings aren’t always possible — especially in the cases of disaster relief and military operations. With adaptive landing gear, DARPA says helicopter pilots will be able to take off and land on angled, weirdly shaped, or even moving surfaces, like the surface of a ship in rough waters. DARPA has been designing the tech with the Georgia Institute of Technology, which will continue further development on the project.

Almost every new Android handset features some sort of solution for giving it a rapid injection of energy, and one of the most popular varieties among them is Qualcomm's Quick Charge. It's an option built into the company's current line of Snapdragon processors, and it's getting an upgrade to version 3.0 with the 2016 family, headlined by the Snapdragon 820. A new Intelligent Negotiation for Optimum Voltage (INOV) algorithm will allow portable devices to ""determine what power level to request at any point in time for optimum power transfer, while maximizing efficiency."" Together with a series of other advancements, this will result in 38 percent more efficient charging than the second-generation Quick Charge, and a doubling of charging speed from the original Quick Charge 1. In practical terms, says Qualcomm, this will mean that the typical smartphone can be recharged from a flat battery all the way to 80 percent in 35 minutes. Qualcomm also notes that it's implemented ""additional steps to help protect battery cycle life,"" so its new solution should be both more efficient and more forgiving on the battery. The Snapdragon 820 chipset will be joined by the Snapdragon 620, 618, 617, and 430 in supporting the latest variety of Quick Charge.

For Logitech's Ultimate Ears, the answer is make it louder, improve its wireless range, and give it a more durable design. Add those refinements together and you get the UE Boom 2, the sequel to our favorite portable speaker. Priced at $199 just like its predecessor, UE Boom 2 will hit retail shelves this month. It's been three whole years since the original Boom made the case for everything a Bluetooth speaker should be; does its successor make for a compelling upgrade? Based on outward appearance, you'd have an incredibly difficult time telling these products apart. Even the packaging is identical. The UE Boom's design has returned practically unchanged (aside from new color options). It's still a cylinder that puts out 360-degree sound, and you still control volume by hitting two oversized buttons running down the speaker's frontside. On top is a power button and another button that you'll hold to sync with your phone or some other Bluetooth playback device. On bottom is a flap that covers up the microUSB charging port and a 3.5-millimeter AUX jack. And that's it. The whole thing remains super portable and easy to throw into your bag or carry in your bike's water bottle holder. There are some exterior changes; you just can't see them. Like the original Boom and its also-excellent, smaller sibling, the Roll, UE Boom 2 is covered in Ultimate Ears' acoustic fabric material. This time it's no longer just water resistant, though; the new model is now full-on IPX 7 waterproof, a huge plus if you're planning to listen to it poolside or at the beach. The UE Boom 2 has also been designed to withstand and survive drops from up to 5 feet, so all in all it's substantially more ""lifeproof"" than the outgoing version. It's Louder and now IPX7 waterproof The other big improvements come thanks to what's inside. This speaker gets 25 percent louder than the original UE Boom, according to Ultimate Ears, and wireless range has been extended to 100 feet — up from 50. So you can start a playlist and keep your phone farther away from UE Boom as the tunes play. So far as features go, about the only thing that's gone unchanged is battery life, with the UE Boom 2 offering the same 15-hour stamina that we saw from the original. Like last time, you can buy two UE Boom 2s and pair them together for a richer stereo listening experience. They can also be configured to play the exact same thing if you're pairing with a UE Roll or putting each Boom in a different room for a Sonos-like setup. Ultimate Ears still isn't trying to pursue Sonos on the multi-room front, however, with the accompanying UE Roll app limited to delivering firmware updates, customizing the EQ profile, and using the speaker as an alarm clock. In our time testing the UE Boom 2, it's indeed proven to be a bit louder than the first one, though the soundstage and general audio tone have stayed close to the original. The doubled wireless range is also noticeable if you're someone who frequently walks away from the speaker with your phone in hand. It'll still double as a speakerphone for calls in a pinch, though music is very much this device's foremost purpose. The Bluetooth speaker market is getting more crowded than ever, but Ultimate Ears clearly hasn't felt any pressure to reinvent the UE Boom. The UE Boom 2 is iterative in every sense, improving upon the original in ways that will be appealing to new buyers. But aside from proper waterproofing, there's little here that'll give owners of the original any desire to upgrade — at least right away. And as the company's own $99 Roll shows, you can get plenty of speaker for half of the Boom's asking price. The UE Boom 2 will be available this month in six colors (Cherrybomb pictured here) from Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers for $199.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) — the regulatory group in the European Union which roughly parallels the FDA — gave a positive opinion of the vaccine, saying it is safe and effective to use in babies at risk for the parasitic disease. With this ""green light,"" the World Health Organization will decide later this year whether or not to recommend the shot for use.  The vaccine RTS,S, also called Mosquirix, is the product of British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline and is partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It's not the only vaccine developed to fight malaria; an experimental malaria vaccine called PfSPZ was found to be much more effective at preventing malaria infection. Yet Mosquirix is the first to make it this far along in the approval process. ""This vaccine could mean children will have only two bouts of malaria a year instead of five."" Mosquirix helps to prevent infection from the Plasmodium falciparum, one of the deadlier malaria parasites. The vaccine prompts the body to produce a higher amount of antibodies to stop the parasite from infecting the liver. It's made specifically to combat infection in children and isn't intended for use in adults or travelers. However, the shot comes with its share of controversy. Early results of a clinical trial of Mosquirix showed that three doses of the vaccine could cut the risk of infection in half for children between between five and 17 months old. For younger infants between six weeks and 12 weeks, infection was reduced by only 30 percent. Over time, the effectiveness of Mosquirix waned unless children were given a booster, and children's chances of getting severe malaria or dying did not change at all. Some scientists are concerned that the potential costs associated with such a complex and somewhat ineffective vaccine may outweigh the benefits. Still, Africa is in desperate need for a malaria vaccine, even if it's only partially effective. Malaria infection — spread through the blood by mosquito bites — kills upwards of 500,000 people each year. Half the world's population live in areas at risk of infection. ""This vaccine could mean children will have only two bouts of malaria a year instead of five,"" Dr. Martin De Smet, a malaria expert at Doctors Without Borders, told the Huffington Post.

NASA researchers say they've only seen this kind of surface activity before on Earth and Mars.  Previous images of Pluto's surface showed icy, frozen plains inside Sputnik Planum; the newest ones also show the ice is moving similarly to how glaciers flow on Earth. That means geological activity occurred recently on Pluto.   The New Horizons team is also using enhanced color photos to get a better understanding of the icy plain's composition. Differing colors inside the ""heart"" suggest that it is made of a reservoir of ices, and some of these ices are moving away from the region. The ice isn't standard water ice, either — observations from the Ralph instrument, which sees in infrared, indicate that Sputnik Planum is made of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane ices.   New Horizons is also getting more details about Pluto's atmosphere. After the spacecraft passed the dwarf planet, it looked back at the space rock with its Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), capturing the Sun streaming through the gases surrounding Pluto. These pictures indicate two distinct hazy layers — one 50 miles above the surface and another 30 miles up. However, the mists were seen as high as 80 miles above the surface.

Stand on the bridge of a container ship docked in a mega-port in Korea, however, and it's clear that's just not true. The global supply chain that brings us those tablets and phones, and pretty much everything else from our clothes and food to our toys and souvenirs, is nothing short of a moon shot itself — a vast, unprecedented engineering solution to a truly astronomical logistics problem. The fact that it's hidden from most people's sight, and that it has become so utterly reliable and efficient to the point of transparency, doesn't make it any less of an achievement of human technical endeavor. The fact that it's hidden from most people's sight doesn't make it any less of an achievement of human technical endeavor To find out more about this huge, invisible network, I accompanied a group of architects and designers called the Unknown Fields Division for a rare voyage on a container ship between Korea and China. The aim of the trip was to follow the supply chain back to some of the remotest parts of China and the source of our consumer goods — and what we saw as we travelled through mega-ports and across oceans looked closer to science fiction than reality. We're picked up at 9AM from our guesthouse in the Korean city of Busan by a local ""ground agent"" for the shipping company Maersk, whose ship will be carrying us for the next week. They have at least one of these personnel handlers in every major port in the world, their job being to ensure crew members make their way through each country's unique and complex maze of customs and immigration bureaucracy, and onto their ships on time. If you were asked to name some multi-national corporate brands you could probably reel off half a dozen, from Apple to Coca-Cola, but chances are that Maersk wouldn't spring to mind. Yet the Danish shipping giant is the very definition of a multi-national corporation, with over 25,000 employees, 345 offices in 125 countries, 600 active ships, and more than 2 million containers moved every year. The company is estimated to be responsible for 20 percent of Denmark's GDP on its own. Maersk might not make any of the things you buy in shops, but it more than likely put a lot of them there. As we drive along, Busan's dense mass of high-rise apartment blocks gives way to what will be one of the defining images of the next seven days; the giant cranes that line every major port in the world. Soon we're into the depths of Busan New Port itself, and speeding past endless, towering stacks of shipping containers until we're finally dwarfed by the huge, blue mass of the Maersk Seletar, the 320m-long (1,050ft), 80,000-ton, 9,000-container capacity ship that will be my home for the next seven days. It's not until we get out on to the towering balconies around the ship's bridge and look back at Busan that we're fully able to first comprehend the scale and nature of these Asian mega-ports. It feels like we're being given a rare look into a usually hidden space, a peek at the intricate but city-scaled machinery of global capitalism. From that viewpoint — essentially high above the sea, looking into land — it's easiest to describe the ports as a sequence of layers. First, towering above and over the ship, are the loading cranes. Vast structures mounted on huge, four-legged frames, they resemble the naked scaffolding of unbuilt skyscrapers, and trigger nostalgic reminders of Saturn V rocket launch towers from the 1960s. Their sheer size makes them the first thing you see when you arrive at any port — whether from land or sea, and as staggering as they are they don't make their full impact until you see them move. Built on tracks in the surface of the harbor side, they slide left and right, parallel to the berthed ships, accompanied by a cacophony of warning sounds and robotic safety announcements. Once in port at night I saw one suddenly fire into life next to the ship in a stroboscopic explosion of lights, before it tracked slowly above my high vantage point, bathing me in the orange glow of a dozen small halogen suns. It was an intense experience. The second layer in from the cranes are the trucks; a constant loop of circling, diesel-belching flatbeds. Endlessly, they arrive at the bottom of the vast cranes, seemingly one every minute when the port is at its busiest, stopping in precise locations so the crane drivers can either pluck their containers off their backs and on to the ships, or drop a freshly unloaded container straight on to them, before the trucks instantly pull away and head inland. It's a hypnotic, fascinating dance to watch: the cranes lifting containers off the ships, the trucks pulling up in time to catch them as they are elegantly lowered down on steel cables. The complex and precise orchestration behind every move is almost bewildering to comprehend. The ships never unload everything at just one port — that'd be hugely inefficient for these vast, globe-orbiting warehouses — so the crane drivers need to know which one to take off and when, just as the truck drivers need to know where to take each one they collect. It's the kind of logistical information that it's hard to imagine any one human mind comprehending, and the truth is no single one does — this is distributed knowledge, managed by Maersk's vast world-spanning computer network and shaped and interpreted by complex, similarly unknowable, algorithms. In a very real sense, the crane and truck drivers are little more than elements in a vast robotic system, receiving instructions in their cabs from their computerized managers, following orders on endless cycles until their shift ends. The crane and truck drivers are little more than elements in a vast robotic system, receiving instructions in their cabs from their computerized managers Not that there isn't a certain amount of pride in their work, as regimented and alienating as it might seem — it's not unusual to see the cranes decorated with awards and badges announcing record breaking container shifting performances. At the same time it's also impossible not to be struck by the precariousness of their job security; with so much managed by the network it must surely only be a matter of time before the system evolves enough to remove the human element entirely. In fact, ports like Rotterdam in the Netherlands have already moved to fully automated systems, with driverless trucks and robotic cranes. Layer three, sat behind the cranes and trucks, is the most easily recognizable image from the whole process: the container stacks. From the bridge of the Seletar they look like row upon row of repeating, multicolored Lego bricks, six units high, each straddled by multiple cranes — miniature versions of the ship loaders, sliding back and forth on rails. These cranes continually shuffle the position of the containers within the stacks themselves, following the algorithmic wisdom of the network to ensure everything is in the most efficient position possible; cargo heading backwards and forwards, inland and out. At every port we arrived at, the three layers — cranes, trucks, containers — seemed fundamentally the same, standardized with only the occasional exception. The Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung uses small, fast moving, mini cranes instead of trucks — oddly top-heavy looking skeletal machines that bounce along on huge moon-buggy tires. They swarm endlessly like busy robots, their blue or yellow frames smeared in grease and grime, discharging black clouds of diesel smog. It's only layer four that displays any individualization — the landscapes beyond the ports. In Busan it was housing blocks branded with corporation logos nestling beneath green mountains. And at Shanghai's Yangshan Deep Water Port it was the six-lane, 20-mile-long Donghai Bridge, built to carry the constant flow of container trucks in and out from the port, built on a vast artificial island. After three days at sea, we reach the city of Ningbo. Arriving into port at night we are presented with an almost nightmare vision, a Blade Runner-like landscape of glowing lights and smokestacks painting the low cloud ceiling orange. We'd been delayed going in as the black shadow of a ship owned by French giant CMA CGM slid gently past. It towers above ours, with a startling 18,000-container capacity. As soon as we hit port-side the cranes fired into life, the trucks queuing up as though impatient to make up the delayed time. The next morning, unable to sleep, I rise at 4:30AM and head for the top of the ship again, eager to see the port in daylight. The industrial landscape in front of me is vast and awful: a huge coal burning power station fed directly by incoming bulk carrier ships sits right on the port-side, its towers filling the sky with black, while the landscape behind is filled with refineries, gas storage plants, and tightly huddled together housing blocks. You can not only see the pollution — he vast carbon footprint of this industrial network — but taste it in the air. As much talk and concern as there is in the West about the environmental impact of China's economic dominance, it's easy to forget how much of that impact the Chinese people are taking as a direct hit themselves, as much for the West's benefit as their own. It's not just onshore environments that containerization has shaped and transformed. The surfaces of our planet's oceans — for centuries a space of mystery and myth, of expanse and desolation — have been rationalized and shrunk. Once an enigmatic, awe-inspiring place, the sea has become a zone of efficiency, little more than another channel for the automated supply chain network. Over the course of seven days there wasn't a single time when I stood on the bridge of the Seletar, even when deep at sea, that I couldn't look out and see other container ships, and a brief scan of the horizon with binoculars would usually reveal four or five more. The implications are even more startling when nearing a port, and seeing dozens of vast ships held at anchorage, lined up like trucks in a parking lot. The sea has become dominated by GPS tracking and auto-piloted navigation, where the shipping routes are more than just vague geographical gestures, but instead precise spaces traced out both by computerized charts and physical markers, with deep sea buoys marking lanes like the painted lines on road surfaces. Change the sea and change ships and it's impossible to not also change seafarers, although perhaps the impact containerization has had on ship crews is a little more subtle. Certainly, like the crane and truck drivers back at the port, there's a certain sense of alienation from the cargo. Nobody on the ship knows what lies inside the containers the ship carries. There are exceptions of course; hazardous materials must be declared, as must the contents of the refrigerated containers — known in the industry as reefers. The reefers themselves are fascinating pieces of technology, basic containers outfitted to be advanced, climate-controlled, computer-monitored micro-environments. Checking the reefers are running is the crew's only tangible, direct responsibility for the cargo beyond ensuring it arrives on time. Even so, it is still highly computer-controlled; the ship's captain, Brian Argent, tells me that the crew's emails piggy-back off a satellite uplink designed keep an eye on the reefers, transmitting status updates thousands of miles back to land so that the company's computers know about a problem before the ship's crew does. The reefers themselves are fascinating pieces of technology, basic containers outfitted to be advanced, climate-controlled, computer-monitored micro-environments And that's not all the ship receives emails about: Maersk regularly sends Argent and his senior officers messages informing him of course changes or of what speed to take. Even the captain has become just another node in the network, the running of his ship dictated by the unseen algorithms. The myth of the seafarer as the drunken adventurer with ""a girl in every port"" couldn't be further from the truth, with shore leave a rarity, and ports so far from urban centers that day leave excursions become little more than trips to out-of-town shopping malls to stock up on essentials such as shampoo, shower gel, and snacks. But for most of the Seletar's crew — made up of mainly Indian, Filipino, and Chinese seafarers — the reasons for going to sea are the same as they ever were:  to make money that can be sent home to their wives, children, and parents. And even the sense of distance from their families shrunk, thanks to the Seletar's satellite internet access. It's slow and patchy, but it's enough for the crew to maintain daily communication with home — with most of them spending a sizable chunk of their free time crouching in corridors and stairwells with smartphones and laptops, trying to find the elusive Wi-Fi signal so they can talk to home, send messages to loved ones, and connect to Facebook. It's a fascinating sight at first, and within a few days I find myself doing the exact same thing. I'd initially thought it might be fun — healthy even — to truly escape the internet and life back home for a few days. That was before I realized what the Seletar really was, saw how it was just another node in the network, another rationalized point in the global infrastructure, a bridge between the physical and digital. Once I saw that, I knew it was time to abandon my romantic notions of being away at sea, that it was pointless to resist the lure of the network, and found myself squatting in the stairwell between Decks C and D, trying to get reconnected.

Up until now, we've written about animals without telling you whether they suck or rule. We are now rectifying this oversight. The slow loris’s large, glossy eyes make it look a little like the model on which all Disney princesses are based. Its wide, inviting stare and fuzzy belly suggest it’s cuddly. But be warned: it may be adorable, but it’s also venomous.  The slow loris is the only known venomous primate. It has two brachial glands inside its front elbows; these glands secrete a fluid that contains an allergen similar to a chemical in cat dander. When a slow loris feels threatened, it raises its arms above its head and gives those glands a lick. The glands' fluids mix with the animal's saliva to create a toxic combination. This venom then gets injected into wounds when the slow loris bites. The slow loris is the only known venomous primate There are anecdotes of people who have gone into anaphylactic shock after getting nipped — though, granted, it’s only potentially deadly news if you have allergies. But even if you're not allergic, a slow loris bite is unpleasant. Its teeth are incredibly sharp, and the venom emits a nasty smell, ""worse than a whole box of rotten eggs."" Scientists also think the venom works like an anticoagulant, preventing the wound from healing and causing it to fester.   The slow loris raises its arms above its head when in a defensive position. (International Animal Rescue) One study suggests that the the species may have also evolved to mimic cobras — another defense mechanism for scaring off predators. When the slow loris puts its arms above its head in that fake-out surrender, the pose — combined with the dark markings on its face — gives the appearance of a cobra's hood. The slow loris has even been known to hiss when confronted. The slow loris is fairly chill But lethality and intimidation are usually last resorts; the slow loris is fairly chill. It makes slow, deliberate movements — like a sloth — and little noise. Its presence usually goes unnoticed by its prey, as it stays hidden and barely disturbs its surroundings. And its stealthy gait allows it to sneak up on its meals of insects, arthropods, reptiles, and small birds. That isn’t all it eats; the slow loris is omnivorous, snacking on fruits and nectars, too.  Most of the time, you'll find the slow loris in the leafy rainforests of South and Southeast Asia. But deforestation has put the slow loris on the IUCN’s threatened and endangered species list. Worse, some Cambodians believe that slow lorises have supernatural powers, such as the ability to ward off evil spirits or heal wounds. The animals are often sold — either alive or butchered — to be used in traditional medicine throughout the country.  Perhaps the main problem for the slow loris is that it's too cute. You may have seen videos pop up on YouTube recently, showing precious slow loris ""pets"" getting their bellies tickled or being fed rice balls. The videos make slow loris conservationists cringe. Despite the threats posed by deforestation, the species is most threatened by its inclusion in the exotic pet trade. People pay thousands of dollars to acquire slow lorises as pets, which can be bad for the animals, since they often have their teeth stripped out before they’re sold. Otherwise, owners might not find their bites so endearing. Maybe it's not a coincidence that the slow loris is similar in name to Sir Loras, the Knight of the Flowers from Game of Thrones. Both are great to look at, but they'll cut you if you dare to cross them — and right now, both are in serious peril.

A LinkedIn search reveals dozens of employees who hail from Tesla, GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler; Motor Trend notes that they've also brought on Richard Kim, who led design on BMW's i8 and i3 concepts, and Pontus Fontaeus, who's worked on interiors for Lamborghini, Ferrari, and Land Rover.

Those were the words of Alan Stern, New Horizons' principal investigator, at this morning's briefing. After more than nine years and 3 billion miles, the spacecraft is inside the dwarf planet's Hill sphere of influence and ready to take the first detailed measurements and photographs of Pluto.   New Horizons is already well within 1 million miles of Pluto and is rapidly approaching the 31,000 mile per hour flyby that will bring it within 7,800 miles (about 12,500km). Below you'll find a schedule of what's happening when, as well as when NASA will be doing live streams of the events here at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. But first, if you're not sure why we're heading to Pluto in the first place, our sister site Vox has put together a wonderful 3-minute primer: The New Horizons team has already solved one of the biggest mysteries about Pluto: its size. This morning, NASA announced that Pluto is 2,370km (about 1,473 miles) in diameter, give or take 20m. That makes it ever so slightly bigger than Eris, a much darker and denser object that lives farther out in the Kuiper Belt. (Eris measures 2,336km in diameter.) Measurements of Pluto's size before today were estimates at best, their accuracy skewed by the dwarf planet's hazy atmosphere. This morning also brought confirmation that Pluto has an icy polar cap, which is made of a mix of frozen methane and nitrogen gases. And while scientists had theorized that Pluto's thin atmosphere contained nitrogen, we've already learned that the gas is escaping Pluto's atmosphere much faster than expected. A lot. The increasingly detailed views of the Pluto system have ramped up speculation about what geographic features might be found on its surface. A few of these were discussed in the morning briefing. Pluto may have a subsurface ocean, which could be evidenced by plumes escaping the planet — team scientists will be looking for those when New Horizons is behind Pluto looking back toward the Sun. While there are also a few large craters, Pluto's surface isn't as pockmarked as something like our Moon. That's a reflection of Pluto's more recent origins. Many features are still to hard to resolve. For instance, the true nature of the large, black equatorial region is still unknown. There's also a mysteriously massive, white, heart-shaped region. NASA has been releasing incrementally better photos of Pluto and Charon for weeks now, but as New Horizons gets closer, the resolution of these photographs will increase exponentially. (The twitter bot NewHorizonsBot has been the best source for instant links to the newest uploads to the JUAPL server.) At around 11:15PM ET tonight, July 13th, the team will get a downlink from New Horizons that contains the best full-frame image from the black-and-white LORRI camera. (It will likely be released on the morning of the 14th, though.) After this, New Horizons will ""go dark"" as it prepares for its flyby tomorrow morning. Because the spacecraft is zooming past instead of entering an orbit around Pluto, the spacecraft has to completely focus its instruments to take full advantage of its proximity. New Horizons will make that closest approach — about 12,500km (or 7,800 miles) — at 7:49AM ET.   The most recent color views of Pluto and Charon, its biggest moon. (Note: this image has been composited and does not reflect the true orbit.)  All signs point to the spacecraft hitting its tiny 100km-by-150km (60 mile-by-90 mile) flyby window, and Stern said there's only a one in 10,000 chance that it will be impacted by debris. Still, New Horizons is traveling at about 31,000 miles per hour, so making contact with any piece of debris of significant size would spell immediate doom for the probe. NASA TV will hold a live broadcast for these activities from 7:30AM ET until 9:00AM ET.   Here's the stressful part: we won't know for sure that New Horizons successfully completed the flyby until much later in the evening. If it has, the team should receive a tiny amount of data from the spacecraft at about 9:02PM ET. Wednesday morning, at 7AM ET, team scientists will downlink the best full-frame image of Charon. We should also get a glimpse of Hydra, one of Pluto's other moons. And later in the day we should get what we have all been waiting for — the first high-resolution mosaic of Pluto will be released some time around 3:25PM ET.

The spacecraft sent back a signal at 8:53PM ET, confirming a successful completion of its flyby of Pluto. The news was announced in front of a packed house at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, the location of New Horizons mission control. ""We're in lock with telemetry with the spacecraft,"" Alice Bowman, the mission's operations manager, said from the control room. The signal was a tiny packet of data — no images or scientific measurements were included. That’s because New Horizons can’t talk to Earth and make observations at the same time. ""Any second transmitting information to Earth is a second looking away from Pluto,"" said Kimberly Ennico Smith, a deputy project scientist for New Horizons, as the spacecraft gave us a brief heads up to let us know it was still functioning before going back to its scientific mission. ""Today’s mission was just one more step on the journey of getting humans to Mars, because it gives us one more piece in the puzzle of our Solar System,"" said NASA administrator Charles Bolden, at a media-briefing-turned-celebration that immediately followed the announcement.   An emotional Charles Bolden addresses the crowd at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. The briefing felt less like a mission update and more like a rock concert — and the star was Alice Bowman. At one point, the guests and press began chanting her name. Bowman, the first female mission operations manager in the history of the Applied Physics Laboratory, likened the anxiety of waiting for New Horizons' signal to the struggles of parenting. ""You have a lot of faith in your children, but sometimes they don’t do exactly what you want them to do,"" she said. The successful signal eased those tensions for Bowman, who said New Horizons is ""on track and following the path that we’ve laid out for the spacecraft."" New Horizons’ next task will be linking up with Earth overnight. That communication, which will last several hours, will provide images 10 times the resolution of the ones we've already seen, and will also include information such as the color data from Charon and Pluto's other moons. Alan Stern, New Horizons' principal investigator, said the team nicknamed this downlink ""The New York Times dataset, because we think it’s going to be pretty interesting."" There's a lot of good data coming tomorrow Though the overwhelming odds were in favor of New Horizons, a July 4th software glitch raised tensions over the flyby, and the moments leading up to the transmission were stressful. The announcement of the ""all clear"" signal sparked an eruption of applause and a palpable air of relief. Stern, who was in many ways the public face of the mission, never wavered in his confidence that the spacecraft was alive. He and other team scientists put the chance of debris impact at around 1 or 2 in 10,000 at a morning briefing. ""You could fly hundreds of New Horizons through the system and expect them to survive,"" Stern said.   Alan Stern, New Horizons' principal investigator, addresses the media. New Horizons buzzed by Pluto at a distance of about 7,800 miles; the greatest dangers to the craft were dust and debris. What made the flyby dangerous was that it’s hard to see this stuff — if Pluto has rings of dust, they wouldn’t be as obvious as Saturn’s or Jupiter’s. Hitting even a tiny rock could have been fatal to the mission. As New Horizons speeds toward the inner Kuiper belt, the spacecraft will look back into the sunlight and try to study the dust surrounding Pluto. ""Rings are exciting for us to do scientifically, but the same dust there is a hazard to the spacecraft,"" said Henry Throop of the Planetary Science Institute, who helped work out New Horizons' hazard avoidance strategy. The possibility of a planetary dust cloud is only one of the mysteries that researchers are hoping to unravel. Scientists want to learn more about Pluto’s geology; they aim to find out what makes up its icy cap, its cliffs and mountains, the dark equatorial belt, and the lighter, heart-shaped plain. And that’s not all: Charon, Pluto’s biggest moon, has mysteries of its own. More information will be available in the coming months, as New Horizons begins beaming back the data it gathers. New pictures and scientific results will be released in the coming days, but the bulk of the data won’t start to come in until September, and it will take 16 months to receive everything New Horizons observed — meaning we won’t have a complete data set from the Pluto system until October 2016. Or, as Stern put it: ""The best is yet to come."" The best is yet to come After that, the picture is still unclear. New Horizons has enough fuel to last until the 2030s, but requires a mission extension to keep the staff with it. At the end of the briefing, a nine-year-old girl (one of a handful in attendance who were born the year New Horizons was launched) asked the panel a precocious question about this topic: ""What is the extended mission goal?"" John Grunsfeld, NASA's science lead, slyly dodged the question. New Horizons, he said, will go ""where no New Horizons spacecraft has gone before.""",0.8049264539308145,0.19507354606918548,0.8688282400496347,906,4.8763796909492276,468,6.0384615384615383,0,4,"Science, Transportation, Space"

Solar Impulse took off from Abu Dhabi in March, beginning its quest to fly around the world entirely on solar energy.

Although much of the excitement surrounding electric vehicles has been focused on consumer cars, some industry experts argue that it's in logistics where the technology could have its biggest impact.

""If you make that [car] electric you are going to add $15,000, at least, to the cost of that car and maybe only save $1,500 [in fuel]. So maybe a 10-year payback.

We're still hours away from receiving confirmation that New Horizons lived through its flyby of Pluto, but that doesn't mean the team behind the spacecraft is twiddling their thumbs. This afternoon the team, led by principle investigator Alan Stern, released this wild exaggerated-color image of Pluto and its largest moon, Charon. It's a much different look from the first clear color view of Pluto we received this morning. That amazing image was taken by New Horizons' Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), but it was colorized with data from Ralph, another one of the spacecraft's cameras. The new images shed a new colorful light on Pluto and Charon Ralph, which can take images in visible and infrared light, has a wider field of view than LORRI, so New Horizons had to get close to Pluto before the camera could resolve any usable detail. These new images, which are about the resolution we saw LORRI capture last week, were taken at 3:38AM ET on July 13th. The team received them on the ground later in the day at 12:25PM ET, and their arrival prompted this cryptic tweet from New Horizons team scientist Kimberly Ennico Smith:   Wow^wow  The image was first made by taking a picture with each of the the three color filters (red, blue, and green) found on the Ralph camera. Those images were then combined and the resulting colors were enhanced. This process lets the team get a more detailed view of surface features — the false colors help scientists understand the boundaries of different geological regions. Take the ""heart"" on Pluto, for example. In this morning's image it looks like one large homogenous region. In the exaggerated-color image, however, you can see a distinct split between the left and right sides. The false-color image suggests the two sides may be composed of different material. User ""ZLD"" has morphed the MVIC color image onto the LORRI grayscale image: http://t.co/XdbCFvuD1W pic.twitter.com/kALp2zgRwX  The feature that stands out most in the new images of Charon is the polar dark spot. While this was visible in many of the black-and-white LORRI images, we can see here that it's tinted red, which hints at the presence of organic hydrocarbons. But how did those hydrocarbons get there? The leading theory from the New Horizons team is that material from Pluto escaped the dwarf planet and was sucked onto Charon’s pole. We’ll find out whether that idea is right in the coming weeks and months, as New Horizons sends more data back.",0.8837720353309918,0.1162279646690082,0.19567482960152535,422,4.9312796208530809,256,5.80859375,1,0,"Science, Transportation, Space"

The seats look plasticky, the storage space at the front of the car is basically a bucket, and the floor appears to be designed to be wiped clean.

But wearables sit at the intersection of fashion and tech, and sometimes their yearly changes look more like the former than the latter. And that's okay. This year it's Garmin with the Vivofit 2, a small update to last year's model that adds a backlight and a few other improvements but keeps the year-long battery life and always-on display. The company has tapped Jonathan Adler to design a few interchangeable bands. They're still bulky receptacles for the Vivofit module, but they at least look like they're meant to be seen instead of hidden.

Lepow, creator of the HiSmart Pack, has another idea: what if the bag itself could sync with your phone? The HiSmart Pack is a combination backpack and messenger bag, with a waterproof canvas body and a leather strap. The real draw, though, is the metal wheel embedded in that strap, which acts as a simple control system for your phone. If you connect via Bluetooth and plug a microphone into the connected jack, your bag will vibrate when you get a phone call, and you can answer it by pressing a button. The version on display at CES wasn't much more complex than that. But Lepow is announcing an Indiegogo campaign later this year for a second prototype, which will sell for $299 and includes a fuller feature set. Besides letting you answer the phone, you'll be able to play and pause music, as well as do some very basic mapping. If the bag gets too far from your phone, it can buzz to remind you, and pressing a button will drop a pin on Google Maps, so you can do something like mark the place you left your car and then look for it using a mobile app. Granted, you can find trackers implanted in virtually any accessory at CES, and the HiSmart Bag isn't a wonder of design. It's got 17 convenient pockets all over it, you can flip a few pieces around to turn it from a long-strapped messenger bag to a short-strapped backpack, and the electronics are tastefully low-key — you might not even notice them from a distance. But the nearly unadorned canvas looks a little too shiny and austere, and the black plastic fasteners on the brown bag don't look nearly as nice as the brushed metal on the black one. Lepow, though, has put welcome effort into making the bag modular and upgradable. The controller and headphone jack will be removable, so you can remove them to swap in a new unit in the future, or even take the strap padding off and use it on something else. A wireless bag shouldn't be on anybody's must-buy list right now, but Lepow is taking a good, simple idea and running with it.

The numbers have gotten so big that they increasingly can't be matched by the public markets when these companies decide to IPO. How did things get so out of wack? According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, a big part of the problem is that startups are increasingly inflating or inventing the financial success they tout to investors and the press. The article looked at 50 tech startups that went public, and compared the numbers before and after public disclosure to the SEC. Fifteen of the companies had sales figures that were far lower, a total of $760 million that simply vanished once these firms were subjected to more skeptical accounting. Rubicon Project Inc, for example, said in 2010 that it had over $100 million in revenue and was profitable and growing. Its IPO last year revealed it actually made less than $40 million a year in 2011 and, far from profiting, lost $15.4 million. ""No one is really checking the numbers."" For private startups with large valuations, the other option for an exit is to be acquired. When they get bought by a public company, the truth about their financials can also be revealed. Twitter, for example, acquired the ad-tech company MoPub. In May of 2013 the company's CEO, Jim Payne, had written in a blog post that the company was on pace to generate $100 million in revenue that year. Subsequent filings from Twitter show that in fact, MoPub generated just $6.5 million during the first half of 2013. A spokesman at Twitter says the discrepancy at MoPub largely reflects the difference between gross revenue and net revenue. Asked about the discrepancy between what he said before being acquired by Twitter and what was revealed afterwards, Payne gave the Journal a remarkably candid answer.

These days the technology known as Bitcoin is a hot topic among the digerati of Silicon Valley and barons of Wall Street. But years before Bitcoin was a global phenomenon and the subject of financial speculation, it was a piece of open-source software that was struggling to attract more than a handful of users.      In the spring of 2009, the Bitcoin software had been up and running for a few months since being launched by a shadowy creator named Satoshi Nakamoto. The software gave out free bitcoins to anyone who downloaded and ran the software, to encourage new participants, but almost no one seemed interested — after all, what would someone do with the free bitcoins?     An unlikely savior Satoshi Nakamoto stuck around cryptography forums and an incipient Bitcoin message board, responding with excitement to anyone who expressed interest — but almost no one was there. It was, at this point, that the technology got its savior from an unlikely place: a small dorm room in Helsinki. When Martti Malmi found Bitcoin in the spring of 2009, he was in his second year at the Helsinki University of Technology. Lanky, with birdlike features, Martti shied away from social contact. He was happiest in his room with his computer, writing code, which he had learned to do at age 12, or hammering away at enemies in online games, while listening to heavy metal music on headphones. A libertarian-leaning lone wolf Martti’s reclusive, computer-centric life led him to the ideas behind Bitcoin, and ultimately to Bitcoin itself. The internet had allowed a teenage Martti to discover and explore political ideas that were far from the Finnish social democratic consensus. He began following the ideas of the libertarian economists, which encouraged people to create their own destiny, aligned with Martti’s lone-wolf approach to life. Who needs the state when you have talent and ideas? During his college years, Martti had become fascinated by the rise in Scandinavia of the Pirate Party, which promoted technology over political engagement as the way to move society. Napster and other music-sharing services hadn’t waited for politics to reform copyright law; they forced the world to change. As Martti pondered these ideas, he began wondering whether money might be the next thing vulnerable to technological disruption. After a brief spasm of random web searches, Martti had found his way to the primitive website at Bitcoin.org. ""I would like to help with Bitcoin."" In his first email to Satoshi Nakamoto, in May 2009, Martti had offered his services: ""I would like to help with Bitcoin, if there’s something I can do,"" he wrote. Before reaching out to Satoshi, Martti had written about Bitcoin on anti-state.org, a forum dedicated to the possibility of an anarchist society organized only by the market. Using the screen name Trickster, Martti gave a brief description of the Bitcoin idea and asked for thoughts: ""What do you think about this? I’m really excited about the thought of something practical that could truly bring us closer to freedom in our lifetime :-)"" Martti included a link to this post in his first email to Satoshi, and Satoshi quickly read it and responded. ""Your understanding of Bitcoin is spot on,"" Satoshi wrote back. A primer to explain Bitcoin to the world Satoshi quickly gave Martti practical suggestions for how he could help the project. The most important was the simplest: to leave his computer on with the Bitcoin program running. Five months after Bitcoin was launched, it was still not possible to trust that someone somewhere was running the Bitcoin program. As to the more complicated programming needs, Satoshi told Martti that there was ""not much that’s easy right now."" But, Satoshi added, the Bitcoin website did need introductory material for beginners and Martti seemed like the right person for the job. ""My writing is not that great — I am a much better coder,"" Satoshi wrote, encouraging Martti to try his hand. Two days later, Martti proved Satoshi right by sending a lengthy but accessible document addressing seven basic questions, ready to be posted on the Bitcoin website. Martti provided straightforward, if occasionally stilted, answers to questions like, ""Is Bitcoin safe?"" and ""Why should I use Bitcoin?""  Satoshi liked the document so much that Martti was quickly given full credentials for the Bitcoin website, allowing him to make any improvements he wanted. Within a few weeks of his initial exchanges with Satoshi, Martti had totally revamped the Bitcoin website. The onslaught of new users was slow to arrive, however. A few dozen people downloaded the Bitcoin program in June, to add to the few hundred who had downloaded it since its original release. Most had tried it once and then turned it off. But Martti kept at it. After releasing the new website, Martti turned to the software’s actual underlying code. He did not know C++, the programming language that Satoshi had written Bitcoin in, so Martti began teaching himself. Working day and night Martti had time for all of this because he failed to land a summer programming job — a failure that gave Bitcoin a much needed boost over the next months. Martti got a part-time job through a temp agency, but he would spend many of his days and nights at the university computer lab and find himself emerging at dawn. He and Satoshi communicated regularly and fell into an easy rapport. While Satoshi never discussed anything personal in these emails, he would banter with Martti about little things. In one email, Satoshi pointed to a recent exchange on the Bitcoin email list in which a user referred to bitcoin as a ""cryptocurrency,"" a neologism inspired by the cryptographic functions that made it run. ""Maybe it’s a word we should use when describing bitcoin. Do you like it?"" Satoshi asked. They also batted potential improvements to the software back and forth. Martti proposed making Bitcoin launch automatically when someone turned on a computer, an easy way to get more nodes on the network. New strategies for expanding the network of miners Satoshi loved it: ""Now that I think about it, you’ve put your finger on the most important missing feature right now that would make an order of magnitude difference in the number of nodes."" Despite Martti’s relative lack of programming experience, Satoshi gave him full permission to make changes to the core Bitcoin software on the server where it was stored—something that, to this point, only Satoshi could do. Starting in August, the log of changes to the software showed that Martti was now the main actor. When the next version of Bitcoin, 0.2, was released, Satoshi gave credit for most of the improvements to Martti. At about the same time, Martti set up an online forum where the small but growing group of people attracted to the technology could communicate. Martti was given credit for improvements to Bitcoin itself The Bitcoin forum went online in the fall of 2009 and soon attracted a few regulars. One of them, who called himself NewLibertyStandard, talked about the need for a website where people could buy and sell bitcoins for real money. Martti had been talking with Satoshi about something similar, but he was eager to help NewLibertyStandard. In the very first recorded transaction of bitcoin for United States dollars, Martti sent NewLibertyStandard 5,050 bitcoins to use for seeding the new exchange. In return, Martti got $5.02 by PayPal. It would still be almost a year before Bitcoin would attract even a moderate following, but Martti Malmi had already proven that bitcoins could be worth real money, and he would help it prove that it could do much more than that. The cryptocurrency has now spawned hundreds of startups, raked in hundreds of millions in venture funding, and made its way from an outsider idea to the boardrooms of nearly every major bank and stock exchange in the world. Martti has continued to be interested in disruptive finance; he now works for MONI, a stealth startup building a bridge between the old and new worlds of financial services. And those bitcoins for which Martti received $5.02? They would be worth roughly $1,196,850 today.

Costolo told the staff today he would be stepping down in the next few weeks. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey will be interim CEO while the board conducts a search for a permanent replacement. Costolo's future at the company had been in question for the past six months as anemic user growth and a struggling stock price have led some investors to call for a change.

At a conference call later in the day, Costolo said he had begun thinking about leaving the company at the end of last year. The move came as a shock to the company's employees, who generally liked and respected Costolo as a leader. ""I'm in tears over here,"" one employee told The Verge. And it comes just a few weeks after Costolo appeared at the Code Conference to tell attendees that he and Twitter's board shared a vision for the company's future and were marching in lockstep. ""The board and I are completely in sync,"" he said. ""Believe me, I don't worry about that at all.""

Asked about a potential sale on the conference call, Costolo left the door open. ""We're obviously fully committed to maximizing value for shareholders,"" he said. ""We see no reason we can't continue to do that as an independent company. Of course, the board understands its fiduciary duty and would carefully evaluate any offer. But the focus right now is on maximizing Twitter's value ... as an independent public company."" ""There is no one better than Jack Dorsey to lead Twitter during this transition."" ""I’m particularly excited about the product work that we’ll unveil this fall,"" said Costolo in an email to employees obtained by The Wall Street Journal. Costolo, who had been hired as the company's chief operating officer, became CEO in October 2010. He replaced Twitter co-founder Ev Williams, who in turn had replaced Dorsey. ""We	have	an	exciting	lineup	of	products	and	initiatives coming to	market,	and	I	look	forward	to	continuing	to	execute	our	strategy while	helping facilitate	a	smooth	transition	as	the	Board	conducts	its	search,"" Dorsey said in a statement. Costolo oversaw a period of tremendous expansion at Twitter, leading it to hundreds of millions of users and a successful initial public offering of its stock. But he was plagued by external doubts that the company would ever reach a scale comparable to Facebook, which now has well over 1 billion monthly active users. In an effort to acquire more users, Costolo replaced his head of product twice in the year after its IPO. Its current head of product, Kevin Weil, has notably accelerated the pace of releases from the company, improving morale within the product organization and giving a sense of velocity to the company that makes Costolo's abrupt departure all the more surprising. pic.twitter.com/yJZLYFq9lP Earlier this month, early Twitter investor Chris Sacca posted a long essay on his website calling for a raft of changes to Twitter's product, putting additional pressure on the company. But during the all-hands meeting today, Twitter board member Peter Fenton said ""it wasn't Chris Sacca who made this happen,"" according to someone who was present. ""This transition is not the result of anything more than Dick deciding to move on from his role as CEO,"" Dorsey said on the conference call. A number of fascinating Twitter dramas are now about to unfold, none more interesting than Dorsey's interim return to power. As documented in Nick Bilton's essential book about the company's early days, Hatching Twitter, Dorsey has maintained a strong emotional connection to the company since he first had the idea for a lightweight way to share status messages with friends. Dorsey is now CEO of Square, and it remains to be seen how he will divide his time — and whether he will indeed relinquish the top job at Twitter to someone else.

She often steals my phone when it's time to watch the Oscars or Grammys. ""Facebook sucks at that kind of live stuff,"" she concluded. Her experience neatly captures the struggles, and opportunities, the newly departed CEO Dick Costolo grappled with since he took the company public. Twitter occupies a central place in the worlds of sports, entertainment, and news. When it comes to the real-time conversation around major events at global scale, it has no peer. Many companies would be thrilled with 300 million users and $1.4 billion in annual revenue. But on Costolo's watch, the company failed to translate that success into a narrative that can meet Wall Street's expectations or a product that connected with a mainstream audience. In the paperwork it filed with the SEC before its IPO, Twitter laid out the four attributes it believed would differentiate it from the competition: public, real time, conversational, and distributed. During protests in Ferguson, presidential primaries, or the NBA Finals, the dialogue on Twitter is intoxicating, because the central participants in the action are easy to follow, and the dialogue can flow back and forth with observers — retweeted, amplified, and spread around the world at the speed of thought. Public, real time, conversational, and distributed But that same public nature has made Twitter challenging for many users. It's typically not a feed based around your family and friends, the way Facebook or Instagram is. It doesn't have a straight-forward messaging utility like WhatsApp or Snapchat, or at least it didn't have a very refined version of that until recent improvements to Direct Messages. And the open nature of the conversation has enabled harassment and abuse on a scale that most other social networks don't have to contend with. Twitter has picked up the pace of product innovation Costolo tried to address these challenges. He pushed his product team to reimagine the experience of creating a Twitter account, and of visiting Twitter when not logged in, so that new users would have an easier time finding and following interesting material. Twitter also began to move away from the strictly chronological feed, pinning the best tweets to the top so you could see what you missed while away. For my money, Twitter has improved over the last two years, but so far that hasn't moved the needle on user growth or engagement.   For all those writing about what @dickc did wrong. He took a company from $28m in revenue to $1.4bn. Step up if you've done the same.    Costolo tried to explain this dynamic to investors, calling the company a series of concentric circles. While 300 million was the hard number of engaged users it reported to the SEC, he said, there was a second, much larger number that regularly visited Twitter to consume content without logging in. Beyond that was an even more massive number of people that saw tweets when they were embedded in articles or referenced on television, who understood that news and gossip and activism happened on there, but didn't touch the actual service on a regular basis. Investors aren't buying Twitter's new narrative about size Investors didn't buy it.  Twitter was constantly compared to Facebook, though it failed to grow at Facebook's speed or build a business quite as profitable. Twitter arguably has an equal or greater impact on current events and the global discourse, but many of the people who read tweets aren't counted as active users and are therefore difficult to monetize. While Twitter didn't have the rapidly expanding audience that investors had hoped for, its revenue growth exceeded expectations during most of Costolo's tenure as CEO of the public company. This was his saving grace, until it wasn't. ""Dick Costolo deserves credit for stabilizing Twitter when he joined as COO in 2009 and took over as CEO in 2010, and leading the company to an IPO and beyond,"" says tech analyst Ben Thompson. ""Since the IPO, however, Costolo has lost credibility with Wall Street, particularly after last quarter’s results that added slowing revenue growth to existing concerns about slowing user growth. Lost credibility simply can’t be recovered from, particularly for a non-founder CEO."" Twitter is bringing Jack Dorsey, a founder and former CEO, back as its interim chief executive. Some very close observers of the company, like StockTwits founder Howard Lindzon, argue that this change makes little sense. Dorsey isn't well known for creating mass market products or profitable businesses. People are dumb. Twitter is not a turnaround. It's a highly pressured overvalued startup. It's everyone's fault.  Twitter doesn't need a turnaround so much as a new set of expectations. There have been persistent rumors that Google is eyeing Twitter for a takeover bid. Part of me hopes that this happens. The combination could be just the thing the search giant needs to finally grab a meaningful foothold in the world of social media, while giving Twitter the shelter it needs to play to its strengths and avoid the battering that comes with round after round of poorly received quarterly earnings.",0.4911366818242342,0.5088633181757658,0.21243936371682728,928,5.0625,523,6.1644359464627154,1,0,"Business, Tech, Report"

TrackingPoint had a stunning product. Launched in 2011, the startup was a gun manufacturer building rifles designed to nail targets at extreme distances, even when it was an amateur staring down the scope. In an industry dominated by American companies nearly as old as the country itself, TrackingPoint seemed poised to be the one to change the game. The firearms brought the company media notoriety — good and bad — but some people at the gun maker wanted more. That desire manifested as the BRS, or barrel reference system, a laser-guided attachment built to ensure guns met “lifetime zero,” never straying from flawless, factory-set aim.       According to former employees, the system was a mess. The device could cause more trouble than it was worth, and engineers were spending as much time putting together the BRS as all the other parts of a rifle combined. Worse, if the BRS wasn’t working, you couldn’t fire the gun at all. ""Something spectacular would’ve had to have happened for us to survive that.""  But John McHale, the mercurial entrepreneur behind TrackingPoint, had already made his bet on the BRS. After the company’s CEO ditched the system, according to a former engineer, McHale replaced him with someone else, despite the fact he was widely admired by employees. ""Something spectacular would’ve had to have happened for us to survive that,"" the former employee says.   In public, TrackingPoint always put a smiling face on its prospects, while internally, the company’s situation looked increasingly dire. As the company made stratospheric predictions about its future, forecasting growth and earning fame with media tours and demos, former employees say they dealt with long hours, hostile work conditions, and broken promises, often before losing their jobs entirely. With virtually every employee gone, TrackingPoint is now nearly finished, but for a moment, it looked, to anyone watching, like the company was devising a plan for a brave new world from a Texas office. TrackingPoint’s origin story is nearly unverifiable, a disruption tale bordering on the mystical, but according to company lore, it goes something like this: McHale was hunting gazelle when he missed a 300-yard shot, an event that jolted him with an epiphany. He would create a new gun, put ""fighter jet technology in a firearm,"" and change the industry. Already wealthy from early bets on the telecom and internet industries, McHale certainly had the means to fund a new venture. He assembled experts from across disciplines to create his new machine, and began developing the ""precision-guided firearm"" — the gun that couldn’t miss. McHale, according to former employees, wanted to bring the first weapon to market as quickly as possible. To ensure that happened, he made a deal with TrackingPoint staff in the summer of 2012. The terms of the agreement were simple: 10-10-10. If employees could produce 10 rifle scopes in 10 weeks, they’d earn a $10,000 bonus. The goal was ambitious, to put it lightly. Engineers on the team scrambled to make the deadline, as some worked 12 or 14 hours a day, seven days a week. ""At one point we did a 26-hour straight shift, and that wasn’t entirely uncommon,"" a former employee says. But they still fell short of the goal and missed the bonus windfall. ""The mood in the office was so bitter."" Well-intentioned or not, after the team missed the deadline, executives at the company put together a transportable ""summer vacation"": floaties and palm tree decorations in the office. Some at the company felt that was tone-deaf, as if management was saying, according to the employee, ""But look at all this fun stuff we did for you! Look how fun the conference room looks!"" Employees say they often weren’t compensated for working extra hours. ""At one point we did a 26-hour straight shift, and that wasn’t entirely uncommon."" Still, by early 2013, TrackingPoint was a hit, at least in the media. The company’s first gun was certainly quite a sight: a coal-black, Wi-Fi-enabled, video-streaming, severely precise rifle. You simply ""tagged"" a target from wherever you were, and the gun would deliver the target a bullet from about 1,000 yards away, even if it was on the move. Reports straddled the line between awestruck and abjectly terrified. An impressive technical feat, sure, but what would happen when the rifle got into the wrong hands? Was selling a gun like this to the public a wise move? McHale would brush off the ethical implications, saying the price — thousands of dollars — would be a barrier to entry. By May, the company was shipping out its first ""precision-guided firearms,"" with no less an attendee than Texas governor Rick Perry present for the launch event. And at his Mason, Texas ranch, according to sources present, McHale announced that he would be stepping down as CEO to become chairman of the company, passing the executive torch to an ex-marine at TrackingPoint named Jason Schauble. ceo jason schauble was literally a war hero Schauble was literally a war hero, awarded medals for, among other acts, suffering major wounds in Fallujah while trying to save a comrade. He presided over the company as it garnered more media attention and expanded production of its weapons, launching a plan for a ""super gun"" that could hit a target from 3,100 yards away, a goal that would eventually be scaled back. Plus, Schauble had come from Remington, which meant he had valuable connections to a major player in the firearms industry that might acquire the smaller TrackingPoint. ""Everybody liked him,"" one former employee says. There was one other good reason to like him: ""Schauble was the one guy who could tell McHale ‘no’ — to an extent,"" another employee says.  That could lead to tension between the two personalities. More than a moneyed financier, McHale had run tech companies before, and seemed intent on working directly on the guns. He would make changes, often disrupting production, according to former employees. When he was displeased, the TrackingPoint team knew it. ""The guy would kick a hole in the wall,"" one former employee says. When someone said they could fix it, McHale stopped them: ""That’ll remind people not to piss me off."" Eventually, a former employee says, Schauble was caught in ""a yelling match"" with McHale over the BRS, and in November of 2013, he was fired. That month, despite millions from outside funding and McHale’s deep pockets, TrackingPoint laid off more employees. A company spokesperson gave a statement about Schauble; the TrackingPoint board ""felt there needed to be a change in direction."" ""Basically,"" one former employee says, ""because he told John McHale the truth."" The news wasn’t all bad. Employees were getting stock and were still looking forward to the day they could cash out. An acquisition by a larger company would be nice, but firing Schauble may have put any deal with Remington, which some presumed to be the candidate, in jeopardy. employees were looking forward to cashing out Meanwhile, another old hand at TrackingPoint, John Lupher, replaced Schauble, and the company still seemed solid. (Lupher wasn’t a bad guy, employees say, although he was more of ""a yes man"" than Schauble. He declined to comment for this story.) ""One amazing thing about the company is that it collected the best talent in the industry — of any industry,"" according to one employee. Another called the team ""bleeding-edge intelligent."" Moreover, the company was producing options for customers. At the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show, the company unveiled a new line of rifles, starting at $9,995. ""We expect not only strong demand for the 500 Series AR products, but also a growing demand for our technology across the industry,"" Lupher said in a company press release. In January of 2014, the military reportedly bought six rifles for testing.     That year, the company, which now had both a retired admiral from the US Special Operations Command and a retired US Marine Corps colonel on its board, announced that it received more than $29 million in funding. Total outside funding, according to the company, was $64 million. (McHale Labs, which a source says is McHale’s funding arm, was reportedly one of the leading investors.) Lupher told The Wall Street Journal in June that the company was worth more than $250 million. But some were concerned about TrackingPoint’s business plan. If hunting was a sport, surely precision guidance was cheating, akin to taking cues from computer chess and calling yourself a grandmaster. ""Real hunters — guys that love hunting and spend their time hunting — they hated TrackingPoint,"" a former employee says. They could sell to the military — an option that might present less ethical baggage — but would they bite? The company did score a deal with Remington, which was looking to partner with TrackingPoint on a project called Remington 2020. TrackingPoint produced the scopes for a new series of precision-guided rifles, but according to sources close to the project, it turned into a fiasco. The scopes shipped while still plagued by problems. ""They were basically tagging a very high percentage of these things as having manufacturing defects, and a vice president said, ‘Ship it anyway,’"" a source says, estimating that out of every 100 scopes shipped, about 40 were flagged by Remington as problematic. The scopes, it was rumored, did not connect with customers, either. And the hammer kept falling. Lupher was fired in December, apparently following a row over the direction of the business. Another CEO, Frank Bruno, soon took over. ""We were promised more communication, but it went dead silent for five more weeks,"" a source there at the time says. ""We were promised more communication, but it went dead silent for five more weeks."" There are two stories about what happened next: the public and the private. On February 24th, 2015, the company put out a press release trumpeting ""exponential growth for 2014."" TrackingPoint, according to the release, was soaring. ""Year-on-year unit growth was 281 percent and year-on-year bookings dollars grew 107 percent,"" the release said. The company made the astonishing claim that not only was the company growing, but that it was perhaps ""the fastest-growing gun company in the world."" The company said the Department of Defense was also interested in buying its weapons. It was only buried in the release that the company announced ""an internal restructuring to ensure and accelerate future growth."" Bruno is quoted in the release: ""With new markets opening up and growing interest in our products, our company needs to focus on operational excellence."" On the inside, that ""restructuring"" meant major layoffs at the company. Far from feeling like a streamlining move, it seemed to employees like TrackingPoint was suddenly in disarray. The research and development team was slashed. ""That was a massive one,"" a former employee says. The staff — up to a maybe a hundred or so at the company’s peak — had been winnowed down to less than 50. With TrackingPoint’s employees still shaken by layoffs, the company cut most of its remaining staff last month, down to a tiny crew. The company posted a note on its website: ""Due to financial difficulty TrackingPoint will no longer be accepting orders. Thank you to our customers and loyal followers for sharing in our vision."" What are the company’s plans? It’s unclear. McHale, in a brief phone interview last week, said there were still employees at TrackingPoint, but would not say how many or whether the company was broke. But TrackingPoint, according to former employees, is essentially dead, operating with a ""skeleton crew,"" there to document the company’s intellectual property before a sale. Where that valuable — and potentially dangerous — information will go is also unclear. Employees The Verge spoke with were angered over the stock they were given. Many took options, hoping it would pay off eventually, but the stock was restricted. As it became clear the company wouldn’t be finding a buyer, and as the layoffs came, it dawned on many that the stock would never have any value. Employees The Verge spoke with were angered over the stock they were given But despite TrackingPoint’s failure, the allure of a perfect gun might be too powerful an idea for someone — McHale, the military, or otherwise — to shy away from. DARPA, for example, has been developing self-guiding bullets. And even as TrackingPoint has sunk, it may not have left the earth without some kind of legacy. A talk scheduled for the Black Hat hacking conference in August will be about TrackingPoint.

Leonhart quickly contradicted those views in a speech to a sheriffs' association. A few months later, another wave of states voted to legalize marijuana for recreational use. Leonhart resigned in May, leaving in the wake of a poorly handled sex scandal and criticism regarding her stance on legalization.

Tomorrow, President Obama will reveal the final rules, with targets that are even more aggressive than the draft regulations. The new regulations focus on limiting carbon pollution from power plants across America. Specifically, the 600-plus, coal-fired power plants across the country are targeted by the regulations — it's said that the new policies will shut down hundreds of such plants, which are among the largest producers of greenhouse gases. The regulations are also designed to halt the production of new coal power plants, and will encourage the development of power plants based on renewable sources.  BREAKING: On Monday, President Obama will release the final version of America's Clean Power Plan—the biggest, most important step we've ever taken to combat climate change. If you agree that we can't condemn our kids and grandkids to a planet that's beyond fixing, share this video with your friends and family. It's time to #ActOnClimate. The White House published a video on Facebook to announce the news and, Obama hopes, spread the word. In it, Obama calls the new rules ""the biggest, most important step we've ever taken to combat climate change,"" and he proclaims that ""climate change is not a problem for another generation, not anymore."" Obama will make an official announcement tomorrow from the White House.  ""The biggest, most important step we've ever taken to combat climate change."" In the video, Obama focuses on the real, present effects of climate change, as well as the cost of not taking action. He notes that temperatures have already risen, and mentions that there are other noticeable effects already, like increased asthma issues. Compared to the plan released in 2014, the final rules are more stringent. For instance, they no longer support letting states switch from coal to natural gas plants to cut back on emissions, reports The New York Times. They also call on states to cut their emissions by 32 percent from the levels set in 2005. That's two percentage points more than the draft regulations. Rules target a 32 percent drop from 2005 levels States have until 2030 to reach those levels, and the Environmental Protection Agency is expecting states to submit plans by 2018. An initial version of those plans is due next year. The new rules do move the deadline for the first emission reductions to 2022, from 2020, according to The Hill. But that push back is designed to discourage states from quickly moving over to natural gas to make up for the shortfall from closed coal plants. One core part of the rules is that it seeks to generate a so-called cap-and-trade system with carbon credits. States that come in under the limit will essentially be able to trade their excess pollution allowance to states that are behind or otherwise are not complying with the rules. There will be an open market for such carbon credits; meaning that there will be a financial incentive for transitioning to renewable energy sources. It's important to note, however, that states will be able to choose how to comply with the new rules. They won't be forced to use a cap-and-trade system, though the federal government will give benefits to those that do. Despite the strict new goals (by US standards, at least), these changes alone are not expected to be sufficient to make a meaningful push against climate change around the world. Nations like China and India, in particular, will need to make major changes for that to happen — the US alone represents a far smaller amount of the world's total carbon footprint. That said, the new regulations should give Obama and the US better footing to push for changes worldwide. If it works out, Obama also hopes the rules, like the Affordable Care Act, will become an enduring part of his legacy once he leaves the oval office in less than two years' time.",0.4624821665907547,0.5375178334092453,0.8527739965641211,676,4.9822485207100593,363,5.9476584022038566,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World"

Hulu signed up with Epix instead (Amazon Video already has a deal), and Netflix’s attempt to soften the blow — ""Hey guys, we’ve got new Adam Sandler and Pee-wee Herman movies coming!"" — was met with swift and merciless ridicule. Behind all the sturm and drang is a basic truth: consumers want a single subscription service that can offer all the movies and TV shows they could possibly want, all in one place. Conditioned by years of streaming music services, audiences simply expect a Spotify-style service to become a reality, and anything that veers away from that goal is seen as a momentous failure. There’s just one problem: a Spotify for movies and TV is never going to happen. And that’s just the way the studios and services want it. Collecting all the content was never the point When Netflix first got into the streaming game, it wasn’t even a matter of collecting all the content; it was a question of collecting enough content to justify the service’s own existence. A lot of those movies came from side deals with cable channels: rather than getting movies from studios directly, Netflix could sub-license from channels like Starz (or Epix), and let those catalogs flow into its own online library. There tended to be some quality issues back in the day — Starz was particularly notorious for serving up pan-and-scan versions of movies — but it was a quick way to build a catalog when Netflix was best known for mailing out plastic discs. It also came with some pretty major downsides, like when Starz realized just how much value it gave to Netflix, and ended up pulling out of negotiations in 2011. At the time, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings estimated that Starz content accounted for 8 percent of Netflix’s domestic viewing, and his company’s stock plunged appropriately. Epix pulled a similar move in 2012, when it decided to not move forward with Netflix on an exclusive basis, and instead began working with Amazon as well.   For consumers, the Epix / Amazon deal was a great step — more places to find your favorite movies. But for a company like Netflix, non-exclusive content is far less valuable. When a movie is available everywhere, it becomes a commodity instead of a differentiator, moving the competition to less quantifiable terrain such as value and quality of service. Get in the ring with someone like Amazon, which uses its streaming service as a value-add rather than a revenue generator, and you’re talking about asymmetrical warfare. Given that television also offers a higher chance of sustained viewership than movies — we’ve all binged a season of a favorite show, but nobody really sits down to binge all of Will Ferrell’s movies — Netflix’s decision to not renew with Epix starts looking like a sound strategic decision. Not renewing the Epix deal starts looking like a sound strategic decision The exclusivity war is at its fiercest in the world of TV, where, it’s become the focal point. Amazon in particular has been on a tear since 2013, locking down shows like Justified, Under the Dome, and Orphan Black. In fact, Amazon feels so strongly about exclusivity that it gave up Doctor Who earlier this year rather than agree to a deal that would have let other services have the show at the same time. The newly reinvigorated Hulu has been making headlines almost entirely around its exclusive deals, keeping everything from Seinfeld to Fear the Walking Dead out of the hands of its competitors. And none of this is touching on the original shows and movies that all of the services are producing themselves — essentially the most exclusive content imaginable. The objective is to make sure you never search at all On one hand, it’s tempting to look at this scenario as a temporary moment; a transitional period between different eras of media that will eventually give way to the kind of service consumers really want. But if that’s the case, there’s no sign any of the parties involved are actually trying to make that happen. On the product side, Netflix has been laser-focused on creating a singular user experience across all devices, with one goal in mind: keep audiences watching. From its recommendation algorithms to its auto-play features, the objective isn’t to make sure you find what you want when you search — it’s to make sure you never search at all. Once the exclusive content lures you in (and when Netflix’s Disney deal kicks off in 2016, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars will do a lot of luring), you can just sit back and enjoy a custom-curated stream; the lean-back passivity of television reasserting its claim over the theoretical choice of digital. The streaming companies are content to jockey for exclusive contracts, but the media companies want it that way too: for them, there’s real benefit in keeping their wares spread out across multiple services. Hollywood learned the lessons of the music industry well, and while record labels rushed into digital arms, seeking salvation, the rest of the entertainment industry has been patient and cautious in both preventing piracy (the tyranny of HDCP) and keeping any one single player from gaining too much power (sorry, Apple). Netflix’s rapid success essentially encouraged studios to breathe life into its competitors, and as long as those fears exist, it’s unlikely the dynamic will shift. Hollywood learned from the music industry's mistakes So instead of the versatile, open future that once seemed so possible, we’re instead looking at a fragmented landscape that looks a lot more like cable television: you can get some of the shows you want from one service, but you need all of the services to get all of the shows. Given the complexities involved, the only foreseeable way consumers could get what they actually want is for some sort of massive, dystopian merger to take place, or for a single service to achieve such incredible popularity and success out of left field that it assumes de facto monopoly status. Although I suppose the entertainment companies could all get together, hash everything out, and build one master service to rule them all. Yeah.

Where Drake responds to Meek Mill with a trio of carefully calibrated diss tracks that belittled his rap skills, his relationship, and his entire being, prolific British grime artist JME uses something else in his latest diss track — Pokémon cards. ""The Very Best"" is rapper and producer JME's response to complaints about his latest video. The track samples the Pokémon cartoon theme tune, and stars an anime-styled version of the artist dressed like Pokémon master and star of the cartoon Ash Ketchum, spitting bars about shiny Charizards and master balls. It could be a joke song, but there's fire in the animated JME's eyes as he reiterates his contributions to grime, taking the time to chastise new MCs who weren't around at the time of the original 151 Pokémon.  JME and his brother, Skepta, have been influential in the rise and recent resurgence of grime, having founded London-based record label Boy Better Know in 2005. JME released grime classic ""Serious"" soon after, and came back to collaborate with his brother on last year's banger ""That's Not Me,"" just before Skepta released this year's grime anthem, ""Shutdown"" — for which Drake provided the intro bars. JME's long been an outspoken voice in grime, using Twitter to take swipes at BlackBerry, share his confusion about vaping, and build his own mini-meme out of pointing at things. Where a lot of grime MCs aim to look hard, JME happily raps about Pokémon, swaps his records for foil Charizard cards, and appears on stage in a full Iron Man suit. Remember this pic.twitter.com/Gvy2AprI4W  Let's hope North American artists are still watching the grime scene closely for inspiration — I for one can't wait for Drake to challenge Meek Mill to a Beyblade match, and for Kanye's Yu-Gi-Oh!-themed concept album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Trap Card.",0.7276118279001957,0.27238817209980426,0.8476380653610057,399,4.9649122807017543,254,5.8385826771653546,0,0,

I used to be skeptical of the notion. Video games can be big. They can take time to reveal their best self. I am only a couple hours into Mad Max, and if I hadn’t received the copy for review, I would be demanding a refund. Mad Max isn’t a mediocre video game, doomed by technical flaws or shoddy art design. Mad Max is beautiful, and, unlike so many better games released this year, runs spectacularly on PC, as if evidence its creators had plenty of time to polish. And unlike so many poor games released this year, Mad Max's developer took creative risks. Mad Max, you get the sense, was meant to be a big budget game with soul and something to say. Unfortunately, Mad Max, a game that is actively bland, is like a teenager with big ideas about how the world works but without the vocabulary nor confidence to express them. A half-hour is enough time to grok the game is flawed at its core. I’m surprised just how confidently this game whiffs. A year ago, my expectations for the Mad Max video game far surpassed those for Mad Max: Fury Road. The film’s director George Miller had spent the two decades prior making family-friendly movies about talking pigs and penguins while the film went through development hell. Work on Mad Max: The Video Game, began around 2009 with the involvement of Miller and Cory Barlog, a game designer best known for writing and directing God of War 2, but Barlog eventually left, and by 2014, Miller was no longer, publicly speaking, associated with the game, which at the time was and wasn’t connected to the film, depending on when and whom you asked.   Both projects sounded troubled from the limited rumors finding their way to the press, but Avalanche Studios, the developer of the video game, appeared better positioned to turn things around. Video game developers, who often operate on tight budgets and impossible deadlines, have a habit of making gold — or at least silver — from a shit deal. And Avalanche in particular had the pedigree; its most recent game, Just Cause 2, featured car combat that allows the player to grapple onto a car, shoot the driver, and steal the vehicle with a few quick button taps. You know, the trappings of Mad Max. Mad Max zigs wherever Just Cause zags. Just Cause is an open-world game that motivates the player to take risks. Cars can be driven down mountains with the player riding them like surfboards. There’s no limit to how far a car can drive, and there's plenty of ammunition and explosives for the player when they’re on foot. Mad Max drops the player in the wasteland, and punishes risk-taking and adventure. Jumping off a cliff damages the car, driving into the distance uses fuel, and keep your finger off the trigger, because ammo is sparse. Early in the game, the player learns to collect scrap, wait while the car gets repaired, and locate gas and water. I never thought I’d call a game about post-apocalyptic car battles dull, but here I am. On an arguing-at-a-cafe-over-video-game-theory level, I get it. Max’s world is a dangerous one, and the original films built tension on the sensation that these cars and the people inside them are incredibly vulnerable, relying on faulty materials and limited resources. A different game about survival might have made these work, but deep down, Mad Max wants to be an action game, and so it sends you from one mission of vehicular manslaughter to the next. Go have fun, it says, just not too much fun. Taking care of the car, like taking care of a someone else’s puppy, is charming for a few minutes until it becomes a chore. This design is creatively risky and paradoxically also smells of top-level notes from the publisher Warner Bros. WB has made a name for itself in the game space from the Batman: Arkham series, with its open-world and hand-to-hand fighting, which Mad Max imitates to poor effect. The latest Batman, Arkham Knight, was released alongside a marketing campaign that highlights the pleasure of roleplaying. Be the Batman, the posters said. In Mad Max, the developers want you to be Max, without considering the hard truth that Max's life sucks. That the game doubles down on the worst parts of this crappy existence — finding gas, repairing cars, driving long distances — is like making a Batman game in which you attend Wayne Enterprises business meetings and wax the batsuit.   Speaking of chores, the game doles them out like vegetables to unsuspecting trick-or-treaters. New locations are often introduced by action cut-scenes interspersed with playable sequences in which Max must walk around to collect items. If you’re considering a career designing games, remember to do the opposite. I don’t need to be Max while he looks for wires or a spring, I need to be Max when he’s jumping off cars and fighting mutant man things. The game begins with a wild showdown, culminating with Max pushing a chainsaw into a man’s skull, but none of this is playable. It’s the inciting incident! It’s the beginning of a vendetta! Why would the game distance the player from the most important moment? I mentioned the film, which we now know to be a blockbuster miracle, an action flick with a progressive slant that keeps its momentum by never repeating itself. Mad Max the game is none of these things. Its characters are the same old masculine tropes, its aesthetic never achieves the high-contrast glory of its cousin, and it is nothing if not repetitive. Do you like generic quests,  close-quarters combat, and large bases? Oh the architecture, how it whisks the brain into goop. Each interior is a maze, as if the builder said, ""Listen, I know we’re low on metal and food and labor, but what if we made this place a pain in the ass to get around on the off chance that Max guy shows up to kill us all."" After one such base — which I backtrack through to escape, because the fun option, jumping down the side of the building, leads to my death — I find myself staring into the wasteland, a man gone mad, much like Max: mad because the game has driven me crazy, and mad because I feel the critical obligation to keep playing, because upgrades to the car, like flames bursting from its sides, make the game a little more enjoyable. But those come after the window for returns, and frankly, I can’t recommend anybody give a couple hours of their valuable time to something built from the ground up to be a fun game that isn’t fun. I try to leave the base by climbing onto a walkway, and though it’s only 4 feet high, Max fails. This isn’t one of the designated claimable paths, I realize. So I just walk into the distance, leaving behind my car and any hope of survival.",0.21891535726992437,0.7810846427300756,0.1425148110476414,1186,4.6736930860033725,610,6.0524590163934429,1,1,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Essay"

The Verge previously confirmed details of the October launch, and Microsoft looks set to launch its Surface Pro 4, Lumia 950 / Lumia 950 XL handsets, and a new Microsoft Band in the same hardware event. Microsoft isn't revealing exactly what the mysterious hardware event is about, other than a hint at Windows 10-powered hardware. After a disappointing Microsoft event at IFA in Germany earlier this month, all eyes are now on the company to produce its own hardware and showcase the replacement to the Surface Pro 3. The main focus for Microsoft's hardware event will be the two new Lumia handsets and the Surface Pro 4. A Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL have been rumored for months, and specifications and images for both handsets have already leaked. All that's really left is to see what these handsets look like away from press renders and how they fit into Microsoft's new Windows 10 Mobile ecosystem. Surface Pro 4 won't be a drastic change Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 won't be a drastic change from the Pro 3 as the company has promised to keep the charging mechanism and overall form factor similar for businesses that have invested in accessories like the docking station. That doesn't mean Microsoft won't make big changes, though. The software giant can increase display size and resolution, while making the Surface Pro 4 thinner and lighter. Rumors have suggested Microsoft is planning Windows Hello support for the Surface Pro 4, but it's unlikely the company will fit an Intel RealSense camera into the thin device. Instead, a fingerprint scanner on an updated and refined Surface keyboard sounds more likely. More recent rumors have also pointed towards a 14-inch version of a Surface device. We previously heard whispers of an additional Surface device, so it's possible Microsoft may have a larger surprise addition to the lineup.

Jasmine, long grain, risotto, dark wild, or basmati, put it in rice No matter how faint the prospect of revival, every wet phone elicits the same folksy remedy: put in rice, my friends said. Put it in rice, my parents said, and leave it there for at least a day. Jasmine, long grain, risotto, dark wild, or basmati, put it in rice. So I did: I found an abandoned box of Uncle Ben’s, buried my phone under the grains, put it back in the pantry, and waited for the rice to work its magic. In an era of Genius Bars, man-on-robot assault, and do-it-yourself handgun drones, the so-called rice trick feels like a kernel of ancient wisdom, passed down from one generation to the next. You can almost imagine our ancestors dunking their precious, soggy goods into burlap sacks of rice long ago. But where did the rice trick come from — and does it really work? In July 2007, less than a month after the first iPhone was released, a MacRumors forum member by the name of jorsuss launched a thread called ""I dropped my iPhone in water"" with a familiar tale: ""I was checking the phone if I got any calls or messages and I dropped it in the sink."" Jorsuss covered the phone with rice in what may have been the first documented attempt to use the rice trick on an iPhone. It didn’t work, but it is proof that the method existed before the iPhone, even if the details of the technique were fuzzy — ""Is the rice supposed to be cooked or uncooked when using it to dry out a water-soaked cell phone?"" asked one user on Yahoo Answers at the time. One month earlier, in June 2007, a Washington Post reporter dropped his BlackBerry into a toilet while prepping for a date. When he saved his phone (and his date) using the rice trick, it merited a personal account in the paper along with a write-up on LifeHacker: ""Dry out your soaked gadgets in rice."" But the phone-saving tip predates the smartphone — back in 2000 at least one user used it to help him revive a Nokia 5130. ""Is the rice supposed to be cooked or uncooked?"" Keep digging and you finally get to the likely source of the trick: for many decades, rice was used to keep camera equipment and film dry in tropical locations. In 1996’s Yankee Magazine’s Make It Last: Over 1,000 Ingenious Ways to Extend the Life of Everything You Own, Earl Proulx writes, ""If you’re taking your camera to a warm, humid climate, ward off rust and fungus by putting some silica gel desiccant (available from camera shops) in a porous bag and storing it with your camera equipment and film… In a pinch, substitute uncooked rice."" In an article from a June 1946 issue of Popular Photography, the author writes that while silica is the preferred method of keeping exposed film dry, tea, brown paper, and rice can work as well, though ""their moisture capacity is so low, however, that very large quantities are required to produce a substantial effect."" (People have been questioning the power of the rice trick for at least half a century!) Photographer M. Scott Brauer, who has previously shot for The Verge, says he wasn’t aware that using rice for storing film equipment was a ""thing,"" but that he himself has done it. Another photographer who’s shot for The Verge, John Francis Peters, had never heard of that application for the rice trick but said it sounded ""quite interesting."" When the first phone was dunked into a pile of dry rice is impossible to say — but there is an ironic symmetry in the fact that we still use the method to keep our primary photography equipment safe. So, does the trick work? In 2014, Gazelle.com ran a semi-formal test that indicated it didn’t. Of the seven household desiccants they tested, uncooked rice was the least absorbent, behind cat litter, couscous, oatmeal, and instant rice. Unless you’re willing to spend serious money, leaving your phone on a shelf to air dry, they suggested, may be your best option. Craig Beinecke, co-founder of TekDry, a company that provides ""emergency electronic device rescue services"" says so too. TekDry has developed a fancy machine that resembles a suitcase bomb and uses negative pressure and low heat to actively expel fluids out of a properly doused phone in roughly 20 minutes. Last year, TekDry commissioned consulting group DTJ to conduct research into the efficacy of rice. ""In the experimental measurements, slightly more water was lost to evaporation simply by leaving the waterlogged device in an open room than by enclosing it in a container of rice,"" the study concludes. Of course that study should be taken with a grain of… salt. The research was entirely funded by a company whose business depends on the rice trick being ineffective. The rice trick endures because it sounds right, even if it isn’t Regardless of the evidence, the rice trick endures because it sounds right, even if it isn’t: rice absorbs water; absorbing water is key to saving a phone; so rice will save your phone. And every time a phone falls into a toilet or sink, the trick is transmitted anew, from parent to child, from friend to friend. Countless testimonials speak to the efficacy of rice. I have my own: I’ve personally dried my phone in rice a number of times — once, I used quinoa. It worked every time. Every time I repeat these stories, which I do freely, I contribute to the rice trick’s myth. The rice trick does have one unique and very powerful property. The worst thing you can do to a wet phone is to power it up before it dries completely — doing that is cell phone homicide in the first degree. Unlike leaving the phone on a sunny windowsill, the rice trick places the phone out of sight, and maybe out of mind. The grain may not guard the device from the destructive powers of water, but the trick does temporarily remove a much more dangerous element: us, and our impatient, tech-driven neuroses. Spending 12 hours, 24 hours, or even a few days — depending on the instructions you follow — without your phone can be hard. Having it sit in plain view makes it harder. We’re tempted to power up too soon, and kill the very thing we crave. But if we believe in the rice trick, we give it time to work its magic — time that maybe would have saved the phone with or without the rice. In effect, the rice trick only works because we believe it does. Twenty-four hours after I placed my phone into the box of rice, I pulled it out, charged it up, and hit the power button. I was stunned: the screen lit up, and asked me to re-enter my Apple ID. I did, and the entire system booted up flawlessly: the camera worked, as did the microphone and the speaker. Under the screen, I could see pockets of moisture;  eventually, most of them evaporated. Within three days, there was hardly a trace that my phone had spent a full day playing submarine. My phone should have been swimming with the fishes. But there it was, the electronic living dead. Spooky. There it was, the electronic living dead That Monday I strutted into the Verge office with my resuscitated phone like a modern-day Dr. Frankenstein, parading my very own freak of science. A whole day! At the bottom of a lake! My colleagues asked the inevitable question: Did you put it in rice? I did, I said. Of course, they said, that’s the trick, works every time. But two weeks later, my phone became sluggish, unresponsive. Then, one evening, it stopped receiving a signal entirely, the word ""Searching…"" permanently tattooed in the upper left corner of the screen. I brought it to my carrier, where a lady tried this and that, starting and restarting the device ad infinitum. After 45 minutes, she turned to me, visibly frustrated. ""Sir,"" she asked me, with a streak of suspicion in her voice, ""did you get this phone wet?""",0.4063798556116325,0.5936201443883675,0.24329344536337386,1465,4.6286689419795222,746,5.9986595174262733,0,0,"Tech, Report"

In an op-ed for the BBC, the highly opinionated Google — and soon to be Alphabet — chairman wrote that we're closer than ever before to true artificial intelligence, and that continued research into its development will have positive side effects that will benefit the public. In his piece, Schmidt notes that AI-related research hit an inflection point a few years ago, after a team led by Geoff Hinton, a leader in artificial neural networks, was able to dramatically improve on speech recognition, and helped improve Google's efforts by 25 percent, a jump that would've taken years of research. Schmidt also noted that consumer interest in technologies that could actively solve real-world issues gave way to increased research into AI: And it's been accelerated by tackling real-world problems: how do you build a system that recognizes speech in 58 languages? How do you find someone's first photo of their golden retriever when it's never been labelled? (These aren't just rhetorical questions; the Google app and Google Photos do this, and many other companies are working on similar real-world applications of machine learning). In other words, the same consumer needs that gave rise to the web and the cloud computing that powers it - people wanting to get any question in the world answered or communicate effortlessly across languages - were what refreshed and refocused the basic research in AI. Schmidt also took a veiled shot at Apple Music, as he discussed the effect of artificial intelligence research on modern music services. Schmidt said that companies should be using algorithms to determine what users want to listen to next, instead of employing a collection of tastemakers to curate music — precisely what Apple Music is doing — calling that approach ""elitist"": To give just one example: a decade ago, to launch a digital music service, you probably would have enlisted a handful of elite tastemakers to pick the hottest new music. Today, you're much better off building a smart system that can learn from the real world - what actual listeners are most likely to like next - and help you predict who and where the next Adele might be. As a bonus, it's a much less elitist taste-making process - much more democratic - allowing everyone to discover the next big star through our own collective tastes and not through the individual preferences of a select few. Taking shots at Apple is nothing new for the former Apple director — and the chair of an algorithm-driven company — and it likely won't be the last time it happens. But despite its many faults, Schmidt chose to attack one of the few things Apple Music has gotten right — curation. While there are valid arguments for both algorithm and human-driven curation in music services, with the success of both Spotify (algorithmic) and the early numbers on Apple Music, it looks like both avenues are still valid options for music services.",0.46373487932064306,0.5362651206793569,0.7941690401981453,507,4.9861932938856013,305,5.9311475409836065,0,0,"Google, Tech"

Folding DNA isn’t new — it’s known as DNA origami — but automating the process is. Thanks to a set of computer algorithms, researchers have developed a way to streamline the design phase that comes before the DNA assembly — a substantial step toward 3D printing at the nanoscale. If DNA origami were a lego project, ""base pairs"" would be the bricks If DNA origami were a lego project, ""base pairs"" — the biological units that make up the DNA double helix — would be the bricks. These units follow strict pairing rules, such that base ""A"" can only combine with base ""T"" to form a unit, whereas ""C"" can only link itself to ""G."" And when they're combined, base pairs form very predictable shapes — ones that scientists have begun to harness. This is the field of DNA nanotechnology, a field that aims to design and manufacture tiny structures made of DNA that can then be used to deliver drugs, or even to make electronics. Currently, DNA manipulation is time-consuming and costly; the new method promises to make it simpler and cheaper. That's why today's study matters. It's a solid step toward a fully automated construction method — one that wouldn't be unlike your friendly neighborhood 3D printer, except with DNA.   The design process, from start to finish. (Erik Benson and Björn Högberg) In the study, the researchers used design software to draw complex shapes in 3D, such as a bottle, a bunny, and a waving humanoid. Then, they used their specially tailored computer algorithms to plan the DNA scaffolding that would form the 3D object. So when the researchers ran their algorithms on a 3D bunny, for example, the computer spat out a list of short DNA sequences that — when combined under the right temperature conditions — would automatically assemble to form the rabbit in question. Algorithms map out the DNA sequences that will make a bunny The next step was to order the building materials — so the researchers sent their computer-generated list to a company called Integrated DNA Technologies, which specializes in manufacturing DNA from viruses. They got their supplies: small tests tubes filled with close to 200 short strands of DNA. Putting these manufactured DNA strands through warming and cooling procedures prompted them to automatically assemble, following the exact path the algorithm had determined. By the time the researchers were done, they had tiny nanoscale, rabbit-shaped DNA on their hands. ""All the DNA strands find their right place in the structure,"" says Björn Högberg, a chemical engineer at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and a co-author of the study.   A ball, a nicked torus, a rod, a helix, a waving stickman, a bottle, and a version of the Stanford bunny. (Högberg et al, 2015) ""[This] has not been done before, it is novel and surprising,"" says Thorsten Schmidt, a chemist at the Dresden University of Technology who didn't work on the study. ""In fact, we have a very related study under review at the moment and the only bad aspect of Björn Högberg’s study is that they were faster than us."" ""The only bad aspect of Björn Högberg’s study is that they were faster than us."" The bunny, while cute, wasn’t the point of the study. Rather, it’s a demonstration that scientists can automatically generate a DNA sequence to form a complex shape — the closest thing to 3D printing on a very tiny scale. ""It’s almost a one-click procedure,"" Högberg says. And if scientists can fully automate the process, they’ll have a real DNA printer at their disposal — one that could, among other things, make drugs easier to deliver to the right places in the body. Drug delivery methods and gold-covered DNA But at this point, the bunny and the bottle don't do all that much. ""We're not really concerned with the genetic information,"" Högberg says.

That approach is so efficient that animals don't survive long enough to die from asphyxiation — the method that most scientists thought was the correct ""cause of death"" in constricted prey. The finding, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, likely means that many a biology textbook will need to be revised. Until now, researchers had never actually directly tested how constrictors kill their prey. A few researchers suggested in the '80s and '90s that circulatory arrest — stopping the flow of blood — was the correct method by which constrictors killed prey. But most of the literature over the last century actually hypothesized that prey died from suffocation, says Brad Moon, a snake researcher at the University of Louisiana-Lafayette, who didn't work on the study.  Stopping the flow of blood means you can't deliver oxygen to the tissue That's why today's paper is important; it might finally put a nail in the coffin of scientists' previous, breathtaking assumption. Asphyxiation, by definition, is absence of ventilation. So when an animal gets asphyxiated, that doesn't interfere with the heart, which continues to pump. Because of that, animals continue to benefit from what little oxygen is stored in the blood, at least for a short while. ""But if you stop the flow of blood then you absolutely cannot deliver oxygen to the tissue,""  says Scott Boback, an animal ecologist at Dickinson College and a co-author of the study. So all things considered, circulatory arrest is much deadlier. Researchers used boa constrictors and rats to find out how these snakes kill their prey.  First, they inserted a number of electronic sensors inside anesthetized rats, to see what happens when a boa starts to squeeze. Vascular catheters measured the blood pressure inside the circulatory system, while electrodes measured the electrical activity of the animal's heart. The snake itself was also equipped with a device that can detect the pressure that the snake is generating around the rat. ""All of these wound together in a bunch of these wires and tubes coming out of the rat,"" Boback says. Eventually the snake would strike, and the experiment began. The rats were unconscious throughout. ""Wires and tubes coming out of the rat."" The researchers found that when boa constrictors kill a rat, they squeeze hard enough to interfere with the animal's blood pressure, blood gases, blood ion balance, and heart function. ""Constrictors stop the flow of blood in their prey, and that's causing death,"" Boback explains. ""And it's happening at a rapid pace.""     (karoH / Wikimedia Commons) The study provides a ""more detailed explanation than ever before of how constriction subdues even large and strong prey so quickly and effectively,"" Moon says. That said, Boback and his team only looked at how boa constrictors kill rats that are about 25 percent of their size, so there's still a possibility that this result is only relevant for mammals, or mammals of a certain size. That's why Boback plans to repeat the study with lizards or frogs. ""They're cold-blooded,"" he says, which means their metabolic rate is pretty low. ""​So if you have a lizard that doesn't maintain a high metabolic rate, then what's going on there? What would happen if you constricted the lizard?"" he asks. These animals don't use oxygen in the same way that mammals do, so it's possible that they don't die in quite the same way when they're squeezed. The approach helps snakes avoid severe harm from the rat's teeth and claws Inducing circulatory arrest in prey probably serves two purposes, Moon says. Because circulatory arrest seems faster than suffocation alone, killing a rat by cutting off its circulation might help the snake avoid severe harm from the rat's teeth and claws. In addition, knocking an animal out quickly likely reduces the amount of time and energy that a snake has to spend hunting and eating a single meal. Thus, a more efficient kill frees up time for mating or looking for more food. ""Those activities are less immediate than handling a current prey animal, but they're still important over the course of the snake's life,"" Moon says. For scientists, constrictor snakes have always come across as marvelous hunters. Armed with highly acute sensory abilities — they can detect prey heartbeats, for instance — they're fast and powerful predators. Still, it seems that humans may have underestimated them. Constriction is actually stronger, faster, and more effective than most researchers thought.",0.3244096117475369,0.6755903882524631,0.8489204345355695,780,5.0858974358974356,410,6.1902439024390246,1,2,"Science, Report"

The pad is currently being constructed on the Kaitorete Spit — a long finger of land located along the Canterbury region of southern New Zealand. Known for its pebbly beaches, the land is home to a diverse population of rare insects, birds, reptiles, and plants, including the endangered Shrubby tororaro. There’s not much human presence; the area is extremely remote, with no shipping ports, travel hubs, or heavily trafficked airspace nearby.  It's the perfect spot. ""If you want to launch once a week, it’s impossible to do it from the US."" The launch pad is the project of New Zealand-based Rocket Lab, a private spaceflight company founded in 2007 with a vision of sending small communication satellites into space. To put the company ahead of other satellite launchers, Rocket Lab has two distinct goals: reduce the cost of spaceflight while increasing the frequency of rocket launches to orbit. ""That's really important for the small satellite revolution to occur,"" Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck tells The Verge. This spaceport is one of the many ways Rocket Lab will try to meet those goals, by allowing the company to launch one rocket per week. ""If you want to launch once a week, it’s impossible to do it from the US,"" says Beck. ""You've got so much air traffic, so much marine traffic and shipping traffic. For our program it’s critical that we get down to a launch rate once a week. The reason the launch site is down in New Zealand is we can launch with that frequency.""   The Kaitorete Spit is a long finger of land (located at the bottom of the photo) that forms a barrier between Lake Ellesmere and the Pacific Ocean. But Rocket Lab’s vision is bigger than just a spaceport; the company made headlines earlier this year when it introduced the concept for its Rutherford engine — the first rocket engine to incorporate battery power. The design calls for lithium polymer batteries to run the engine's turbo-pumps, which help direct the propellant to where it needs to go inside the engine. It’s the first time a battery will be used to do this, and Beck says it’s thanks to advances that allow smaller batteries to pack much more horsepower. According to the CEO, the use of the battery will significantly decrease the cost of powering the turbo-pumps — often an expensive aspect of engine design. The Rutherford engine will be used in the company’s Electron rocket, which Rocket Lab will test in the fourth quarter of this year. Electron is meant to give companies a cheap option for launching small communication satellites into orbit as frequently as possible. While the engine's battery component will help to bring down these launch costs, Beck noted the company still needed a way to increase launch frequency. That's where this new spaceport will come into play. Launching small communication satellites into orbit as frequently as possible Whenever a company or space agency wishes to launch from current launch pads, regulatory agencies must issue an order restricting airspace, bridges, and waterways within 30 to 40 nautical miles of the launch site. This can be an issue for launch pads located near important travel routes. Kennedy Space Center, for example, is located near frequently-used East Coast air routes, which can make launching a rocket difficult during busy travel times like holidays. Thanks to this new launch pad's remote New Zealand location, Beck says setting up launch windows once a week won't be an issue. Currently, all launch pads used for sending rockets into orbit are operated by national government agencies. Rocket Lab had to obtain permits from New Zealand, but the spaceport is wholly overseen and operated by the company.   Rocket Lab's Electron rocket (Rocket Lab) Already, Rocket Lab has more than 30 customers signed up to launch their satellites aboard the Electron. With all the company's cost-saving measures combined, Beck says each launch will cost a mere $4.9 million. That's crazy low: the average cost of a rocket launch hovers around $130 million, with the lowest cost vehicle running for about $30 million. The only problem with the one-launch-per-week scheme? Rocket Lab's promises are all talk for now. They have yet to launch any rockets; the company's first test of the Electron rocket will occur later this year, with commercial operations planned to begin in 2016. So it remains to be seen if the company's ambitious pricing goals and launch schedules will be met. Yet many within the spaceflight industry seem optimistic about Rocket Lab’s claims. Charles Miller, president of NexGen Space LLC, a commercial spaceflight consulting agency, says that Rocket Lab’s designs seem to check out. The company's first test of the Electron rocket will occur later this year ""People who I highly respect who have looked at their technology think they may have something,"" says Miller. ""It’s a very innovative idea for reducing the cost of launch vehicles, but the proof is in the pudding; they’ve got to make it work."" Miller says the main problem, however, may revolve around finding enough business. ""There are not a lot of customers,"" says Miller. ""You never get enough business to bring down the price. Companies figure out how to build it, and there’s not enough launch rate to keep flying."" Though Miller admitted that demand for small rocket launches may grow, as the small satellite revolution continues. ""You’ve got companies like OneWeb and other companies building large constellations; that potential could be a big enough business to keep a couple companies in business.""   One of Spire Global's small satellites in development (Spire Global) One of Rocket Lab's customers is Spire Global — a satellite-powered data company backed by Bessemer Venture Partners. According to a representative from BVP, the promise of a regular launch schedule is what made Rocket Lab particularly attractive over other launch options. ""I was on the board of Skybox Imaging, the imaging satellite company Google acquired, and the number one problem was launch,"" says David Cowan, a partner at BVP. ""We could overcome all the science and technology of the project, but we were never able to control launch schedules."" Spire Global intends to launch 100 small satellites into orbit, to form a constellation that will track ships and gather weather data over the oceans. Cowan says that since Rocket Lab is focused solely on launching satellites, Spire Global will be able to get those satellites into orbit as quickly as possible. ""When you’re trying to deliver a constellation, you don’t need something that’s super performant and huge, you need something that can make frequent visits to space on a regular, reliable schedule,"" says Cowan. ""That’s a very different design goal than what you see coming from all the incumbent rocket manufacturers including SpaceX. If you want to create a steady stream of rockets into space, you want to design something very different.""",0.767511170175875,0.232488829824125,0.8513028456866579,1176,5.0544217687074831,565,6.2283185840707969,0,6,"Science, Report"

The findings, published today by the CDC, paint a gloomy picture of improper use of antibiotics in the US. Antibiotic resistance is widely considered to be among the biggest threats to humans worldwide. In the US, $21 billion are spent each year to treat resistant infections. But those treatments don't always work. Every year, antibiotic resistance in the US causes 2 million illnesses, claiming 23,000 lives. Antibiotic resistance surfaces when bacteria encounter antibiotics in their environment — a human gut, for instance — in doses that are too small to kill them. There are many reasons why that might happen; livestock farming practices that rely heavily on antibiotics are certainly to blame. But resistance can also arise when people don't finish a prescription, or when they use antibiotics that have expired and are therefore less effective. That's why assessing how people use antibiotics in the US is so important; it's a crucial step in reining in resistance. Half of health care providers think their cold-afflicted patients expect antibiotics A total of 7,546 US consumers answered an internet survey — 1,000 of which were Hispanic — in 2012 and 2013. The researchers also received answers from 1,503 health care providers. By analyzing these answers, researchers found that about 26 percent of patients expect to obtain a prescription for antibiotics when they visit the doctor for a cough or cold. And a little over half of health care providers think their cold-afflicted patients expect antibiotics. ""Provider perception of patient expectations for an antibiotic is important, because it has been shown to be a reliable predictor of overprescribing,"" the authors of the report write. In other words, if a doctor thinks antibiotics might assuage a patient's worries, they may be more likely to prescribe them — even if the drugs won't do a damn thing. Race and culture also had a large impact on antibiotic use. The researchers found that Hispanic people are three times as likely to use antibiotics without a prescription — say, by using drugs left over from a previous illness — compared with the general population. And close to half of Hispanic people think that antibiotics can help reduce cold symptoms, compared with a quarter of all survey respondents. Hispanic people were more likely take antibiotics without a prescription And although Hispanic respondents knew as much about the potential side effects of antibiotics as the entire population of respondents, they were less aware that antibiotics lose their potency over time, or that antibiotics can kill bacteria that benefit the body.     (Bmramon / Wikipedia) The report's findings weren't all bad. Over 90 percent of health care providers said that they were most commonly deterred from prescribing antibiotics because of the risk of antibiotic resistance. The authors also note that when patients visit a health care provider because of a cold, 42 percent of them did so because they wanted reassurance that, presumably, they were going to be okay. And 60 percent of Hispanic people expected suggestions for symptom relief. That suggests that a few reassuring words from a doctor or nurse might be just as satisfying as a prescription for antibiotics. The findings were largely consistent with previous reports on antibiotic use among Hispanic people. Still, there are a number of limitations to this study. For one thing, the people who answered the survey were mostly white or non-Hispanic; only 38 percent of Hispanic people answered the survey. And the Hispanic people who did answer the survey weren't representative of the national Hispanic population. Overall, they were younger, had lower household incomes, and were more educated than the general Hispanic population. Most respondents were non-Hispanic Finally, the researchers only surveyed people with a phone line, a stable address, and sufficient literacy (if needed, computers and internet were provide to respondents). Given that 14 percent of the US population is considered illiterate, that means that a significant portion of the population wasn't asked about how they use antibiotics. The differences between Hispanic people and the entire population of respondents highlights the importance of considering cultural factors in public health messaging. And in general, the study indicates that a doctor who reassures patients and provides symptom relief might help reduce people's expectations for antibiotics. Nothing is that simple of course — there are a number of social and economic factors at play here — but the survey does demonstrate where government officials and health care providers can make the most impact.",0.42186650775863216,0.5781334922413679,0.8599438419613765,791,5.2996207332490517,374,6.2032085561497325,0,2,Science

If verified by other researchers, the finding means that simply changing the way humans use antibiotics might not be enough to get rid of certain common, resistant bacteria. Bacteria become resistant when they encounter antibiotics in their environment in doses too small to kill them. This encounter allows them to adapt to the drugs in ways that help them survive larger doses later on. And that's a big problem. In the US alone, the cost of treating resistant infections is $21 billion each year. And unfortunately those treatments aren't always successful; each year, antibiotic resistance causes  2 million annual illnesses in the US — and claims about 23,000 lives. The resistant strains were more infectious But here's the thing: until recently, scientists thought they knew how to reduce this global threat. If they could convince doctors and farmers to stop automatically administering antibiotics to their patients and livestock, respectively, researchers might be able to bring back old, drug-susceptible strains. And because these strains didn't suffer the cost of adapting to antibiotics, they would be able to outcompete resistant strains, killing them off in the process. Now, it seems that this scenario might never play out, which means that getting rid of certain species of resistant bacteria will be a lot harder than scientists thought. In the study, researchers inserted mutation-causing DNA into a bacterium called Pseudomonas aeruginosa — a common cause of multidrug-resistant lung infection. The process resulted in the production of over 300,000 different mutant bacterial strains. Then, the researchers infected mice with each of these strains, all at once. The experiment was a battle royale to see which strains would take over  The ensuing experiment was a battle royale of sorts, where the scientists tracked which strains outcompeted the others. Then, to make sure that the strains that had overtaken the mouse weren't getting a boost from each other, the researchers pitted a single mutated strain against the original unmutated bacteria by infecting mouse lungs with both strains at once. Thanks to this approach, the researchers were able to determine that mutations that convey resistance to antibiotics don't weaken a strain — they actually make it fitter.     (Denise Chan / Flickr) The researchers repeated the mouse experiments using Acinetobacter baumannii, another common cause of hospital infections. They also used rabbits to test their findings with the cholera-causing Vibrio cholera. In both instances, they found the same results: the mutations that caused resistance also made the strains stronger and deadlier. Disabling resistant mutations impaired the bacteria’s ability to infect mice  To verify their claims, the researchers then tried the experiment in reverse. To do that, they disabled the genes that naturally confer resistance in P. aeruginosa. The alteration impaired the bacteria’s ability to infect mouse lungs, demonstrating that both natural resistance —  the kind that would pop up in the wild — and lab-generated resistance can enhance bacteria’s ability to infect another living organism. The study is ""convincing — at least for these strains,"" says James Johnson, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Minnesota who didn't work on the study. ""It's not entirely surprising that some mutations that lead to resistance enhance rather than reduce fitness, but surprising that nearly every mutation they studied had this effect."" The results don't demonstrate that every single species of bacteria becomes stronger post mutation. Scientists already have solid evidence that a specific resistant mutation in the bacterium that causes tuberculosis weakens its ability to spread and infect other organisms. But the researchers who conducted this latest study say this result was only obtained for a particular mutation, so it's unclear if other resistant mutations that arise in that species might also cause the strain to be less infectious. Some bacterial species really are weakened by the resistant mutation ""We think both situations are possible"" — depending on the bacterial species in question, explains David Skurnik, a microbiologist at Harvard University and a co-author of the study. Philip Salvatore, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins who didn't work on the study, agrees. ""There is certainly good evidence that some pathogens will revert back to drug susceptibility over time, but there are just as many exceptions to the rule,"" he says. Bacteria continue to develop new mechanisms for resistance, and humans are playing catch-up, Skurnik says. And as this latest study shows, simply changing the way doctors and people in the meat production industry use antibiotics won't be enough to fight off certain strains of resistant bacteria. Other interventions will therefore have to be developed. ""The final take-home message of this and similar other studies is that we cannot assume that drug-resistant bacteria will simply go away on their own over time, with or without new drug development,"" Salvatore says. ""Some drug-resistant bacteria may die off on their own; others may cause more severe disease, may be more contagious, and are certainly more difficult to kill.""",0.5401677947639149,0.45983220523608515,0.8499445017308401,853,5.4478311840562723,436,6.419724770642202,0,2,"Science, Report"

Two new studies published this week in Nature and Science are battling it out over the true origins of Native American ancestry.  Both papers suggest contradictory interpretations of a new perplexing find: some remote populations living in the South American Amazon share a strong genetic connection with the indigenous peoples of Australasia and Melanesia — the regions of Oceania containing Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, and its surrounding islands. Approximately 2 percent of today's Amazonians come from this Australasian lineage. Contradictory interpretations of a new perplexing find That link is surprising; it's not present anywhere else in the Americas, and it seems to upend some previously held theories about where the first Native Americans came from. Many researchers believe that the Americas were populated by a single migration of people from East Asia crossing into America over the Bering Strait. In ancient times, the strait's waters were much lower than they are now, exposing a land bridge that connected Alaska and Siberia. But in light of these new findings, the researchers had a hard time explaining how the Australasian-Amazon link fit into that model. If the Americas were populated by a single migration, then all Native Americans should really only share traits with current East Asian and Siberian populations. ""This link between the Amazon populations and the Australasian populations — this is very surprising to us and to many scientists,"" says Pontus Skoglund, first author of the Nature paper and a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University. ""We spent over a year trying to refine our analysis, and exclude that there are no other explanations."" Skoglund and his research team argue that the Australasian DNA signals in the Amazon mean the single migration theory doesn't work. In fact, they propose that there were at least two additional waves of migrations after the first initial migration of East Asians across the Bering Strait, or perhaps there was a long stream of migrations tens of thousands of years ago. ""There were multiple pulses of people going into the Americas, and these pulses may have been genetically quite similar, but there were at least such differences where we are able to detect this contrast today,"" says Skoglund.   Thousands of years ago, the waters in the Bering Strait were low enough to expose a land bridge that people could walk across. (NASA) Yet researchers at the University of California-Berkeley say that interpretation isn't quite right. They also observed the Australasian-Amazon link during their research, but they argue that the DNA signals don't eliminate the single migration theory. Instead, further tests from the Science team indicate that Population Y — the group of people containing the Australasian link — came to the Americas much later, around 10,000 years ago. ""What we found was that the divergence time between people that landed in East Asia and Native Americans happened about 23,000 years ago,"" says co-author Rasmus Nielsen, from the department of integrative biology at UC Berkeley. Both papers do agree in some ways Nielsen and his team write in Science that when they observed the Australasian signals in the Amazon, they decided to do some more testing. So the researchers extracted additional DNA from the ancient remains of Native American people in Central and South America whose skulls are physically similar to the indigenous Melanesians and Australians of today. They wanted to see how far back this link could be observed. But the DNA of those ancient remains didn't have any affinity to current Australasians; it was just like the DNA of modern Native Americans. ""What does that tell us? It tells us this signal of Melanesian and Australian DNA in Brazil, somewhere in isolated populations, it’s probably not something that's very old,"" says Nielsen. Instead, the Science team offers up another explanation for the link. The researchers also found a few traces of Australasian signals of people living in the Aleutian Islands — a small chain of islands off the southern coast of Alaska. ""If you’re sailing from Siberia to America, you follow this chain of islands,"" says Nielsen. The team theorizes that a much smaller group of people that traveled through the Aleutian Islands brought the Australasian link to America — sometime around 10,000 years ago.   The type of terrain traveled by Native Americans when migrating to the Americas Both papers do agree in some ways; they argue that an additional source population is responsible for this strange Australasian signal in the Amazon. The question is when. ""Neither paper is making an argument that Australians came over and peopled America,"" says Cecil Lewis, an associate professor of anthropological genetics at the University of Oklahoma, who was not involved in either study. ""They're arguing that in the old world and in Siberia and East Asia, there was potentially more than one source population that constituted the gene pool that ended up in the Americas."" There’s no way to know for sure until all possible theories have been explored The Nature team thinks that Population Y came over sometime in ancient times, while the Science team thinks Population Y came over much later. Lewis says both ideas hold merit, and that both research teams are extremely skilled at analyzing genetic data. But he says there's room for questioning both interpretations. Additionally there are even more theories that could explain the Australasian link, says Lewis, who brings up the possibility of genetic drift. ""Genetic drift means when populations reproduce over and over again, we expect their genetic makeup to change slightly from random chance,"" says Lewis. ""When populations are small in size, those random fluctuations are quite pronounced. So one possible explanation is what we’re seeing in the Amazon jungle could be attributable to chance effects.""

It's calming, with pleasant ASMR overtones (because bats apparently can't eat with their mouth shut). If you don't like the sounds of bananas being chewed into mush then you can try grapes instead, and remember about all the good things in your life:  Yep. Bats will pretty much chew any fruit you like into a wet pulp and it's glorious every time. (Disclaimer: though they eat many fruits, they seem to prefer bananas and grapes, but sometimes they bite the grapes and the grapes burst and that's when my heart skips a beat.) Alternately, you can watch this bat squeak in its sleep after a good feed and imagine floating into heaven on a cloud of bliss towed by tiny bats.  Or, pushing out the boat a little, we can combine these two themes and watch a sleeping bat with a mouth full of food, which wakes up and then starts eating again. Really I'm not sure why I ever thought the world was full of suffering when there are so many bats being cute.  All these videos are from a YouTube channel named Megabattie that's run by a ""flying fox carer and rescuer.""

Or it would be, were it not for the sheer number of powerful jet engines, some of which are waiting their turns to have bird carcasses — 2.5 pounds, 4 pounds, 6 pounds, and 8 pounds, all pre-euthanized — hurled into their fan blades. The birds are from local suppliers that are certified by the Department of Natural Resources; GE then x-rays them to make sure they haven’t been shot. An approved bird is then loaded into a cannon device and shot into the engine. I asked about video for posting to this site, but was warned that other people find it disturbing. The video is disturbing. It is also very cool.   Peebles is home to GE Aviation’s Peebles Test Center. Sitting outside ""Disneyland for geeks"" is a crumpled white car with a sign next to it: ""Don’t text and drive."" It’s a real car that really crashed when its driver was texting, says Brian De Bruin, the plant leader at Peebles (""If this is Disneyland for geeks, I guess that makes me Mickey Mouse,"" he says later). Texting and driving is a common problem in rural Adams County, Ohio, the home of the 7,000-acre reserve that tests 1,600 engines a year. The state-of-the-art facility is located in the middle of nowhere to avoid noise pollution. Hawks lazily float on air currents above us, apparently unperturbed by the occasional sound of engines. Peebles was initially opened in 1954, and was intended to test rockets, though that never actually happened. It acquired its modern function in 1965, when GE ran its first test of the TF39 engine there that would eventually power the Air Force’s Lockheed C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft. Security is tight, though the guards are friendly — I arrive a little early and am directed to wait for Jamie Jewell, the spokeswoman for CFM, GE’s joint venture with French company Snecma (which startles me every time someone says it aloud — I cannot help but hear the mondegreen ""smegma""). Jewell arrives with De Bruin, and we all pile into a minivan. I am very much hoping that I will be able to witness engine tests, but first, Jewell and Chris Nye, marketing manager for Leap, walk me through a video of the brand-new Leap engines — turbofans that will find their way into next-generation midsize airliners from Airbus, Boeing, and China’s COMAC. GE currently is producing one engine every four hours. The Leap testing, conducted primarily at Peebles, is meant to be complete by the end of this year. There are, of course, the FAA standards — and meeting them means that GE engines are cleared for China as well. There’s the over-torque test and teardown inspection, meant to give regulators an idea of the wear and tear the engines may face during their lifetimes; during these tests, the engines experience extreme conditions, meant to determine their durability. There’s the vibration test and the corrosion test; the thermal fatigue test and damage tolerance test; the crosswinds test and acoustic tests. Then there are the fun tests: birds, volcanic ash, dust ingestion, and hail. But Leap is still undergoing certification testing, the bulk of which is expected to be done by the end of this year. They’ve already finished the bird test and another test, the ""blade-out,"" which I think I like even better than the bird test. Here’s what a blade-out is: a thumb-sized amount of the explosive C-4 is attached to a blade’s base. Once the engine is running at full power, the C-4 explodes, knocking out the blade. The test is to show the engine can contain the lost blade — no one wants it to go careening into the passengers onboard the plane — and that the engine won’t catch fire. Once the engine is running at full power, the C-4 explodes, knocking out the blade It’s De Bruin’s least favorite test because it destroys the engine. ""That makes me sad,"" he says. The engines have to be durable enough to stand this kind of rough treatment, but they also must be light. Engines are, of course, hung under the wing — where they create drag, so engines must generate the needed thrust to get the airplane off the ground while minimizing weight penalties — the thrust-to-weight ratio is seven to one on the Leap engines. And the heavier the engine and the plane, the more fuel it burns. Fuel is expensive, accounting for more than a quarter of airlines’ operating costs — the single largest cost most airlines have. In the interest of saving weight, Snecma uses 11 miles of carbon fiber woven into each of its Leap blades, like a T-shirt woven on a loom, with a titanium leading edge. That’s for the birds — it’s essentially a knifeblade. The engine also boasts ceramic components to improve fuel performance and 3D-printed fuel nozzles. Once I’ve been briefed on the Leap engine, it’s time for a tour of the facilities. Engines are frequently assembled at Peebles, since a shipping route through the Cumberland Gap is easier for trucks with lower weight — a fully assembled engine is heavy, and would limit shipping to a few daylight hours. (The GE90–115B, which is found on Boeing 777s, weighs 18,000 pounds and is about 11 feet in diameter.) So the production engines are brought to Peebles in pieces and then put together and tested for two days before being shipped for placement on planes. We enter a warehouse that exists for this purpose; Depeche Mode is playing over the speaker system. Next, we head to a frankly enormous indoor testing facility — one that cost $40 million to build. The sites are like oversized garages, with cranes above to help maneuver engines into place. Acoustic tests take place there, but so do a lot of the tests that take place outdoors — the idea was, essentially, to create a site that wouldn’t be impacted by the weather. Overall, there are four enclosed test sites and seven open ones. ""Now, we’re going to go up the hill,"" De Bruin says. As we begin to wind up what is, indeed, a very tall hill, he points out the original rocket testing stand, as well as what he calls ""the holler"" — Appalachian slang for a hollow between two hills (or mountains, as the case may be). It is littered with old engines and parts. If anything goes wrong on an engine in production — or if a customer or the FAA has important questions — these old engines can be pulled out to be tested. It is far and away the most expensive holler I have ever witnessed.   At the top of the hill are a series of open test sites. At one, a massive machine makes ice sheets and hail to be tossed into the roaring turbofans — and if the hail isn’t large enough for testing specs, it’s melted and reformed. This site is out of production in the summertime, since the heat melts the ice used for testing. Getting the ice sheets into the engines is particularly tricky: engineers must hurl the non-aerodynamic slabs at the engines and hope for the best. It’s like trying to throw a leaf into a garbage can from several feet away, De Bruin says. Very large honeycombed structures — they’re called turbulence control structures and inevitably bring to mind Epcot Center — litter the sites. These oversized golf balls essentially help control the airflow into engines during testing. Nearby, De Bruin points out a modified cherrypicker — engineers had trouble using the regular ones, and so they made a DIY version by fastening the hydraulic system to a flatbed truck. Though they’d built it, the engineers were too spooked to use it — but it served as a prototype for models that now dot Peebles. In fact, I didn’t see any live engine tests while I was on-site, which seemed like a shame. Four Leap engines were scheduled to be tested, and while I saw some of them in the rigs, I didn’t see the tests themselves — apparently I arrived just in time for a lunch break and a shift change. What I did see was a video, and a 3D rendering of the Leap engine, and many of the customized test rigs. In fact, I had to spend a lot of quality time hearing facts about the new Leap engine. What I discovered was that my time as a pharmaceutical and biotechnology reporter has made me jaded; anything ready for its commercial launch I automatically regard as old and busted; the new hotness — the thing that could tank the company if anything goes wrong — is usually a few phases of testing behind. De Bruin and Jewell return me to the guardhouse — some locals call Peebles the ""Area 51 of Ohio"" for its tight security — and I get back into my car. The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and somewhere, very close to where I am turning the key in my ignition, a jet engine is about to be abused.   Correction: This article originally stated one engine will be produced every five hours; in fact, it is four. In addition, Snecma, not GE, produces the carbon fiber fan blades.
