    "Non Technical by Tom Mitchell:\n",
    "*How can we build computer systems that automatically improve with experience, and what are the fundamental laws that govern all learning processes?*\n",

    "Technical:\n",
    "*A computer program is said to **learn** from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$, if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measuured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.*\n",

    "1. **Supervised Learning** (Includes two major sub groups: classification and regression). **Classification:** The prediction of categorical information. **Regression:** prediction of a continous output.\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning**. You have inputs only, no predefined organization or prediciton, we want to see what clusters exist or some kinds of patters.\n",
    "3. **Reinforcement Learning**. Trying to learn a sequence of actions that have a cumulative effect. Here we are optimizing a cost/reward that exists for executing a sequence of tasks.\n",

    "In this course we will only focus on Supervised Learning"
