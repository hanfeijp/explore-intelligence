# Explore Intelligence
*Repository for all code and notes used to learn data analysis, visualisation, machine learning, artificial intelligence and probability and statistics*

Recently I've been quite enchanted by the world of data driven decision making and due to this I have now made a concious effort to learn as much as I can about it. My major Quantitative Biology gives me the mathematical and comptuational tools to do this and I should be able to apply it to many different problems. Below are the resources I am using to complete my journey.
